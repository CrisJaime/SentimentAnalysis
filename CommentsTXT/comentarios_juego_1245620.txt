Elden Ring: The Epic Adventure You Never Knew You Needed!

Are you ready to dive into a world where dying repeatedly is just part of the fun? Look no further than Elden Ring!
Get ready to spend hours wandering aimlessly through stunning landscapes, only to be brutally murdered by the first enemy you encounter. It's all part of the charm!
With a story line so convoluted, you'll need a degree in cryptic messages to figure out what's going on. Who needs a coherent plot anyway?
The game's difficulty level is like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. But hey, what's life without a little challenge, right?
Enjoy the satisfaction of finally defeating a boss, only to realize you've been fighting the tutorial boss all along. Surprise!
Forget about sleep, food, or social interaction. Elden Ring demands your full attention, and it won't take no for an answer!
Experience the thrill of exploration as you stumble upon hidden treasures, secret pathways, and deadly traps that make you question your life choices.
In conclusion, Elden Ring is like a roller coaster ride through a maze of chaos, despair, and occasional moments of triumph. So buckle up, embrace the madness, and remember: Praise the Sun (or whatever's left of it)!
Better than Dark Souls
hallo
this game made me a sigma heh
Yes very good.
Go bonk
Go burn
Go slash
Much good time
10/10 would bang head against brickwall
It's like stepping into a painting.
ok
fun
Fantastic open world, character progression and combat. This is one of the few games that truly deserves 10/10.
Finger required ahead
This game is just wow, the world is super cool, and the game is super challenging. Over all i give it a 8/10
GOTY
best game ever
good
very good game a good challenge
I have no idea wtf im doing, but im having fun?

(Seriously can someone tell me what to do??? Ive just been wondering this place and finding shit absolutely clueless. WHERE DO I FIND BOSSES TO GET MY ASS KICKED???)
Absolutely amazing game. Must buy. Goes into my top list.

In the grand scheme of amazing games, this feels like a successor to Skyrim.

I had never played any souls-like and had to push hard to accept and get used to the difficulty. Now I'm over 100 hours in and probably not even half into the base game and feeling more excited about it every day.

Play it now.
Love it
Great game
I fucking hate this game. 10/10, would recommend
Based
Man I tried the game played for 1.3 hours it wasn't what i excepted. May be I should try to play more? Hope to change my mind I think this game have a lit of potential.
I don't do drugs anymore. Becoming the Elden Lord and being revived just to suffer is my new drug. And it's called "Masochism"
GOAT of GOAT's
Nice game get mad ez bozo

I died a lot
Elden. Ring.
good
The GOAT
Great game with a lot of room for self expression and satisfying gameplay. Also sporting a beautiful and timeless landscape.
yes, indeed
I just like this game.
Amazing game, original and enjoyable even though its hard, which gives a truly unique experience and has lots of hours of playtime and many secrets.
great
It's alright I guess.

[h1]If you have ever been on the fence about [i]difficult[/i] games, this is the best one to start with![/h1]
 
This was my first souls game from From Software, so I was pretty terrible at first but something about this game kept me coming back. From walking out to see the Erdtree for the first time to realizing the mind blowing size of the multi layered map as I traveled down the wells, I was (and still am) hooked. I almost never buy games that are not on sale but the game design is like nothing out there. I bought the game on release for the PC and was completely absorbed for those two weeks. Afterwords I bought the game for PlayStation (my main gaming platform) and beat it again because I loved it so much. Worth every penny

The curiosity the world fills you with to explore anything that looks interesting always leads to a fun adventure. And the combat and weapons are top notch. So many different ways to tackle the challenges the game throws at you. I have done playthroughs with Blood katanas, Magic, Faith, Dragons and Strength builds and all are fun and unique. The boss variety is insane and each playthrough brings new challenges. 

Some of the negatives I have of the game is that it was very hard for me to understand the great lore of the game without watching Vaati Vidya on YT. Some recent patches to the game have improved this but my first playthrough I was lost and in awe most of the time wishing I knew more of what was going on. And screw the crustaceans and birds in this game!! Starting a new character after beating the game a few times can also be a bit of a drag because the game is so big. It's impossible to remember where everything is and the joy of exploring isnt the same on subsequent playthroughs.

Don't be scared to use the tools given to you to help overcome challenges, its not cheating. From spirit ashes, summons, over leveling or watching YT guides you can (and will) beat anything in this game. And while your first playthrough is the most impactful, theres so much to do in the game that I was still finding new areas and bosses in my 3rd or 4th playthrough. Not to mention when you become worn out and want a new game like ER, From Software has 5-7 more premium titles to get sucked into. And it runs great on the steam deck!

BEST GAME EVER
please add gory tits, otherwise best game every created to the smallest extent!
Amazing Game
If you have ever been interested in souls games, I'd say play this game, predecessors are good but I feel you can just play this, If you get hooked, go play the others if you want more. But this should be all you need,

It's good fun if you like to be challenged, has a lot of lore and expansive landscapes.


New DLC soon too? sounds good.
Great Stars my beloved, reminds me of my good old Bloodletter

Amazing.
This game gave me hyper ring sting
It's totally awesome!

Easy Game = No, fun game = for sure, depression = yes, maybe best game of the decade = Hell yeah
Gave me a boner
Hark, ye denizens of gaming realms, for I bring thee tidings of Elden Ring, a creation most divine. 'Tis a tapestry woven with threads of valor, despair, and unyielding challenge, a testament to the craftsmanship of FromSoftware. Lo, I declare unto thee, this game deserveth naught but the highest praise, a perfect score of ten upon ten.

From the very moment thy journey doth commence, thou art greeted by a world both wondrous and treacherous. The lands between beckon thee with open arms, yet harbor dangers most insidious. Each step taketh one further into the abyss of lore and mystery, where secrets lie in wait for the curious and the brave.

The combat, oh, how it doth sing with the clamor of steel upon steel! Every encounter, a dance of death, where skill and strategy art paramount. To falter is to face ruin, yet to persevere is to taste the sweetest nectar of victory. The bosses, they tower like the great behemoths of yore, each a test of mettle and might, demanding respect and cunning from those who dare oppose them.

Verily, the world itself is a character, alive with beauty and terror. From the towering spires of ancient keeps to the darkened depths of forgotten dungeons, every locale doth tell its own tale. The art and design are a feast for the eyes, and the music, a balm for the weary soul, enhancing every moment with a symphony of epic grandeur.

Yet, 'tis not merely the grandiosity that doth captivate, but the minutiae as well. The lore, penned by the sagacious hand of George R.R. Martin, is deep and compelling, weaving a narrative that ensnares the mind and stirs the heart. The characters, though fleeting in their presence, leave an indelible mark, their stories intertwined with thy own.

In truth, Elden Ring is a game that doth transcend mere entertainment. It is a journey, a trial, and a triumph, crafted with the utmost care and reverence for the art of game-making. 'Tis a beacon of what gaming can achieve, a paragon of its kind.

So, to thee, fellow adventurers, I say: Take up thy controller, steel thy nerves, and embrace the challenge that is Elden Ring. For in its trials and tribulations, thou shalt find the truest form of glory.

Huzzah! Elden Ring is a masterpiece worthy of legends, a ten out of ten, and a tale for the ages.
amazing game
game go brrrrrrr

LOVE IT.
Do I really have to write a review on how godly this game is?
Elden Ring has been a Truly a masterpiece, I've always hated how easy games had gotten until i played elden ring and damn, i never had so much fun playing something this hard before. The open world was a bliss to go through, each boss felt fresh. I never once get bored while playing( i did get lost alot) But the story this game tells is like none other. Truly a 10/10 game
I LOOOOOOVE THIS SHIT, YES I'm MENTALY UNSTABLE AFTER THIS GAME AND?
Try Finger, But Hole
good
Game is pretty good but there's no femboys? Which means Dark Souls 1 is still the only good game Fromsoft has ever made.

Hoping the DLC fixes this issue.
Guys help
I think my game is bugged

[spoiler]Melania won't stop introducing herself
Any fixes?[/spoiler]
By far one of the best games ever.
Didn't expect less of the company who made the Dark Souls trilogy and started the Souls-like genre.
A massive open world spectacle with the dangers we're used to meticulously developed by from soft.
A must have in your game library.

Who needs "AAA or mtx gaming" when you have behemoths like From Software crafting banger after banger.
best goat challenging if you want it to be and easy if you dont. just play it

fun
e Sigma approves

i hate it but i love it
its pretty good :)

KILL THE GODS AND BREAK THEIR THRONES
fre
Masterpiece
Gameplay is solid. Combat is fast, yet tactical. 
The world and atmosphere is fantastic.

Bonus:
It's a game. And not a complicated slot machine trying to get into your wallet by tickling your brain in just the right places.
It doesn't tell you what to do. If it does tell you what to do, it's only suggestive, you don't need to do that.
Truly remarkable.
Game is good! Conniptions is not good!
mohg lord of blood
This game honestly doesn't need a review. If you haven't heard of it by now you're living under a rock. Just play the game, fuck around, and find out.
CERTIFIED BANGER!
ITs littery a game where you only have to be patient to win, nothing fun about being patient the entire game because of how shitty the characters you choose are.
Gaming, I love Gaming, this game make u love and hate gaming at the same time. 10/10 would recommend
amazing game, but forever maidenless...
This was my first step into the souls. I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined. Beautiful. Challenging. The best. If you‚Äôre on the fence, just do it. You won‚Äôt regret it!

Game simply won't launch.  Uninstalled, reinstalled, verified game files.
BEST GAME EVER MADE 10/10
fun
You have to get naked to get one of the endings...
An epic dark fantasy game that is very challenging and rewarding.  This game at first seems overwhelming but with patience and practice you can make steady progress through a vibrant world of grand adventure. You can enjoy this game for hours on end, just be ready to die and be reborn...often.
This game is awesome, I've played over 1k hours (I've played on other consoles as well as steam) and I still don't get bored. It's a game that makes you feel strong and unstoppable until you run into that next boss. Unlike other games, this game doesn't just require better gear to progress, it requires actual skill and you need to know what you're doing if you wanna succeed. The best part of the game though is the satisfaction after killing that one boss that you've been stuck on, it gives a sense of pride and happiness that no other game has given me. Finally right now is a great time to get the game (as of posting the review) because the dlc is coming out in 10 days. Again great game would highly recommend to everyone.
F**K THIS GAME.

this game may be difficult but does it match the power of the indomitable human spirit?
it good
GOAT
Way too good, we do not deserve it.
How do I kill The tutorial boss? Any help?
Best game I have ever played. This is not an overexaggeration it will suck you hard and you will leave satisfied.
Game is really good delivering both great graphics (especially the colours from what we have experienced in DS3) and game play. Although game is way too hard after it's a FROMSOFTWARE game, it's fun to play especially, the variety of weapons.
it goes hard
Its Pretty good
it's okay but port bloodborne already goddamn
Not bad.
Best game of all time
TARNISED
Good game but it makes me want to cry
excellent
I think it's alright?
In all fairness this game is really good and a masterpiece in almost every way. However there are a few things that keep me from giving this a 10/10 and will stay at a 9/10. Some bosses or dungeon bosses feel like a large difficulty spike after beating literal gods or demigods. Two of these instances were the Valiant Gargoyles and Black Knife Tiche. Don't get me wrong I love a good challenge but like I just fought a literal void god in Astel and now this random assassin is fucking me up more than he could? And those fucking gargoyles love to spam poison breath which seems like an oversight. There are a few others like this but these were my main two.

My other "complaint" is more a personal preference and I know people disagree based on how they like to play. That being said, I would have liked some more QOL changes such as letting me know when I've completed a dungeon, a little clearer on where certain NPCs are, and a basic quest tracker. Now I know what you're thinking by that last part but hear me out. I don't need the game to hold my hand and tell me exactly where to go and what to do but I would like keeping them organized and at least some very basic information about what to do. For example once you start certain NPC questlines like Ranni or Sellen letting us see our current task maybe just as simple as find the city of Nokron would be appreciated keeping it organized. As for the main quest, something along the lines of once you have two great runes and talk to Ofnir, just a little note in the tracker saying "Journey to the capital Leyndell".

This game is amazing and I think we all know it. I will say that even has a dark souls and Sekiro player that Elden Ring's gameplay is faster and demands more practice. The transition from mid to late game also kind of comes out of no where and can throw off the momentum of your build. These are more specific nit picking and should not stop you from experiencing this game.
Ong, Elden ring is the most fun I have had in a while.  Deserved goty and more.  Play this.
super fun, lots secrets
THIS GAMES GONNA MAKE YOUR LITTLE NUTS QUAKE THATS MY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
great game beat me harder than i beat my son
FOR DEMACIA !
peakk
Good :)
Hands the best game a gamer can play..Best Open World a game can offer ...
great game
Like.
BECOME THE ELDEN LORD
.
The best game ever
Still no ultra wide screen support as well as bad optimization.
Praise the sun!
Praise the Elden Ring!
Praise FromSoftware!
My deaths on this game might be countless but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. Not a masochist btw
shit slaps
i was very skepically to play this. most ppl told me to try it..  i was like 89.99??  i am at point of buying base plus next extension that came out a few months ago from today.    so i got base just to see the feeling.   it is almost like metal solid gear without techs crossover with demon souls for fighting rolling style.    recommeneded if anyone plays sf or tekken before for mostly parry, block, dodge hit. 

enjoy :-)   just got this game almost a week ago from today date.
Gameplay: 10/10
What should I say, ist's the perfect Dark Souls formula on steroids plus open world.

Immersion: 8/10
The world building is very good but small details break the immersion for me. Very view towns with neutral or friendly NPCs is my little critique.

Graphic: 9/10
The breathtaking views nailed it for me. Animations are on top but some visual effects could be better.

Miscellaneous: 9/10
No support for ultra-wide is a no go in 2024 but the mod's help in this department. The seamless co-op mod is also a game breaker for play with friends.
When I play Elden Ring all I think about is Elden Ring and when im not playing Elden Ring all I think about is Elden Ring
++++

goddammit it's hard af my guy
I like being a masochist. I like this game.
One of if not the best game I've ever played.
I love goat amor
true masterpiece
After putting thousands of hours into the souls games, time and time again, NG+ after NG+, picking this game up and playing it 100% the way through really shows how much Fromsofts studio has improved. The world, the combat, and especially the in depth lore.. it all 10/10. I'm not sure how i'm ever going to play another RPG without having high expectations.... Dark souls, Bloodborne, and Elden ring has pretty much ruined any other game for me. The quality of this game and every game before it has pretty much set the standard for every game going forward.

11/10 Praise the sun, Bearer of the cure, Ashen one, Burn the erdtree to the ground!
i love this game 10/10
RANNI IS QUEEN

I loved the part where the ring said ''its eldening time'' and eldened all over the place.
And yes I'm pre-ordering the dlc.
mmmf
my prodigious might can only be hampered by the damage taken through gravity. i am an unstoppable force, unable to quell my thirst for these bosses. as i scour the lands, i will take down every last enemy. lest that enemy be fall damage. to hell with fall damage.
simply a masterpiece. only banana game come close

Yes
Elden Ring is great, I've played to ng+3 on steam and ng+4 on Ps5. Ive even made a brand new character so that I can experience the dlc without being over leveled or with the difficulty of ng+3. Very good game as versatile as a coffee bean grinder. the funny thing about coffee bean grinders is that they can be used to grind up other things.
Unbelievable
game hard, game good
Epic

Greatest game ever made.
Architecture & Scale... two things I find absolutely jaw dropping.  Don't get me wrong, the game play is engrossing and often times takes you by surprise while refusing to let go.  The world as a whole is unlike any other I've experienced in gaming.  You marvel at the scene laid out before you, standing there awestruck at the scale of the structures you explore... at least, I do.  I have spent many hours just admiring the world you've created and how amazing it is to behold.  It's not just a game, it's an experience.  One you don't want to miss
don't really like souls games. loved this one
I like it
Why are you looking at THIS recommendation? There are way better ones than mine, and you don't even  know me.
super game
Good game, but basically I just want steam to stop annoy me with this message
I got as many hours in lore videos as I do in game.

game of the year
Game is phenomenal. Take your time to play this, its totally worth it. You dont want to get 100 hrs into the game and be like "dang i shouldnt have spoiled myself". Its worth to do multiple playthroughs to do NPC quest you dont know about. USE THE WIKI TO HELP IF YOU ARE STUCK!!!

Fun. but man is it infuriating.
prettiest game ive ever played <3
best game ever
good times

It's alright
By far one of the most relaxing platform games there is. 

Do you like Crash Bandicot? Do you like Super Mario Brothers? 

Do you hate games that allows folks to join your live play and kill you? 

Look no further. This game only has the positives you'd expect with games like Crash Bandicot. And none of the negatives you've seen in previous dark souls games. Things like a level 10 player with end game equipment invading you at the start of the game never happens. Great times.
What an amazing game! Wonder why i didnt play it when it released
Amazing
.
Honestly one of the best games I've ever played.
Its Elden Ring..........just play it.
One of the greatest gaming experiences of our time!
Difficult and rewarding
Git Gud, I did

I must admit that I never played a souls-like game before (because i was a coward) but this game just made me love the genre. Did I finish the game? Nope. Will I replay after the release of the DLC? YES. 
And don't forget, you don't need to finish a game to love it. 60 hours of fun was def. worth every penny.
:)
good
pretty fun

This game is a masterpiece. It is also the only game I've ever cared to get all achievements.
Elden Ring is a triumph of modern game design. The soundtrack, art direction, and game design all come together to create a Masterpiece. There is also a beautiful story to uncover if you are willing to explore and uncover every hidden part of the world. I only have a few critiques: Locked FPS is a bummer. KB&M controls need optimization. Overall I would highly recommend even at full price. 10/10
Angry? Lonely? Full of a rage? Come no further! Welcome to the Lands Between, where you will have the ability to vent all your anger and accumulate more!
this is the dark souls of open world games
Easy beginner game for all ages!
big monsters mmm coom
Get mad, throw controller, have a life crisis and come back and finish the fight 10/10 God
Best shit ever
My life revolves around elden ring
chicken curry tastes nice
If you like the souls/borne games, then you'll have a great time with this.

i fucking hate this game
El mejor juego
I'll never find a lover...
HARD BUTt FUN
it fucking sucks. there is no explation on how to play and it just drops you on toy ass i cant even figure out anyhting with out looking it up on google. if you never played a soles game getfuked you cant join in unlessss you played it back in the day. enjoy reserching the game alot.
I love this game, my favorite character is Elden John
haha Tuli J√§tti :-)

The freedom of this game is what makes this game one of the best games.
This game is like hating that cool kid in elementary school and then by the time you graduate high school, he/she is your closest and most treasured friend

Its to good to pass

A good soulslike. Has more of an open world feel than Dark Souls 1 (only other Soulslike I've played).
Its the very best

its fun
excellent, but does lag on a less than stellar rig.
I love it. I started late and it's one of my favorite games of all time!
ITS alright DS3 better tho

The hours played probably speaks for itself.
pain and agony :)
i like pain yes

great game. death rite bird kys
As a Souls Enjoyer with about 2k hours across the fromsoft library. this game is a flawed masterpiece. Your first playthrough, for the first 2/3rds of the game will be some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. That last 1/3rd is just as magical, buuuuuuuuut. The end game feels like it's been balanced by a 3rd grade bully. Too many stunlocks in the form of 2-3 attack combos that feel like a 1 shot. That harsh trial and error, is not fun. Using a max health regen build with 45-50 vigor.  With at least 3 full completions of every fromsoft Souls game(ok one and a half for demon souls), I comfortably say these numbers are a deep departure from the usual formula. 
I blame the introduction of spirit ashes, Theyre a wonderful tool that you're welcome to use. However I believe fromsoft tried to please everyone here and missed the mark. The bosses are all built to be solo-able to please the purists, but I believe they're aggressively balanced with the assumption you're bringing spirit ashes into the fight. 
Bosses and mobs also literally re-act to your inputs for the first time in the series. Not with a delay that might reflect the AI reacting to your character's actions. But they will fly right into a full combo exactly when you hit that estus button. The animations often occur simultaneously. But the bosses are massively varied and fun, the visuals are majestic and intense. There are more secrets than a Sanderson novel. almost a perfect game. If they just did something about that end game balancing. . . .
masterpiece
stress
very good

fortnite
Shadow of the Erdtree hypeeeee
First Fromsoftware game, 10/10 masterpiece .The lore the atmosphere the music the gameplay all s tier.  Cant wait for the DLC
thou hast maiden
Definitely one of the best games I've played in my life. It was the first time I played a souls like game and I lost count of how many times I died playing this game. If you like challenges I really recommend this game and nothing can be more rewarding than killing a boss that has killed you multiple times. I wish I had played this game sooner and I know you will feel the same. So arise now, ye Tarnished and become Elden Lord!
it is a game that is fun. it is a game that is not fun. it is a game that i love <3
Literally one of the best games I've ever played! Everything in Elden Ring is done to an extreme level, the combat is exactly what you want from a FromSoftware Souls title, detail is to the max, story is incredibly rich, all the boss fights feel unique, all the different zones feel unique. I listen to lore podcasts about this game while on long road trips. It's so incredible I recommend everyone play it!
Easy Mode John Off
amazing
great
Play game, game is good.
Amazing game, better when you got a friend to play with, much rage, much fun.
good game
no sex yet :[
We all have one week left to get good
big sword go bonk
worst game ever made lol losers like this?
boss hard :)
I'm Hard >:)
one of the very best games to ever be released. better than the souls games, better than bloodborne and in every sense a masterpiece. bosses are amazing, the amount of replayability, the value which is hard to get in games anymore. all true gamers should own this game. 10/10 and very few games earn this from the likes of me.
Games GOATED.
While I did at times feel some open world fatigue, a fantastic game overall.
if you adore souls like games then you would love this game, they have a new dlc coming out as of next friday. but all around a great challenging game

i will always solo her
wasnt good 
hated game 
took some time 
got good

As long as you beat the game only then can you tell how great this game is.

This is my favorite entry in the Monster Hunter franchise.

great game
this is my first soulslike game and i have say that it's hard asf, but the moment you finally kill that boss on the 78th try is amazing!
It's Elden Ring
Incredibly difficult at times, yet incredibly rewarding and one of the most engaging and captivating experiences I've had gaming.
I love Dark Souls 2 2
dog
git gut
I have been playing off and on for 2 years, haven't finished it. Never beaten a souls game. 10/10 buy this game it's great.
Maidenless, but still felling the Lords.
Easy
One of the best games if not the best, this what Elden Ring give me:
1- Fun
2- Rage
3- Pain
4- crying
5- Stress
6- Enjoyment
7- Heartbreak
8- Parkour Deaths
9- Good Memories
10- Bad Horse Physics
The game is worth every bit of your time and attention. It captivates you from start to finish, with immersive gameplay ,storyline, world, difficulty, enemies that keep you engaged for hours on end.

-Tarnished
just fucking play it
One of the best games I've ever played, it can be a challenge but it teaches you to never give up.
I can't wait for the DLC!
gud game
literally had to buy this game twice it was so fun lol ready for the DLC!
I was not sure I would like this game bc it is so daunting to players like me who think slower and don't react fast enough, but I found fun ways to play and enjoy the process anyway. Highly recommend FightinCowboy's walkthrough on YouTube for knowing what to do. I only have 2 achievements left now and can't wait for DLC. I think the story is better than LOTR (just personal opinion) in many ways. Very much recommend this game for anyone who likes a challenge, or art, or experiencing a modern masterpiece. It has its issues but is so of the most fun I've had in a long time.
It's good
A fantastic game that I cannot recommend enough! Graphics, story, and the world are simply fantastic!

gud game, but has DRM anti-cheat (thats not mentioned on the store page) which blocks support for ultrawide monitors
A beautiful and immersive game, not to mention very challenging but o so rewarding when you succeed.

funm
this game has so many problems and flaws and things that I genuinely hate, but its so good that the good far out ways the bad, to the extent that I think every one with a pulse should play it.
Came back to start playing again to prepare for the DLC coming and who would've guessed all of my characters are gone. Time wasted on a game once enjoyed.
This game slaps harder then my dad
A Masterpiece
11/10
this game also makes me want to punch every kid i see in walmart
I reccomend this game to all my friends all the time, it is so AMAZING!!!!! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BUT IT PLAYBOIIIIII, I NEED TO PLAY WITH YOU!!!!
It my first review, just don't look at the play time
Its alright
I'm bad at this game. Blasphemous Blade, Eclipse Crest Great Shield, Clawmark Seal, Mimic Tear. Spam Taker's Flames while holding shield a lot. As long as it works.
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT THE GOATTTTTTTTT
Has swamps and feet
Best game ever, enough said!!
Amazing game!
why can i leave a review
u can pass Tree Sentinel at the start
So I guess you don't have to beat the tree sentinel at the start with base weapons! Good To know after the fact!! :)

only place i can get a hug... 10/10
best game ever
Compared to the rest of the Souls/Borne titles, Elden Ring is by far the most accessible and casual. Players like myself who cut their teeth on original Souls may be somewhat disappointed, however those who are new to the series may find much more enjoyment in Elden Ring than they would in the other more "hardcore" entries.

The open world adds about as much as it detracts from the experience. It's certainly a breath of fresh air in many ways. It is almost a meditative experience to ride around on your horse, occasionally finding dungeons to explore or a random NPC. The content is typically dense enough to justify the massive size of the map. However, there are some locations on the map that essentially amount to sprawling nothingness. Ultimately, the best most memorable parts of the game are the segments which are more linear, as they provide a tighter, denser, more entertaining and comprehensive experience. 

NPC questlines are more frustrating than ever before. Forget trying to complete any questlines without a guide. Even when you do happen to encounter an NPC, they generally do not give any indication of how to proceed with their questline. Previous titles were able to get away with this somewhat, but Elden Ring's size alone makes completing these quests on your own nearly impossible. 

The lore in this entry is extremely vague and difficult to follow, as usual for the series. But this time there is also a very confusing naming scheme. All important characters in this game have extremely similar sounding names, which makes keeping track of who is who extremely painful. Malenia, Melina, Miquella, Maliketh. Godfrey, Godrick, Godwyn, Godefroy. Thankfully, you can simply ignore the deeper story of the game without missing out on much.

The multiplayer aspect of this game is much weaker than the others. You cannot be invaded when playing solo. Likewise, when you can only invade players who have at least one summon. Therefore, you are generally forced to fight 2v1 in PVP. Even as someone who never really engaged in PVP, I was disappointed by this. Getting invaded at a critical moment was always an unforgettably exciting experience that you will never have in this game. 

Thankfully, Elden Ring excels at what are essentially the main selling points of every game in this series: gameplay and boss fights. The gameplay is tight, fluid, polished, and fun. The boss fights are diverse and challenging. For every great boss in this game there are ten mediocre bosses, but that is somewhat inevitable for a game of this size. The great bosses more than make up for the mediocre ones, and even the mediocre bosses are still fun to fight and pad out the content of the game.

Judging Elden Ring by its own merit independent of its sibling titles, its a very well made and highly polished hardcore open-world RPG. Even judging it alongside its predecessors, I couldn't say Elden Ring falls short of the standard. It is by far the most ambitious title in the series, and that naturally results in various shortcomings. But despite those issues it is undeniably impressively well designed. 

Not my favorite Souls/Borne title, but still highly recommended.

BGE
sure
10/10
Unga Bunga Approved!
Difficult but adventurous and exciting game. Tons of content and huge open world map with cool events and boss fights.
i review this game: Bloodborne 2 / 10 stars

a masterpiece...
gud
Epic, this is a gold standard for developers.
very good
very good game
My brother bought me this game as a gift. This game is a 10/10 masterpiece. Choose to play how you want: Follow a guide or follow your heart. The game is full of surprises, secrets, and just utter beauty. Punishing at times and oh so rewarding other times. You will, without a doubt, love this game. Keep in mind that if you've never played a souls-like game before, like myself, you will be doing yourself a disservice by not giving this game a try. I will say, I did look things up to have an idea of where to go at my level, but nothing was spoiled. I know it can be brutal, horrifying, and punishing consistently, but the game is just undeniably beautiful. The times you win are amazing. The times you lose, gives you a chance to learn. I've beaten the game and have not started a NG+, but I am waiting for the DLC to come out so that I can instantly progress into the new story. Now tarnished...are you ready to begin your journey in the Lands Between?
lit
all i'm going to say is, if i had to choose ONE thing to erase from my memory and do all over again from the beginning, it would be elden ring! (i think that says a lot about the QUALITY of this game 10/10 goat!)

You can hug a woman
fffg
worthless
good game
GOOD STUFF
kinda fun game part tarnished
every ring has its elden
good but hard
Absolute MASTERPIECE
I like


Super hard. so much fun.
I haven't played this game since about a month or two after release. Did about two NG+ runs and got wiped out from the loop. At the time they hadn't patched the Rivers of Blood and it made the game and boss fights so unbelievably trivial. 
Malenia, who? Rivers of Blood with the clone spirit, done in one go. Cool.
Malikith, who? Same as above.

Weapon Arts were a dope addition to the souls format and FromSoft did an amazing job bringing the Dark souls esque world to an open world, but taking 3 months to patch out weapons/arts that should've been balanced during the playtests before release was a blunder. Made any future additions to Elden Ring, like this new DLC seem boring and redundant.
GOAT
single handedly got me into gaming
it's tough but it's so much fun and such silly crap in the lore that makes you laugh out loud.  fingers

best game i have ever played
best game ever
Yes
This is my one of my favorite games of all time. It is up there with the Witcher 3 in terms of open world adventure. It is also not terribly difficult. Many of the items and buffs(grant strength, golden vow, physic,wizard builds, etc) make the game have a easy mode if you are not in it for the difficulty. Great story telling like all the soulsbourn games and such a beautiful open world to get lost in.

Loss is my biggest motivator
very pretty fun combat.
Game is good. buy it full price.

Yea this is pretty good
the best game
not bad - but not game of the year

torrent and the summons are the only thing that makes it playable

the restrictions in certain areas is annoying
bossfights where u have to run after are boring while they enjoy the mobility u cant use or have
fighting a KI / cheatengine only to find a spot to attack or heal ?

the story is boring and after 100h it loses connection to everything ur doin in the game

Why fight Male Lucky Fluid as Final Boss? 10/10
im too shit for this
El juego es muy dificil de entender si es tu primer souls (c√≥mo el m√≠o), solo busca informaci√≥n sobre c√≥mo usar los items porque es lo qu√© m√°s me cost√≥.
Fuera de eso, es una chulada de juego, la m√∫sica es incre√≠ble (usen aud√≠fonos 100% recomendado). Tengo m√°s de 100 hrs jugadas y siento me falta muchisimo por explorar. Hay demasiadas cosas por hacer y demasiadas armas para cualquier gusto. 

Excelente videojuego! Hace mucho no me met√≠a tanto en un game single player!
anyone got a link for Melina feet mod? thanks
The only game where i had to stop in place, and admire the scenery in awe...

Amazing game
This game is a masterpiece!
Amazing story building and fantastic open world.
good sauce
I feel better than everyone that has not played Elden Ring.
First game i played to get 100% definetly worth it
Not fun. Hate it. Story makes no sense and gameplay is boring.
Easily the best single player game I've ever played - by a large margin. 
I can't really tell anything new that hasn't already been told 100 times by critics and players alike.
Everything about this game is outstanding, the world building, the aesthetics, the combat, exploration. You can get lost in this big and immersive world with a new adventure around every corner - each of which is worth exploring. 
How you want to play the game is completely in your own hands, there's a vast number of different options to alter the game towards your preference. 
I don't know why I've waited so long until I first picked the game up, but I can tell you that I am glad I finally did! If you give the game a chance and the time to get into it, I'm pretty sure you will not regret it!

so much exploring
Malenia who? killed her 4th try so bad. dlc better be harder
5 stars a bowl fell on my head while i was playing this game
This game is so hard, but every death feels fair. I gave up at Maliketh, when the game first came out, and going back and finishing the game feels like such an accomplishment. And the Lore... The lore is insanely compelling. Highly recommend.
Horrible 60fps screen-tearing gray-green turd. Utter trash unworthy of any money.

A red haired girl sliced me into pieces without my consent. Would recomend
It's a good souls game, but there are some experience-breaking issues. First of all - technical issues. 2.5 years since release and freezing and stuttering due to shader cache or whatever weren't resolved, no matter what rig you have (mine is 5800x3d+4080+48Gb Ram). Now about gameplay itself - good old souls mechanics, lot's of different enemies and bosses - those are positive moments. Completely unneeded open world, overwhelmig count of ashes of war (weapon perks) and spells, while most of it are too weak or completely useless. Also too many story characteres with crossing storylines compared to previous games, honestly, i wasn't able to track their stories progression and complete them all. In conclusion i would recommend this game only to dark souls fans, not for average gamer.

Best of souls game
A challenging game certainly, but one of the mot enjoyable works of war of the last times, its truly beautiful in all levels of design and art besides the massive amount of intriguing lore spread across the lands between

It good.
Elden Ring and I had a bad start, I bought it for full price and felt like I was going to bang my head against the wall for five hours straight. But it was a beautiful wall and I wouldn't except any sunken cost, so I head bashed along. Finally the wall started to crumble. I got a better weapon, Margit fell, and I was sucked into one of the most immersive worlds I have experienced as a gamer. Returning to the lands between feels strangely like home, even though there are still plenty of secrets to be found.

[h1]Game of the Decade[/h1]

Elden Ring may very well be the best video game of this decade, boasting unparalleled world-building. With the upcoming DLC set to further enrich the already immersive world created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, my only suggestion for improvement is to make NPC storylines and quests easier to follow. Currently, they are easily missable, often requiring players to consult community guides or wikis to fully experience them.
What a game!

Sick game. Sick music.
kinda mid not much to do
Likely friendship.
first had it on the xbone now on the pc. will sink 1000s of hours into this
Amazing
god tier game
The game is great for players who are looking for a great challenge. And I mean a REALLY, really really really really really really really big challenge. I've requested a refund for this game, as I'm not even close to good enough at gaming to be able to play through a game like this. Also, there is no difficulty selector at all, so there is no way to make the game easier for yourself.
it took very long for the ring to get eldery
I love this game for so many reasons. The open world is so cool, giving the option to new players to be able summon so they can still have a great time. This is 100% one of my favorite games of all time. Now yes, it is a little pricey, but that doesn't stop it from being every penny. Now that they are adding a DLC I am more excited then ever to play this game. SO MUST PLAY FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO GET INTO THE SOULS-LIKE GENRE.

ive played final fantasy 14 for years and i thought i witnessed every fetish imaginable, but then i discovered Ranni
didn't expect weak foe
10/10 game, need I say more? It has lovable female characters, rumps, giant monsters, and most importantly a hand at marriage with the princess of the moon!
Hands-down one of the best single-player games to date. Amazing visuals, lore, storytelling, and it doesn't treat you like a toddler :)
Stunning visuals!  I just began the journey, so not much input to give.
Amazing
is good
pretty good game if i do say so myself, thanks miyazaki
yea
Best souls game
First souls game I played. Very fun. Am considering playing the others after the DLC.
This game is and will continue to be one of my all time favorites!!!!!!
Game doesn't even support Ultra Wide lmao
Epic!
easy game

One of the Best games Ive ever played...
I died a lot
Try Finger
TL;DR: Yes, I recommend Elden Ring. It's been the best game available for the last two years and will likely remain so for a long time. Whether at full price or half, it's worth every penny.


Elden Ring has been successful, but I‚Äôd never call it a masterpiece. To me, personally, it was a downgrade to the Souls formula of level design that has been working just fine for all these years. Also, if not for the basic Souls formula, there wouldn‚Äôt have been Elden Ring at all. I‚Äôve played all the Souls games to the point where I can do no-damage boss fights comfortably and speedruns just for fun. I‚Äôve spent a ridiculous amount of time grinding Souls games since Demon‚Äôs Souls, and I‚Äôd like to share some thoughts.

Elden Ring has simply fallen into the trap of open-world appeal to the masses, the cursed Ubisoft formula (big map, fog of war you unlock by activating towers, etc. ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure you recognize this trope as it‚Äôs become a meme in gaming). I don‚Äôt know if we can all agree on this, but I‚Äôll say it: Elden Ring is just an open-world Souls game. It has separate lore, for sure, but it has the same old Dark Souls gameplay and tone with some tweaks here and there. 

There‚Äôs this ingenious craftiness in level design that we find in older games, such as old Resident Evil/Silent Hill games, older Dark Souls, etc. They are small in size with limited maps, but that‚Äôs the whole point to get this craftiness I‚Äôm talking about. Remember that first locked door you encounter when you start a game? That ladder you can‚Äôt reach? That cliff that looks like it leads somewhere but you‚Äôre not sure if you want to jump? Traps and world interaction, even through a mere text or simple NPC dialogue, easily missable items/events that play a crucial role in game progression‚Äîthese small details, when put together, give you the complete picture. This interconnection between several stages is what made Dark Souls so good in terms of brilliant level design.

Now, open world kills this aspect and makes you want more. More places, more scenery, more enemies‚Äîyou always want more exposure to new stuff to uncover, and sadly, the game can only offer so much because of limited resources. So, even if the game is huge, you get a big presentation every time you visit a new area, but then you begin to notice the laziness and shortcomings of those landscapes, especially when they‚Äôre bloated with the same enemy types and copy-pasted patterns of dungeons, progression, and boss fights.

Honestly, to me at least, the whole appeal of Souls games revolves around gameplay. Despite being clunky at times and deliberately made to feel constantly oppressed by enemies and bosses, Souls games or Elden Ring have solid and well-thought gameplay with consistent frame data, and it‚Äôs one of those games you can master with enough time and practice. I also believe that the adventure aspect or huge landscapes, be it open world or not, have very little to no impact on me enjoying the game.

Other aspects I like are the boss fights and encounters with ruthless enemies. Your ability to find solutions to overcome said obstacles, whether by outplaying them through sheer skill, finding workarounds, or simply grinding for more levels and better gear to brute-force your way with stronger stats. All of these features can be achieved in a much smaller game where you don‚Äôt even need a map, just like the old Souls games.

Like I said in the beginning, FromSoft wanted to hop on the bandwagon of open-world games and appeal to more people. They‚Äôve been studying the market after all and want to sell. They‚Äôre slowly shifting from the kind of arcade-like mindset that‚Äôs gameplay hyper-focused to a somewhat realistic game design, with slower movement, clunkier recovery animations, bigger world that offers multiple choices to find solutions which translates to less skill required, thus less difficulty. I see where they‚Äôre coming from, but to be honest, I‚Äôm not a fan. Because for all this time, I‚Äôve always regarded Japanese developers as those who prioritize gameplay over everything else. If you‚Äôve been playing their games for a long time and compare them to Western developers, you can notice the difference in philosophy when making games. But now I can see them walking similar paths.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I still believe Elden Ring‚Äôs gameplay is good; they didn‚Äôt change the core radically, but I think that‚Äôs coming and is inevitable.

Again, to me, Elden Ring isn‚Äôt a masterpiece. It‚Äôs a decent Souls game that shone in a time when all other games were bad; it was the only decent choice. It was actually guilty of similar things made by many mainstream games but used a slightly different approach. That slight difference isn‚Äôt novel, mind you‚Äîit‚Äôs always been there. It was none other than the Dark Souls gameplay formula.
got good; good game
gud game

Perfect
I LOVE WII SPORTS THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME <3
Good.
I like mohglester
So much variety in builds, makes the game very replayable. Literal masterpiece of a game

Noice!
GREAT SOULS GAME CANT WAIT FOR DLC
best game ive ever experienced
This game is a masterpiece of its class would recommend to anyone looking for not only a challenge but a world rich with lore not only in its story telling but in environment and game play.
Over 2 years and 500+ hours later.... and I'm still maidenless
Since this game is popular, worth to play
Good Soulsborne game. Not my favorite (that might be Dark Souls 1 or 2) but still extremely fun game.
shits big
Its a little unbalanced, but its still pretty fun
god, O god!
Over 300 hours and that was before i heard about the dlc announce.
loved it on ps5 but its not very optimised for pc
TREE
This is one of the best games ever created. I've played so many new characters and even tried speed running this game. Do yourself the favor and buy it.

top shit
almost punched my dog
It's even better than you imagined
W story and boss fights.
I must say, Miasaki put forward some good work on the detail of Ms.Rannis feet. Good lord I can imagine the stench pouring off, burning the hair off of my eyebrows as i bow to her. 10/10 would smell again

This is one of my favorite games of all time. I have played it countless times and every time I played it i loved it more and more. I would recommend the game for sure 10/10. I am an elden ring glazer.
Naked ginger girl stole my soul. 10/10
fightn is cool . .

Good game, even better with mods. I got the Vergil (with physics) mod and Yamato with Carian Combo Warriors mods, decided to call it Tarnished Mat Cry: Vergil's Rise       XD
its aight
elden ring very good
Good game
One of my favorite games!
This game wants me to kill myself I'm going to love the DLC
Praise, oh mighty dog. for shall thy grant me grace and lore
good but DS3 is king
10/10
Frustration ahead. 
Madness ahead. 
Overwhelming enjoyment ahead.
Try attacking.
amazing. a must play 10/10!!
I bought this game because I heard it was like Skyrim. If you‚Äôre reading this because you heard the same. I‚Äôm here to inform you that information is very much false. You can‚Äôt compare the two games. It‚Äôs like comparing a fork and a spoon. This game has no chill. You are thrusted straight into a hostile world where the combat will either make you or break you. There‚Äôs no in-between; you‚Äôll either love this game or hate it. The game is beautiful visually. It runs extremely smooth without ever experiencing any fps drops. There are quest, but there‚Äôs no quest log. The world is big and full of unexpected dangers. You need to optimize your character build from the start of the game, otherwise you‚Äôre going to be having a rough time later. I recommend this game for my fellow gamers who still love a challenge. If you‚Äôre the type who likes to play casually & prefer being spoon-fed; this game is not for you.
Probably 1 of the best games ever made! <3 <3 <3
Phenomenal game - classic Souls difficulty in a massive open world
fun game og souls games are better dark souls 2 pvp is the best suck it dks2 haters

Game sucks and I hated it. Would 10/10 Not recommend to a friend or even an enemy.
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!!! YOU WILL SPEND THOUSAND OF HOURS INTO THIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS MORE ADDICTING THEN CRACK (i would know)
ranni promised to give me a honda accord
I'd swipe right on Marika
rhe greatest game ever
GREAT STORY
I never intended to play through this game because I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. It ended up being one of my favorite games to date. Such a great story and with the mechanics developed by other souls games over time, it plays great. I've compared the experience like playing The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the first time. There's so much to explore and after finishing up my 2nd playthrough, I'm finding things that I completely missed on the first pass. If you aren't into soulslike games like I was, I'd implore you to give this one a shot. It's so much more than a "soulslike" to me.

A great time to get into it too -- I can't wait for the expansion!
mhm
Nem sei o que falar, o Miyazaki √© um g√™nio. Recomendo demais!!!
This game is one of my favourites of all time, probably up there with Zelda Ocarina of Time and Kena Bridge of Spirits. But this is not a 10/10 game for me. 8.5/10.
The music, graphics and open world map design is impeccable and it's still the most beautiful game I've ever seen.
However, the story telling is incredibly lacking and the way in which you are expected to progress is explained very vaguely in game.
The voice acting performances are top tier and character design is amazing; that is, if you even manage to find the NPCs and follow some very odd lines of enquiry to navigate their quests.
I love hidden lore as much as the next fantasy RPG girlie, and EldenWiki is a godsend but the work you have to put in will not be to everyone's taste.
My favourite flawed game.
Probably one of the best video games ever created by man. I think that should be enough for the review. Dont hesitate, get it right away. The best of From Software put into one.
It's ok to die
Dark Souls is like a boot camp for gamers, designed to break you down and build you up stronger. It's infuriating, hilarious, and oddly satisfying. Prepare to die. A lot. And maybe, just maybe, enjoy every minute of it.
This is the best game I've ever played! Tbh this is the first soulsbourne game i have ever played, but i haven't gotten bored even though I have over 100 hours
yes the elden of rings another fromsoft masterpiece
Best game of all time
the dlc hasnt come out yet but its game of the year
badass.
best game ever your gonna hate it but you cant leave it
Best soulsborne imo. would recommend to everyone
fck patches
this game is hard as fuck but it is so fun
Malenia can sit on me 10/10
if you want to get lost in hours upon hours of a dark fantasy, beautiful landscapes, intense boss battles and just down right fun. this is the game for you
My first proper souls game. I played a bit of Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro but never got into. Have played through to the end multiple times but never finished it. Amazing game with insane lore and i strongly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about getting the game. It is not as hard as the other souls games in my opinion and there are so many different ways to play the game.

10/10
easiest game ive ever played and i finally got a girlfriend in it so thats awesome sauce! would recommended 3/10 stars
This game is a 10/10, just wish it worked on mac/parallels.
THE BEST OF THE BEST.
The Goat.
I wish Wormfaces were real so i could kiss them

Best game that I have ever played and it makes you want to get all of the endings. Fromsoftware knocked this out of the park.

This game is cool check it out
Amazing game, nothing to add that wasn't said before.
GOAT game
i haven't written a review???? It saved freedom of speech. Elon Musk beat the game, Then made an offer to buy twitter..... Play the game dumb-ass it's that good. why are you still reading this comment.
10/10 Marika's tits this shit bussin
Elderly Bingus is best game. Cant wait for the DLC, Darkness of ze Ed, Edd n Eddytree
So much fun that I almost didn't enjoy it
Quite an amazing world that this game is built in. The art is spectacular and you should stop every now and again strictly be amazed by the environments. I will be honest in saying that the story is quite lacking, about on the same end as the dialogue from important NPCs. Bosses that you would imagine to have such intricate stories just say briefly they you are either a fly on the wall, are interrupting them, or say, "Wow look how far you've come," and proceed to attack you without must reason. I know the type of game that this is, but there is LITERALLY no room for negotiation and therefore many of the boss fights have an emptiness to them. That's just my opinion as someone who has played all other souls games. Many others as similar in this. I still recommend this game, it's fantastic overall. - roughly 7.5/10
I hate it but its too addicting

praise the message!

It is a very fun game and you can take only a few hours or you can take 30 hours to beat the game. It has so much to offer and I can't wait for the DLC to come out.
I am still searching for John Eldenring, but great game anyways!
[h3]For me the game is 10/10[/h3]
The game plot is messy but very interesting.
The opponents are demanding.
[spoiler](for me MALIKETH, THE BLACK BLADE was the most)[/spoiler]
I love games where nothing comes easy, where you have to fight for every progress in the story.
Now I'm waiting for the DLC.

Souls-like executed flawlessly, 10/10.
Nah, I'll win
masterpiece.
truly masterpiece
I've played Dark Souls 1,2 and 3 and finished all of them multiple times, played Bloodborne and liked ir (didnt love it because i lost my ps4) and Sekiro is a game on my wishlist. 
All this to say I was hoping Elder Ring was going to be one of those games where I beat every boss, try a bunch of weapons and most important play with friends.
At the time I had a bunch of problems with connections, the fact that summons leave after each and every boss in a open world game reminds me of games from 30 years ago, every game usually needs a guide but this time is more a guide that needs a game on the second screen. Theres a slight slight way nudge in terms on directions but even that's too much, I'm all for game that don't hold your hand, but there's fathers that support you and fathers that just don't give a flying fuck what you do.
And its hard for me to say but it might be the worse 60 euros I spent in my life, and I bought Cyperpunk on release, but that at least had the makings of a good game this one feels like a tech demo that was over hyped and just over jerked from the fan base.

i suck but it is fun<3
Tbh 10/10 game
EZ game but still fun
late review so doubt Ill be the one to convince anyone to buy this game or its dlc but I swear it is worth playing as is any fromsoftware game
ÿÆÿßŸäÿ≥ÿ©
yeah

jogo muito bom, recomendo, principalmente sabendo que o primeiro boss do jogo √© o Marco Hor√°cio, criador do famoso livro Franklin a Tartaruga
Game has nice graphics/soundtrack and that is about it. 

Fake open world after first 2 zones. Everything will look like a corridor with all the huge mountains, broken bridges and huge holes rendering the whole "amazing open world" ridiculous. Mouse and keyboard settings are awful, so dont play this game unless you are willing to use controller. Boss fights start nice and they get worse and worse design wise the further in the game you make it. Delayed attacks so delayed the animation starts looking ridiculous. Huge buffer queue for pressed keys for no reason. Camera zoomed in so much, that melee character cant see more than half of the boss at any given time. Copy pasted content - bosses, buildings etc. 

solid 4/10 PC game and 8/10 console game.
Liked since day 1 till the end.
Greatest Action RPG of all time.
god

elden, duh
good game
yo this shit was tight af. so ez

I did not find this game on my own and never even really played it until recently, over all I have over 200 hours total across platforms. I absolutely love this game and look forward to playing it everyday. Graphics are great, so are controls and the story line really gives me a reason to keep playing. I am greatly looking forward to the DLC release at the end of this month.
Game of a lifetime.
To start this is my first Fromsoftware game and I never played any Dark souls or Sekiro. This game is amazing even for a beginner as me, I completed the game in around 50 hours and 20 hours played just exploring the world before the first boss. The open world aspect really is the star of the show as it makes you able to kill other optional bosses or skip story bosses if they are to hard. It makes you able to gear up and come back to get revenge against the boss that broke your keyboard. I think this game is the perfect amount of challenging and would recommend this game to any "Normie" gamer even if they are not used to the Fromsoftwere games.
Best Game
Unequivocal masterpiece.

It's preeeetty good.
Sure, its extremely frustrating and hard. But once you accept that, enjoy how large and visually impressive this game truly is. Its crazy how much there is in this game to explore and try out.
great game!
One of the best games i've played
The game is boring ngl
Find the Albinauric woman. She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia. She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.
This is the best fromsoft game to date. i've played all of their games except for demons souls to date and i can say that when they tell you they learn from every game they make they are telling the truth.
Best game ever made. Period.
Horse
If you're a fan of Dark Souls or other games when you die all the time then this game is for you. I personally cant pass a single boss even at the very beginning. Asked for a refund.

Simply amazing. Every time I think the game has shown me the most amazing stuff, there is more. The depth of the world building is insane. Plus fun combat, plus cool characters. 
Plus it looks amazing and runs smoothly, even on my 10 year old Gtx 1080. Props to the devs
Simply the best game ever created
game is good because good in game
Hugs are bad
best of the best
this game makes me mad
indeed a good game
Very rich and compelling in terms of gameplay, story and game design. 
And the open world, the choices of what you want to do next are seemingly vast. At times to a painful extent if you do not pay attention to what is being told and hinted at . 

The main questline is pretty straightforward, although the smaller, individual questlines can suffer from being too unlinear and open in terms of continuation. This at times results in doing a quest for someone, in which they thereafter change location to a seemingly hard to guess spot.
I admit that I had to sometimes use a guide to find the continuation of the questline, or a specific item. Only to find one or the other at a location that just managed to baffle me. "How the hell was I supposed to find this / you?" was a sentiment I shared a couple of times.

But the story and the tellings of the sorrounding lore are EXPERTLY written. And they are not spoonfed in the slightest, which is a welcome change of pace in terms of storytelling.
This also means you will not have a grasp on everything in your first playthrough. But in this case this type of storytelling complements the game immensely and adds in replayability.
I cannot say much more than that the story is in the same vein as Tolkien's work, and the delivery method is almost biblical in its scale and telling. Reviewing something like this is way above my ability.

The world itself is not what I would call massive in size, but the amount of locations, undergrounds, points of interests and other things is astounding. I thoroughly enjoyed just exploring and finding things out.

Other than that?
A fair share of the caves and dungeons in the game share similar layouts which at times make them seem like rehashes, aswell as some "bosses"
But that did not bother me personally during my first time playthrough.

The scenery and the world is very pretty. Pretty with vibrant colours, differing atmospheres and landscapes.
Something I enjoy dearly.

The lack of a journal or anything much similar to keep track of things is welcomed and changes the landscape and the way one is playing. The game could make you think it expected you to have an actual journal beside you to write in at times.

I also fucking love Wondorous Physick and Erdtree avatars.

9.5/10
mmmmmmmm elden ring
pretty good
good
Best!!
Once you understand that there is a whole ass map and not just the story progression, it gets fire.
Boy oh boy where do I even start, Dear Dark Souls 1 you genuinely the most beautiful amazing handsome intelligent game on this earth
absolute masterpiece. nothing more needs to be said.
Magical
good
gg
fun
I don't think there are any words to describe this masterpiece of a game.

In my eyes this is truly Miyazaki's greatest work. From the story telling and the mechanics, to the underlying impact your choices can have on the world. This game truly has it all.

As a souls game, eldern ring does exactly what can be expected of it. It challenges you to keep fighting that certain boss or level. "If I just learn those patterns" or "Oh no, I was so close!" are sentences which I believe you'll hear/experience a lot. But that is the beauty of these games. You keep and keep going, and in the end. You're left with an amazing experience.
Skibidi Biden! This game is awsome!!!
Most beginner friendly souls game ever made. The open world made it really easy to approach any difficulty or bosses. Waiting for the dlc.
get gud

Elden Ring is a game changer, seriously. It's like Dark Souls but on steroids. The world is massive and full of surprises. The combat? Brutal but fun. It's tough, but that's part of the charm. You'll get lost exploring, but trust me, it's worth it. This game is a must-play. Easily a 10/10
I HATE THE BLOODHOUND KNIGHT DARRIWILL, it took me like 30 attempts and afterwards  i felt a rush of adrenaline, the whole game is like this. if you are a easy to give up person, no elden ring to you man.
10/10 must play
Nice.
Truly a masterpiece.
Amazing and vast world crafting, 5 out 5 game
The only single player game that i can keep playing 10/10

Great game with huge story and map. It's super hard, but you can make the game easier through spirit ashes and other things.
A once in a generation game. Not perfect, but no other piece of media has given me the sense of wonder and amazement Elden Ring did EVERY TIME I stepped into a new area. It's phenomenal.
Fuck this game it's so hard and annoying at times. 10/10 would play 24/7
GOTY baby
Amazing game!!!!!!!!
Everyone should be aware that this game uses a [b] KERNEL LEVEL ANTI CHEAT [/b] (it doesn't even prevent against cheating and should be removed altogether) Furthermore, EAC kills performance and meddles with the networking.

If you want to play this game, you need a way to bypass the anti-cheat for your own enjoyment and safety, always play offline with EAC disabled.
Best gameplay of all time
souls games are for donkeys
First souls game and its very good and challenging at the same time.
Just top notch FromSoft. As per usual.
So nice, I bought it twice.
best game out
very fun but hard
banger of a game
Praise the review
Beware of rage
10/10
8/10 for the gameplay, the other 2/10 is discovered by reading item descriptions. However its a 10/10 when modded with boobs
Luh freaky certified my johnson grew 3 inches and she still left me after she caught me beating my shit to melenia but hey it was all worth it and now i sold my kids to afford the dlc imma kill myself now
Its decend
THIS GAME IS CANCER AND I HATE IT. i cant stop playing and the graphics are gorgeous but the game is very good ii love it but the movement and camera with combat takes some time to get used to
by far my favorite game. im not very good at gaming, so i have to play offline so i can godmode so i can experience the full game. so i cant really speak on the multiplayer part but this is still my favorite in terms of offline mode, story, music and graphics. thank you devs for a great game. sorry for godmoding, im not a very skilled player...its just my truth.
for what its worth, i still highly recommend this game.
Too many ladders
Ranni the Witch is the reason why I played this. No regrets at all.
Eu acredito nos esp√≠ritos :)
Â•ΩÁé©ÔºåÁà±Áé©
Great game, be ready to die but worth it.
seems cool i guess
One of the greatest games ever made so far.

Positives:
- A true open-world exploration game where you go where you wanna go, see that cool thing over there? let's go there! who knows what you might find.
- Challenging and fair enemy encounters (for the most part) where you have to pay attention to you every move in order to win.
- So many weapons, armors and playing styles that it feels like there is a near endless amount of builds you can play around with.
- A long adventure that isn't filled with repetitive copy and paste side-quests that feels like a to-do list.
- Respects your time and intelligence.
- Great characters and NPC stories.
- Bosses wont just stand there and let you heal like some moron.
- Bosses combos are made up of attacks that can be interchanged with each other, which makes it so you cant just remember the string of attacks in a combo, you have to instead truly look at what they are doing next to properly avoid their attacks.
- Some of the best level-design Fromsoft has ever made (especially the legacy dungeons), the biggest reason why IMO is thanks to the dedicated jump button which adds so many more possibilities in what Fromsoft could do with the level-design.

Negatives:
- Horse combat sucks.
- Dragons are a major letdown compared to what we got before in DS3 with Midir. Only dragons worth fighting are Lichdragon Fortissax and Dragonlord Placidusax.
- Crafting is kinda boring and wasn't as mandatory for your survival as i had hoped it would be.
- Some bigger bosses (Fire Giant, Tree Spirits, ect.) have attacks that are fully off-screen which makes it near impossible to react to the animation of the attack, which forces you to completely rely on your muscle memory of the timing of the attack, which isn't skill-based since it cant be done unless you have seen the attack multiple times before.
- Some steps in NPC-questlines can be very hard to find/understand.
- Repeat mini bosses can be a bit of a letdown sometimes.

Conclusion:
While it's not flawless, it is truly a masterpiece of a game that other developers should learn a thing or two from.
10/10 one of my favorite games ever played.
ok
yes
Super good
Watch a video for runes farming. Just push through, you will DIE in 1 shot, just push through. Gain runes and lvl up, and then MAKE YOUR JUDGEMENT. (after 10+ hours)
the first ring type game
IM GONNA BUST OMG AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
yo
at first, it is hard because you don't what to do or where to go. but after you play this game long enough, you'll know what is your purpose, and it's really fun! if your favorite type of game is adventurous, rpg, and fantasy, this game is perfect for you.
One of the greatest games I've ever played. Yes, it's easier than Dark Souls but it's more challenging than most games.
ahh hole....
time for rushing in
I don't even need to say anything really. 

Literally one of the best fictional worlds ever created.

10/10 art team go brrrrrr.
The first game that actually made me rage. I am not that type at all, but learning the moveset of the enemy, leveling up, and sometimes know when to leave and come back later makes it so much more worth when I actually DO progress. Stunning view. And I love the little notes that are left in the world from other players.
Must play for Dark Souls players or new players that would like to get in soulslike games
Far I've traveled
Many services I sought
Tarnished thee once was
now reviewing as lord. 
The ring is a frenzied addiction

learning curve for newer players but this game is a 10/10
I slash
I roll
I did it all before
After playing MMORPGs for about 20 years, I had absolutely grown tired of them. The games started to feel more like a job than a form of entertainment, and I lost all hope. 

I have such an unusual taste in games: I enjoy creating my own builds, having the option for PvP, and sometimes I just want to jump in and do whatever I feel like on certain days.

I was recommended open-world games, but they never captured my interest. They were fun for about 30 minutes, and then I would find myself looking for something else.

This game is the best game I have ever played.

I can play for an hour and have fun when I don't have much time, and I can play for five hours when I do.

I never feel like I have to play it as if it were a job.

Even though this is my first soulslike game, it has opened my eyes to this genre.

10/10 without a doubt.
liar ahead
FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL.... BEAR WITNESS!!!!

youre going to suffer but youre going to be happy about it
Fun game and the feeling of beating a boss you have been struggling on for a long time is amazing! Might stutter every now and then but doesn't really cause problems as the time it has happened to me have been in the open world. Playing through it again and still am having a ton of fun! 
Excited for Shadow of the erdtree
best game i ever played. not much of a pvp fan but other than that it's perfect for people with strong hearts
screw the elden ring, i dont want to be the elden lord anymore, oh greater will please hear my pleas
seek purchase.
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Emboldened by the flame, of ambition
a masterpiece
Spirit summons are so fun lol Lhutel the headless running down the boss is never not funny
Yeah safe to say, its pretty damn good.

BEST GAME EVER
Personally, the game is fun to play. I honestly didn't care much for the story but as far as game play, atmosphere, and combat. With so much available out there to do in Elden Ring (with DLC on the way) Its content is vast and for at the core I feel like that's what a game should have. If im throwing 70 dollars at a game and its completed in less than an hour due to lack of content. Its just a delaying experience. Even though I've got all the achievements, there's still a mass amount of unexplored areas that I probably haven't seen yet.
good game
Best game, like a 1000 page book with paintings spread throughout and life in every word.
asaaaaaaaaa
I keep dying and it keeps getting more fun to.
You will get addicted.
very challenging and def not for casual gamers but if you like soulsborne games then you will def love this one
I get to see Rennala feet 10/10
Fun with friends
no sex
10/10 if they improve the start for beginners!
Amazing.
great game
skibidi
best game ever
The camera is nauseating, the lock on system poor, the ui is atrocious, and the controls have an awkward amount of input delay combined with buffering issues (why do I raise my shield to block when I took my finger off the block button 2 seconds ago?) that increase difficulty artificially. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these issues were PC related because I don't remember things being nearly this bad in previous Dark Souls titles when I played on Xbox. Additionally, boss fights can be fun and challenging but the time between bosses is a chore. If you look up guides you realize that most recommend just running past the majority of enemies in the game because actually fighting them all and engaging with the level design is an arduous chore that cumulatively consumes hours and hours with little to no reward or purpose. 

Finally, and this is more of a personal gripe than I think a universally shared sentiment, I am tired the developer insisting on a lack of QOL changes. Why don't shortcuts reset after I die so that I have to call the elevator back to the floor on which I respawn? If you run out of arrows, getting more is easy but you will have to spend 5 minutes getting the points to buy more arrows, going to the vendor to purchase them, and then returning to the spot where you were when you needed the arrows in the first place. Just let me spawn with arrows after I die. Why is there no questlog so I can at least remember what is going on and have a general idea of what I should do if I want to progress a character's story? People defend this game saying these aspects are part of its charm, but whatever charm these aspects brought to the game faded quickly for me. The game insists on wasting players' time and keeping them in the dark and at this point in my life, with limited time, I really can't recommend a game where you can look back on a gaming session and genuinely feel you have accomplished nothing, not because you didn't try, but because the game, by design, stifles progress through its opacity.
No maidens?
One of the easier entry from the famous FromSoft, though don't let that mean easier to play, its still very much a Souls game in its core, but hurdles and routes to pursue the next milestone is ultimately up to you. Its its first Open World game, mechanics and UI is easy to understand.

The story is told to you as a living environment, where you'll collect details of the lore via dialogue and item description and enemy engagement. If you want to feel like a nameless hero of yor in a grand adventure within a lost world, you'll not be disappointed.

If you find yourself enjoying Elden Ring, definitely check the Soul series as a rite of passage.
My favorite game of all time, 11/10.
Gem hay vaxi lof
good game
Easiest game I've ever played.
Hard as shit. But fun

Its just a good soulsborne game, i love the fact that its open world and you can come back to a boss later instead of having to bare through like the other games.
yes.
Good game, would play again.

AMAZINGGGGGG
it just loves to waste your time

amazing game beautiful art and combat !
nice
Amazing

An outrageous joyride. Buy the ticket
So many issues plague this game, yet it is one of the most beautiful piece of art I've experienced.
It's Alright
Please add native ultrawide support.
My flesh was in fact consumed by the scarlet rot.
You're final challenge... let you maiden stroke yo bone.

 Awh hell yeah elden lord, you the goat!
great game
i keep trying to tickle radahn's taint but he wont let me.
pretty cool
Tough but fair.
Its sad that fromsoft is using 3rd party Kernel level anti-cheat.  It doesnt stop cheaters, it just collects your data for hackers to have.  ds3 had better anti cheat and it wasnt intrusive
yes
elden ring
This is a beast of a game! If you've played any of the Dark Souls games, you know what to expect. The world and aesthetic is phenomenal. Play the base game, and then play it again with the seamless coop mod. Can't wait for the expansion!
Fantastic game, perfectly challenging only slight problem is that the flask seems to activate at the wrong time when I click it during stun
Best game ever? Not a stretch to say that, and many would agree.
literally the best game ever made.
It's pretty good!
Nah, I'd Win
w masterpiece
Love the game

Definitely worth checking out!
cool game would recommend
11/10

nerf mimic tear too op
Still haven't beat Margit but the game is really fun
:)
I still don't know what the elden ring is, but the game is pretty cool
was good
o yea
you will never find a better game than this;]
It's great
elden ring.
 best game of all time.
Praise the Sun!
It is the goat.
honestly any game 100% finished at release deserves a plus now-a-days.
The only game ive ever gone out of my way to 100%.
This game brought back the way I was when I first enjoyed video games as a kid; watching walkthroughs, reading guides, exploring and discovering new things on my own, etc, etc.

One of the most rewarding feelings i've ever had playing a video game.

Outstanding.
AMAZING GAME some of the most fun ive had playing a non indi game in years
fun game tbh i nutted
One of the greatest games I've ever played!! 9.8/10!!
Great game with an equally great story. I am looking forward to the DLC when it comes out. If you dislike the Souls game you will not like this game however.
I wrote a review earlier and it didn't go through so here's a quick summary of what I don't like.

In my opinion hard ‚â† fun, and that's this whole games premise, but that's a me thing. The main problem is whenever I finish a hard boss or squad of enemies I didn't feel rewarded at all. In my eyes, this game was made to make you feel bad and barely reward you for anything.
If you haven't yet, Buy it!
recommend to the average Joe
John Elden Ring
game of all time

best game of all time
GGOAT
Masterpiece
Very goo
Great game, but the horse is trash and refuses to do anything right.
game doesnt run after 8 hours of troubleshooting
 The Elden Ring:)
Mr. Zaki cooked once again.
This game infuriates me to no end, leaving me utterly distraught and depressed most days. 

10/10
fun on a bun in the sun, son
it siucks
game gud
Incredible game 10/10 recommend
Overall from someone who is brand new to this game and these types of games--- I have a love hate relationship with it 

- If you love the grind this game will test every bit of it ! But you will learn to love it once you die a million times like me LOL . 10/10 reccomend ! 


It's good.
I hate the fire giant
10/10 will die again.
i like pain
cool
Peak
For as long a game as it is, its still fun to play over and over again.
best game ever
If only I had a pickle...
DEFINITELY. I put Dark Souls down after about 1 hr. of getting my absolute BUTT KICKED.  Never picked up another FS title till this one.  It is still tremendously tough for a novice like me, but super rewarding.

Also, you can tell this game was made with players in mind.  No micro-transactions of ANY kind. 300+hrs. of gameplay.  We need to support studios who put the player first, to help steer the industry AWAY from egregious money-grab and gacha tactics.
great game
Terrible I hated it it was the worst thing I ever played but funny moments
rereererer
good game
Favorite game
endless hours of suffering for the whole family
this game isnt a game at all last i checked a game is supposed to have fun not make you rage and go at something for the next hour(s). only reason why it go GOTY is because of its graphics, artistry scenes, and open world avalibility.
erm.. what the sigma?

I tried to see why this game was Game of the Year of it's time, I just don't see it at all. It's a very boring game and the only thrill and fun part is the bosses and even then dying 100+ times on one boss is just not fun for me. I gave it a fair shot

Edit: I am reinstalling for the fourth time yikes

Edit 2: So I dropped being a Samurai and became a rat Mage, holy shit did the game get a million times easier and it annoys the hell out of me
I love the part where the Elden Beast explodes everywhere on me
great game looks beautiful would recommend this although its hard (the games designed for you to die so you learn)
BONK
greatest game of all time

sword
yes
It very gud.
This game is like the father i never had
tarnished
ghy
might get it again when dlc drops tbh cause the game is fire i just dont wanna spend 90 bucks on it
elden lard
Not bad, I guess
VERY FUN
 A game where you‚Äôre as likely to be slain by the breathtaking views as you are by the actual enemies. It‚Äôs a world so vast, you‚Äôll need a second life just to explore it all. And let‚Äôs not forget the bosses, who are so tough, they make your tax returns look like a walk in the park.

In Elden Ring, you‚Äôll lose more souls than a ghostbuster on overtime, but the thrill of victory? Priceless. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of beauty, brutality, and ‚ÄúWhy did I just walk off that cliff again?‚Äù moments.

So, if you enjoy stunning landscapes, challenging combat, and the occasional existential crisis, Elden Ring is the game for you. Just remember, it‚Äôs not about the destination; it‚Äôs about the countless times you‚Äôll respawn along the way. 10/10 would get defeated by gravity again.
gud fromsoft dark souls
There is no game such as this. Truly a master craft of solid gameplay, exploration and mysteries.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.
psychological torture
What's there not to like
yes but its super f*ucking hard tho
This game is largely great, its amazing.  I have literally spent hundreds of hours in it and I find new things with every new play through.  My experience with it would largely be glowing, if not for what just happened to me.  Which makes me want to tell you I love everything about this game.  However before you play there are some things you need to know.  First you can spend hundreds of hours in the game and not encounter one error.   God help you if you do.  If your game gets "corrupted,"  you lose EVERYTHING.   Have 150+ hours devoted to a slot?  Gone, poof!  What corrupted you?  Who knows but the straight game is more than capable of destroying your experience.   So should you buy this game, well if your willing to take frequent breaks, maintain a saving file system where you copy your own files after you exit then yes I think this game could be a great purchase.  If you don't do this, then no I would't recommend the time investment this  would entail.  If you don't take the time to maintain your own backup system this is what awaits you, a desperate search for 3rd party hacks, editing your own save files, and going through your own file system to try to find a way to backup your game.   Your choice, at least now your informed.
Fun but makes me wanna die
One of the greatest achievements in gaming. Hard, but fair....most of the time. From Software cannot make a bad game. Do yourself a favor and play all of their catalog.
Great game, lots of options, best map I played and its really big. Lots of fun builds
yes
This is the best video game I have ever played.
I hate it
Love it want more
Tough, but rewarding. Basically everything I've been looking for in a game. My first Souls game and it won't be the last.

FromSoft games feel like someone forked Nintendo after Link to the Past and decided not to make games for young kids.

Finger but hole/10
it gud
no maidens + tarnished + touch grace
GOTY
Can't respec stat points from starting class horrible game
I hated this game at first, the open world was intimidating, but trust me, once you get into it, you will not be able to put this game down.
Cool game, it would be nice if they could clean up some bugs tho, there was this one boss who kept repeating one voice line, something about her name, i dont quite remember it tho
this is like an gambling addiction
great
yes i will marry her
Prepare the gaping with a smile
i am maidenless
such an amazing game
GOATED
Good
LOVE ITTTT

seen everybody i liked die in the most agonizing way possible, 10/10
ps: rest in piss gostoc
Had way too much fun on every platform i played this on even at 30 fps definetly one of the best games of all time . however i did have some issues because my processor is kinda lacking and the game doesnt wanna load lately so thats a small downside but i found this game too good for that to deter me from playing (trying to anyways).
elden wing
Easily my all time favorite game.  So much replayability with different classes.

Without looking anything up, expect to play 100 hours on your first playthrough.

Amazing game!
stupid ass game
Fantastic game in terms of content, repeatability and options to the player. It is the best ever souls / souls-like game in terms of customisation options. Graphically and story line wise the game is spot on and the continuity is there so you don't feel totally lost in the story unlike other games.
Its a solid 75 hour 100% achievement game.
The biggest downside is the game is stupidly easy compared to previous titles in the franchise. The ability to obtain a flask very early on that prevents you from ever losing runes is silly. Coming to this game from Sekiro, even not exploiting the flask i found the bosses average at best, even Melania dropped first time.
Hopefully the DLC adds an actual challenge to the game as with a standard quality build you can pretty much walk through the game.
Achievement wise, they were pretty box standard for souls and considering the size of the game, they were reasonably obtainable. I hope the DLC stays on these tracks
Well worth the purchase if you enjoy the franchise

very fun game
buy it bro..?

skill issue
Still not a big fan of having 98% of the story and lore being hidden and not easily discovered but that's just a preference. What is there is good enough to keep you interested in trying to find more. Visual Design and Execution are top tier as to be expected of FromSoftware. Ambiance with the visuals tying in with the music makes it really easy to lose track of time. Outside of the forced to discover most of the story in hidden spots stuff the only real complaint I have is just the lack of options to manipulate the End-User Experience, my eyes hurt from the chromatic aberration, the lack of ability to tweak any UI or Caption visuals to better personalize their readability and the number one complaint - no FOV customization. I imagine its probably to help with how gameplay is designed to be and make the player feel, but being so close in 3rd person seems to make me have similar symptoms to motion sickness so it does kinda suck I can't tweak some of these settings without then having to use mods and going thru that whole mess to get a mod for FOV or UI to get around dumb anticheat software, too much of a headache to deal with for me to do, so it just would be cool if the game just let you. All in all, I'd recommend the game, just hope the developer allows some bit of freedom in customization of settings later down the road, or you know the stupid anticheat stuff is dropped that we all know doesn't work anyway but companies still keep shoving in there.

I want to start off by clarifying this is not my favorite genre. I find most solo character action-RPGs to be lonely affairs, I much prefer the Mass Effects and Baldur's Gate style campaigns that focus on party characters. With that said, Elden Ring's beautiful world is loaded with incredible environments, intimidating foes, and an endless sense of wonder and exploration. The action is fluid, engaging, and varied.

I enjoyed this game primarily with heavy use of the wikipedia and tutorials. I honestly feel like that is how the game is designed to be used; it is much more fun for me to have a target artifact I want to recover from some deep catacomb, some area I missed on my own that I have to carefully backtrack and find what I missed. 

I also played through most of the game with the Seamless Co-Op mod, which changes multiplayer from limited to asking for assistance only in boss areas to making the entire game something you can explore with a friend. I much preferred this style, although it does have the downside of disconnecting you from the amusing and frequently helpful messages left for you by other players. 

All this to say - this game is a masterpiece. Even if it's not your usual cup of tea, I encourage you to try it out.  If you find it lonely, try the co-op mod. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to google a guide or watch a video on a cool build you could try. The game is worth the journey.
if you think this game is bad then you are a poopy pants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Shadow bathes in light and knows weakness"
Elden Ring is a captivating game that offers an immersive and challenging experience. It's a game that will take you through a roller coaster of emotions. You'll feel anger as you face its toughest challenges, exhilaration when you finally overcome them, and sorrow for the mountains of experience points you lose along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived.

The game is set in the "Lands Between" and you play as a "Tarnished" of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. The grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there‚Äôs no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours.

The open-world exploration and crafting mechanics have clearly been inspired by Nintendo‚Äôs Breath of the Wild¬≤. The game is very similar to previous Dark Souls games, but with an open-world format like Skyrim. The game's world is vast and full of things to discover. The combat is rewarding and punishing, and there's more content than most players will ever need.

However, the game's high difficulty means it may not be suitable for more casual gamers. Some fights are very difficult, and the final stretch of the game makes the first 100 hours look like a vacation. Most Souls games end with a punishing boss, or at worst two. But Elden Ring ends with four.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that offers a rich and rewarding gaming experience. It's a game that will test your skills and patience, but also reward you with a sense of accomplishment and awe. It's a game that's worth every hour spent playing it.

10/10 awesome sauce
this is hands down the best game I have ever played
head ahead
BEst of all time

Esse jogo √© isso tudo mesmo ta que pariu
epic
Shut the fuck up you maggot. You clearly don't understand what makes a great video game. Elden Ring is a beautifully crafted masterpiece with a rich-open, beautiful graphics, fantastical gameplay, a great narrative, great quest design and it gives a ton of freedom and an actual challenge. Meanwhile all the other games that came out this year are overrated, mediocre games with boring, generic and repetitive gameplay, boring and uninteresting narratives and keep telling you what to do every 5 seconds. You and the people that support these kinds of doghit games are everything that is wrong this the gaming industry. These companies give you garbage and you guys eat it up and ask for more. Elden Ring is literally the only game that deserves to be called a true video game. Everything else is a joke and a scam. So fuck you, fuck all the people that pay for it, and fuck these companies that keep pumping these shitty mediocre kiddy games. I hope all of you fuckers die. Elden Ring and FromSoftware deserve all the praise and much more. They are single-handedly carrying the entire gaming industry with their state of the art games.
The perfect game.

Very overrated, its very hard to know where to go or what to do. If it only was some sort of mission menu like in games like breath of the wild, this would be so much better and a lot more enjoyable if you would know where to go.

Buying Elden Ring is much more worth it than buying "DLC from COD Modern Warfare" believe me.
sexy game
Pretty good
i wish i could play it for the first time on more time
Like crack

makes you hate yourself tho

This was my introduction into the Souls games and let me tell ya, it's amazing. I made the mistake of getting super frustrated at the bosses more times than I care to admit. That being said, do your best to go into it with the mindset of learning the moves/mechanics of the game/bosses. Persevere and you will be rewarded with hands down one of the best games of the last ten years. From the intricate story to the stunning open world, there is so much to do and appreciate in this game.

Almost 150 hours in and I still have not found every item or weapon, nor every boss. If you are into Souls games, you will fall in love with this one. Just remember to go into it with a mindset of learning and adapting, and you will have the time of your life. Even if you haven't played a Souls or Souls-like game before, I still HIGHLY recommend you give it a try, you won't regret it.

10/10
best game
this has got to be one of the best games i've ever played. as soon as i beat it, i started a ng+ for another ending and beat that within 24 hours just out of pure enjoyment for the game. the scope of this game and how immersive it is still blows my mind. highly recommend this to any type of player even if you are new to fromsoftware games. just make sure to stick through the struggles and failure will inevitably become success if you keep trying

buy the game if you want all the smoke and girls
oh fr
Finally finished my first journey after a long hiatus, now I sit ever so impatiently waiting for the DLC haha

Elden Ring is everything I love about From's games and so much more. The sheer amount and depth of content dwarfs any other title by a large margin. 

My favorite part of the game, especially nearing mid/late game, is how resourceful the game encourages you to be as the difficulty ramps up. It heavily rewards you for being flexible with your build and finding new tools/gear to help you overcome challenges in a way I've never seen in a Souls-Like before, and I LOVE IT.

If I wasn't so busy for the next week or so, I would have already started NG+. This game is so fun I cannot wait for Shadow of the Erdtree :D
Truly the best RPG I've ever played as someone who has never played a FromSoftware game before it was definitely a steep learning curve but so so rewarding

Every area is so detailed and visually striking with such unique enemies, weapons and items that it's easy to get lost in it for hours

I wish I could play it for the first time again it's truly magnificent
They call me 007 -

There's honestly not much I could say about Elden ring that hasn't been said by just about anyone who's played the game, It's a masterpiece. The open world is huge but also dense with things to find and fight. 

They have taken every good mechanic from their previous games and they have made a true gem of a game. 10/10
Every enemy in this game has this really weird and annoying windup, where they'll start their attack, hold the animation for like 2-6 seconds, and then let out the attack in like 2 frames. it's more like a test of attention span rather than skill, because they hold it for so long i literally get distracted by my other monitor before it even comes out. especially Margit. he has this move where he holds his staff above his head, goes for a nice afternoon stroll, and then he'll grab it with 2 hands and do another windup for like 2 seconds, and then slam it down instantaneously. like the windup is so long i could apply for a job, go to the interview, get married, have kids, grow old, and die of terminal brain damage at the age of 53 before he lets it out. i don't mind the ridiculously long windup on stuff like bosses, but when basically everything you fight in the game does it, it just feels like a stupid gimmick. I have like 190 hours and i still do not have the timing down for margit's stupid downslam. also this game runs really bad for some reason. i've had constant stuttering issues on low settings, and i meet the requirements on steam (16GB RAM, RTX 3070, Ryzen 5 3600). also a little pet peave of mine is that every spell and magical weapon art use the same ear piercing sound. it gets incredibly annoying in some areas, and even more annoying when you go for a spellcaster. the lore's nothing special. i've watched the documentaries people made on it and there's like- nothing. like it explains the story of the bosses, and their stories aren't anything special. like Radahn fights melania and gets his feet taken away and has to ride his treasured horse in the desert forever. Mohg is an average Alabama resident and kidnaps his baby brother for some weird shit. The capital is racist and threw Mohg and Morgot in the sewers because they *gasp* have horns, and that's bad. the world design is ok imo. overall i'd probably give this a 7/10, the combat really weighs it down because it's just a waiting game.
So basically, you'll get a stick or something similar you'll spam hit over and over and over and over and over then roll then spam again over and over and over and over and over and life goes on. Eventually you either make it or chaos make you, pretty easy if you think about it.
O Jogo √© legalzinho mas certamente voc√™ vai passar raiva com bugs, principalmente da camera desaparecendo e rodando, bichos te atacando pelas paredes e golpes atravessando inimigos sem causar dano.
One of the best, most densely packed open world RPGs in the world
400+ Hours on a PS5 just for me to be roped back in and buying this game on PC, Elden Ring is the successor to a massive series where they put you in a amazing world with impeccable bosses however, Elden Ring trumps them all in my opinion. It is truly the most incredible game I think I've played in years. It's highly immersive with fun bosses and a git gud mechanic that makes you question life every now and then, but despite it's small amount of bugs (which you'll almost never find) this game is a 11/10 and I can't wait for the DLC. Thank you Elden Ring, very cool! (also i hate you mohg)
Simping blue doll, I enjoy it
Absolute masterpiece, mine, and many others, favourite game of all time. This game changes your perspective on gaming. I have been introduced into an entire new genre, that is now my favourite genre of all time. The atmosphere, the boss fights, the variety, are all utterly gorgeous, i have beaten this countless times now, killed all bosses, and have got all achievements, but to this day I am still finding new places, and even the old places I am still in awe at. I would recommend this game to ANYONE of ALL ages. Absolute must play.

The more you die the more you love the game.
Just dont die before playing this game.

almost 150 hrs, finished 2x and on my 3rd run for the upcoming dlc. hard but fun game! there's a lot of build and strategies u can use.
justice for my glorious Blaidd
great and fun game (ignore the pain of getting better)
I married a witch.

It consumed my life for 2 weeks straight.
Started the game Maindenless

After the game still Maidenless

All in All 11/10
I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.

Elden Ring did for Dark Souls what Monster Hunter World did for their franchise.

Revolutionized it, bringing quality of life and appeal to the masses.

I've already beaten it on Playstation, playing it now on PC.

AMAZING its like getting pulled under water when your in the ocean and you cant get up so you get dragged out to sea and die
good game
buying 4 rings for Ranni is expensive but worth it.
I returned to Elden Ring after a bit of a hiatus and it is a genuinely astounding game. I continue to find entire areas to explore that I never even realized were there, and I continue to find new weapons, builds, and playstyles to engage with. And I know I'm barely scratching the surface, I'm still on my first run. It's an amazing game that deserves your time and patience, because sometimes it will test it. But I've found that the game has a great way of making you take a step back, re-evaluate, and come back to a problem later. I'm a busy person, and Elden Ring's structure means that I have a lot of check in points that make it easy to put the game down for a bit and pick it up when I have time without missing a step.

2nd best fromsoft game, right behind dark souls 2
[h3]A Journey of a Game[/h3]
Same Darksouls'esk combat, but now in an open world (and with a designated jump button).
Game is massive and can take casual players (like myself) upwards of a hundred hours to see it all, but the game is quite an impressive feat. If such an aspect seems daunting, don't be discouraged as you can chip away at the game at your own pace. 

Whilst I recommend this game, my one noticeable gripe is the heavier focus on a lot of bosses having a lot of intentionally delayed attacks, which can really throw out players dodge timing. This is more apparent with some bosses than others, but this overused aspect is done enough where some hits you take may feel unfair. 

That said; Game is a lot more generous on progression and how you chose to tackle obstacles. Being an open world vs the more linear gameplay of the Soulsborne series, it allows you to explore other areas if you end up running into a tough boss or area. Game encourages exploration, and (at times) rewards players for said exploration. 

Overall, Fromsoft took the best of what worked in their other souls games and applied them here into one big package. 
Enjoy.
fun game hard to play

This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I would strongly recommend for anyone who enjoys soulslike games.
finally beat the game after 2 years very good game
all my files got corrupeted very happy game
good game
the tree sentinel is harder than malenia, but other than that, pretty easy. i'm definitely the blade of miquella now
my first real attempt at playing a souls title and its quickly turned into one of my favourite games
Life-changing. First experience with a massive open world and true souls experience, and it completely changed my mindset on what a single player could be. From the sheer volume of side-quests, dungeons, nooks, and crannies to explore to the incredibly well designed and unique boss designs, this game really managed to capture the "soul" of a true medieval fantasy open world. In terms of visuals, there's little in the way of competition: the scenery and attention to detail for each and every single biome and castle was painstakingly detailed and it showed. The game-play was revolutionary in the myriad of ways to cater the game to your exact preference: from magic to strength builds, the game is playable in every way imaginable with the bosses to test your skills to their absolute max. Lastly, the story. With the legend George R. R. Martin spearheading the story, it's little surprise that the story was a masterpiece. Fed piecemeal throughout the game, it balanced answering questions with even more questions and gave opportunity to massive lore pages to explore the finer details of the game in exciting, fun new ways. However, the game can become a little difficult and almost requires you to search things up at some points to progress forward, but there are plenty of resources available. (Performance also held steady for the most part, but it's capped at 60 fps).  An absolute recommendation for anyone who's willing to struggle, explore, and enjoy a breathtaking story set amidst breathtaking visuals.

Elden Peak >>> Ubislop
Probably the best first playthrough of any game ever.
Don't really like open worlds (and imo the open world aspect of this game is not super interesting to me and sometimes detracts from the quality and memorability of areas) but this game delivers on the joy of exploration very well. The combat is tight and intense, though too many bosses have bs moves that you need to look up how to dodge. The start of the game to me is the weakest, I just could not for the life of me figure out where to go to get stronger to be able to beat Margit, so I ended beating my head against the wall for like 3 hours until I took him down. Pretty demoralizing. There were many points where I had to put the game down due to lack of interest, but eventually I came back and by god the final third of the game is so much fun. Definitely an overall good experience, though certainly not a perfect game (as with the dark souls games)
It's so fun but wildly challenging.
fml
Fantastic Game!!
Elden Ring was the first FromSoftware souls game I ever played. At first, I hated the game because I didn't understand it. I was lost. I was maidenless. But over time, I began to learn, I began to adapt, I began to overcome, and eventually, I became the Elden Lord. 

I have every achievement for Elden Ring on Steam and Xbox. 
I also have the platinum trophy for Elden Ring on PS5 and PS4.

After falling in love with Elden Ring, I immediately went back and conquered Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 1, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and Demon's Souls Remake. 

As you can see, I am no longer maidenless. 

Do I recommend Elden RIng, the game of a generation, to other players?
Yes.
dlc hype, replaying on pc
.
Arise Tarnished, the seat of the Elden Lord awaits.
yeah this game is solid

liar ahead, dog
best game of all time
game
Best Game yesyes
THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER FUCKING PLAYED
yes
What a game. If you had fun with Dark Souls, then you'll love this. Elden Ring is not too linear and it makes it so much more enjoyable since there are things you have to find naturally. It hits the dopamine reward center much better than a game that hand holds you through its entirety. 10/10 Game of the decade.
yurrrrr listen man
Great game.
 Riding torrent like my last name is torrent
Elden Ring is possibly the best action RPG game of the last 10 years and certainly earned game of the year. Great visuals, beautiful graphics and a wild story & characters. The mechanics are easy to learn and difficult to master. It's very satisfying to play.
Don't let people lie to you about the difficulty. Elden Ring is only as hard as you want it to be. A strength build with the Lion's Claw Greatsword and Rotten Stray summon absolutely steamrolls the game and can easily be set up in less than an hour. Likewise magic can trivialize the difficulty as well. No matter your skill level, you can experience Elden Ring to the fullest. 
Join us Tarnished. Across the fog. In the Lands Between.
Top 10 game of all time
Way too good of a game
This game is like an abusive girlfriend you keep going back to. Would recommend.
Game good
PLEASE FELLOW TARNISHED, FOR THE LOVE OF MARIKA BUY THIS MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Melenia is a whore, but overall is a very good game, the graphics are top tier, and the story line makes me wanna bust.
I'M LATHERED UP IN HONEY RADAGON, WTF DO YOU WANT FROM MEEEEEEEE
DLC where art thou?
dumb ass freaking game would 100% the game again

very good
its funny how game that released more than 2 years ago still has the same issues it had on launch, the stuttering makes it literally unplayable

not being able to run stable 60fps on 1080p lowest settings while being on RTX 3060 is a joke

Great game, still maidenless though.

10/10 up to Morgott. Beyond him it drops to a 7/10. The sheer amount of annoying, overpowered bullshit attacks bosses get after Morgott is astounding.

great

this game is so sigma
big hammer SMASH
Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here,
If you have never played a proper SoulsBourne game before you should prepare for a challenge harken back to when games were not just glorified visual novels. This game is not easy abandon any hope of breezing through thinking it will be simple. however, you should be aware that the satisfaction from defeating a boss after a multi hour fight makes the anger the annoyance the dread all worth it in the end. I can only recommend that you take the plunge into this epic adventure but only you can solve the final question.
Are you feeling lucky, punk.
good
If Souls-like always interested you but it scared you. This is a game worth trying.
Even though I have had a hard time with Dark Souls 3, The magic system is way better and if a viable option for a strict MAGE Build.
make sure u don't have a wife or kid because u might end up hitting them after playing this game.
gave me anger issues 4h in
i just love the game over all
nice
didnt have fun whist playing but still a good game none the less
BEST DARK SOULS GAME EVER
hard
Peak gaming, literally unmatched and I haven't even beaten fire giant.

Oh Elden Ring
Ok so the game is great. However, I fully agree that if you already have a stressed life and you look to chill and have fun, this is not a game for you - it will ruin your life for about 100 hours until you learn how to play.

amazing game
Good game yes

Best game I've played
amazing game, one of my fondest memories of just exploring and finding out that there was more than just limgrave.
i wish i was good at this game
When i started playing this game, i had no facial hair and no self esteem. After beating Radhan, I grew chest hair and a beard. My hair fell off but i look like Kratos now. Thank you FromSoft!! 
Edit: now i have a gf and a wife, this game is awesome. Pd: why is it always no selfesteem.
iim
one of the greatest games of all time
bonk
I want to kill myself because of this game but it still fire
Pure joy

An incredible adventure that heavily rewards exploration, build variety, and repeatedly bashing your head against the same boss for hours at a time. :)
Harken to ME thou foul Tarnished!
git gud
Just like any of their other souls games , I like the philosophy of them , what am I talking about ? Well , see this game as your life , hard sometimes, very very hard in other times , but , what you , the tarnished, always do ? You try again , and again , and again , no matter how many times you die , you always try again , until you defeated it , see this as the problems that life brings to you , and use it as a way to never give up , no matter how many times you may fall , get up , try again , and eventually, you'll do it , for those having a hard time , tomorrow is another day , and if everything feels terrible, then it's not the end , defeat those demons , because in the end , everything is gonna be alright.
10/10

Foul tarnished, in search of the Elden Ring! Emboldened by the flame of ambition!
This game is awesome, never played any of the dark souls games so it took me a while to get the combat down, but it's so cool.
goated game
Do I have to say something???
After on and off playing for two years, I have completed all achievements and am ready to make a review. I will start by saying if youre on the edge about buying this game, do yourself a favor and make the purchase. This is one of the best experiences I have ever had in gaming, from overcoming challenges to exploration and character customization. I have beaten the game three times now on three characters, each using a drastically different build. Finishing your first play-through is daunting as the game is HUGE, but coming back with prior knowledge and then trying out weapons and spells that your build did not allow before is worthwhile and satisfying. Elden Ring has some complex lore, and finding out what is happening is another entire can of worms you are optionally able to open through item descriptions and environment storytelling. This is a whole other layer to the game I explored my second time playing, scouring every inch of the lands between in search of new information to piece together about the demigods, the shattering, and factions. Again, this is entirely optional, the game does not hold your hand in any regard, and treats its players with a level of respect and trust barely seen in todays gaming culture. Overall, I reccommend Elden Ring to anyone looking for a vast open world, a tough challenge, and a replayable masterpiece.
too easy

Title: "Elden Ring: A Mesmerizing Symphony of Lore and Gameplay"

Elden Ring is nothing short of a magnum opus in the realm of action RPGs, brought to life by the venerable FromSoftware and the legendary narrative craftsmanship of George R.R. Martin. This collaboration has resulted in a game that is both an ode to classic high fantasy and a testament to the evolving landscape of interactive storytelling.

From the moment you step into the Lands Between, the sheer scale of Elden Ring's open world is both daunting and exhilarating. The meticulous world-building is evident in every corner, from the hauntingly beautiful ruins of ancient civilizations to the grotesque, Lovecraftian monstrosities that roam the land. The environmental storytelling is unparalleled, with each locale offering a tapestry of lore that beckons the player to explore and unravel the mysteries of this fractured world.

The gameplay mechanics are a harmonious blend of familiar Soulsborne elements and innovative new features. Combat is as visceral and precise as ever, demanding both skill and strategy. The addition of a dedicated jump button and mounted combat on your spectral steed, Torrent, adds a refreshing layer of verticality and mobility to encounters. The intricate web of character customization, spellcasting, and weaponry ensures that no two playthroughs are ever the same, encouraging players to experiment and adapt.

Multiplayer interactions, through both cooperative and competitive play, seamlessly integrate into the world. The phantasmal silhouettes of other players, bloodstains revealing their demises, and cryptic messages left behind all contribute to a sense of a shared, yet solitary, journey. This asynchronous multiplayer experience enhances the game's immersion, making the world feel alive and inhabited by countless unseen souls.

Elden Ring‚Äôs narrative is a rich, interwoven tapestry that demands active engagement. The lore is dispersed through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and environmental cues, rewarding players who take the time to delve deeper into the story. The convergence of George R.R. Martin's mythos with Hidetaka Miyazaki's signature storytelling results in a narrative that is both grand in scope and intimate in its emotional beats.

The graphics and art direction are nothing short of breathtaking. The juxtaposition of ethereal beauty and grotesque horror creates a visual symphony that is both mesmerizing and unsettling. Each frame of Elden Ring could be a painting, meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of awe and dread.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a masterclass in game design, world-building, and storytelling. It stands as a monumental achievement in the genre, pushing the boundaries of what an open-world action RPG can be. Whether you are a seasoned Souls veteran or a newcomer to FromSoftware‚Äôs enigmatic worlds, Elden Ring offers an unforgettable journey that will be discussed and dissected for years to come. Prepare to lose yourself in the Lands Between, where every death is a lesson and every discovery is a triumph.
I still need to git gud
Amazing game. Just a tad too long

god game just get good.
Its a very good game :)
After Beating Maleania Life is Complete
its elden time
good
haha funny game
my favorite game
this game is the definition of masterpiece
This game is fantastical and all of the bosses and even side characters can serve a awesome fight. Although I highly recomend searching up what each button/keybind does because the game tells you very little of what to do. To solve this there are awesome videos online explaining to you.
It's a videogame that videogames.
Master Hewg still the best maiden

10/10 from a maidenless
If I could pick one game that I've played to play again for the first time it would be Elden Ring. I recommend going in blind, not looking anything up online, or watching videos because the experience is just that good. Have fun tarnished, may the flames of ambition guide you.
Exploration, Scenery, Great Views, Masochistic tendency to run head first into a boss fight because "maybe this way will work" or " I won't get hit buy that again" to have that work but still get hit and die to try again.
If dark souls II was so bad then why did they make dark souls II 2
Great Game
best
fuck you radagon i'll kill you 300 times if i have to. motherfucker
GOAT
I will never actually complete any openworld game
no1 game on this whole planet ong
if you want a challenge and over 100h of game play then this is the game for you
good
I love elden ring:D
one of the best games i have ever played, can't wait for the dlc!
Elden Ring builds on the best of the Dark Souls series without lacking a personality of it's own. The inclusion of an open world made people wary before release, but it was implemented well and leaves me excited for the upcoming DLC.
I love Elden Ring. It was tough at first but i got better and had lots of fun fighting all the different bosses throughout the different zones.
Best souls game ive ever played 

Yes

peak.
I never thought the souls-genre would be anything for me, but after playing Elden ring i'm completely blown away.
This is by far the most fun i've had in an open world, where the areas felt so immersive and non-empty. The visuals are also absolutely stunning in every corner of the map  Exploring this game brought me so much joy. This is also by far the best boss and enemy designs i have ever seen. All the bosses are so beautiful, gross and cool at the same time, and the cut scenes make the fights even better. This game also made me really appreciate difficulty. As someone who has only played a handful of "hard games" this really was a tough playthrough, but the different builds and insanely cool weapons kept me going, I am so insanely happy that i gave this masterpiece a try and i haven't been so excited for a dlc than i have for shadow of the erdtree, which looks like the perfect expansion. I couldn't recommend this game enough, fromsoftware has truly created a masterpiece with Elden ring. 10/10 and the best game i have ever played.
You just gotta have faith, mann
one of the best action rpg games ever made, with an unmatched open world.
big chungus game
What can I say its a fromsoft game.
A great title that brings joy to me, probably the most refined souls experience made so far
didn't expect good game, therefore but hole
Greatest game in history.
10/10 would recommend to George Washington and Helen Keller
Pretty good innit
One of the best games I've played.
bbbbbbbb
Prepare to suffer, but have a good time doing it.
Top 5 game all time.
great, awesome, cinematic, perfection.
game should be like this. i dont have a regret for paying this full game
There is a certain other version of the game on the net. Without Easy Anti Cheat. That version manages to provide what FromSoft, after all these years, still can't provide: A steady framerate. Buy at your own risk. If you want a flawless experience of the game, get it "elsewhere".
game good
This is the best game I have ever played.
more triple a garbage that feels meaningless
Incredible
This is the best game in the world.

Challenging but equally satisfying game (as expected from a Souls game). I've been a long-time Souls fan, but never had a PC strong enough to run a game and this was the first game I bought on Steam. Not disappointed at all.
EPIC
good ass game

An amazing and unique experience.
Dog
good game, a bit too easy tho
"You've played for 765 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?" is crazy
Great game alot of fun. only wish you could use your mount more
While there are some issues with the transition to the open world formula, among other design philosophy problems, you'd have to be stupid not to get this. It's great.
awesome game
good game, play
Good game
If you like cool weapons, cool armour, fun a difficult bosses, beautiful scenery, magic and feet then play Elden Ring you won't regret it
gg
Peak fiction
dumb and boring
Ahh, I knew you'd come. 
To stand before Elden Ring. To think about buying this masterpiece. What a beautiful state of affairs.
I commend your gaming spirit and, alas, you shall take the throne if you've the strength (and 50-70 bucks).
I have high hopes for you, ye Tarnished.
Soon you shall play Elden Ring, unto eternity.

(I suck at these games and 350+ hour on Steam, 100+ on Xbox and another 100+ on Playstation. Yeah, that's how good it is.)

ABSOLUTELY STUNNING AND BEAUTIFUL WITH GREAT STORY, FIGHTING MECHANIC, CHARACTER DESIGNS AND GRAPHICS
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I hope i find some time to play it with him, because i heard a lot of good things about this game.

Buy Elden Waifu
SO SICK! Don't give up. The  reward of getting better at something is as valuable in this game as it is in real life.  Git Gud, quit being a scrub.
awesome, also fire giant sucks but thats about it
An incredible gaem trust (i've killed like 2 bosses what possibly could go wrong :D )
Top 5 all time
has the singular best worldbuilding ive ever seen from a game
One of, if not, the best game ever created.  Got it on sale for $40 and have over 500 hours played.  100% worth the money, even at regular price.  Can't wait for the DLC next week.

If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge Elden Ring Enemies and Bosses.
It's so hard, but it makes me so hard too.
Words cannot describe how this game is.
large W for gaming
a fat guy and his thin friend walks into a bar.
good game very fun
Many many many many hours of gameplay, able to co-op inviting friends. 

Downside: Quests are unclear and have no trackable progress in game (like a quest journal) and some activities can cause quests to be incompletable. 
Downside to co-op: You can be invaded by other players who can kill you to delay your progress who can try to bait you into enemies who wont attack them. BUT you can kill them and get runes and items as rewards. However especially at low level zones, you get invaded by people in end game gear who just want to kill lowbies to prevent them from progressing. Also cant invite players to join in an area you have defeated the big boss in. Can still be invited to their games in that zone.

Well worth it though. Many many playstyles, able to respec completely after progressing to a certain point and try other playstyles.

Loving this game so much.
Good game

i wish it preformed how it does now at launch as it would've been a 10/10
It has both gods and dogs.
good stuff
good
GG

10/10
This is one of the best video games I've ever played and that's before playing the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, game has a very fun challenge attached to it and I've spent over 200 hours playing this game since I got it, the visuals are gorgeous, the world is full of surprises, the combat is to fun play with and the game has an interesting multiplayer system where you can cooperate or compete with other players playing the game.
very fun great bosses great level system first souls game would recommend
Masterpiece
bonk big men
Best Game 2023 for a reason. I didnt do anything but this game when it came out
It's alright i guess.
This is a beautiful game with rich lore and I really wanted to enjoy it which is why I put so many hours into it. But unfair bosses (looking at you Godskin Duo) that are total cheats and having things I earned taken away (like runes and phased Bosses, why do I have to giht Beast Clergyman dozens of times after killing him, I EARNED that phase by killing him the first time) are just signs of some serious game theory flaws. It's about 99% STRESS, 1% fun.  And it's a real shame because this SHOULD be a fun game.
100/10
Lives up to hype.
i cant withstand this beauty.
[h1]The Worst: Questing[/h1]
No journal, no explanation, no narration, no lore. 
You meet a dude randomly in a field, he gives you a "cursed putrid eyeball of swamp a baby" and asks you to bring it to Bob the Cursed Eyeball Eater. You search everywhere, can't find him. Then search google just to find that he spawns in some cave that you cleared 20hrs ago and didn't even thought of returning there. You go there and find a "Ball Bearing [Bob]". Turns out when you step your foot into some world region before talking to Bob he goes ahead and dies. Congrats you've locked yourself out of reward for the rest of the game.

[h1]The Bad: Controls[/h1]
Console Port. 
Not the worst port I've seen but the fact that [b]you have one button for sprint & dodge[/b] on PC speaks volumes. And don't even get me started on target locking. You fight a boss, you skillfully dodge his attacks and charge up your counter and then some random squirrel runs into view screen. Lock switches to squirrel last second and it gets obliterated by your "mega death laser attack". YOU DIED!
You have [1..0] buttons on your keyboard to access items on PC. What you do instead? - Press [Cycle Item] couple of times and then press [Use Item]. Oh you scrolled past the healing pot? Too bad - scroll again. YOU DIED!

[h1]The Alright - Gameplay[/h1]
The bosses. 
Let's be real here - the main point of this game is killing bosses. You grind some gear and XP, learn some moves and then test your skill against "Cursed Sad Omen of Despair" or something. You get head bashed in tens of times then you figure out that either you're under level or your build is complete trash. You farm better gear and new levels, get some more healing pots and then kill the boss on your 5th try. Then you go find next one to fight. It is extremely satisfying to figure out bosses moves, dodge them and then punish the boss. Except Runebears.. YOU DIED!


[h1]The Good - Builds[/h1]
The amount of weapons, armor and magic is crazy! There are fixed ways you can play the game - slow melee, fast melee, magic, (not sure about bow feels lacking). But the variations of gear and skills you can apply to each of this play style is huge! Wanna be classic paladin? No problem! Wanna be mage? Sure! Wanna be naked butt dude with a leather gimp mask and whip? No-one is stopping you! This honestly is a selling point for the replayability - you can go NG+ or start a new game just to try out new build in hopes of finding something OP that would wreck the boss that gave you nightmares back when.

[h1]The Great - Art[/h1]
The world.
It is MASSIVE and beautiful.  The amount of land you can explore, nooks and crannies to wonder into and secrets to find is just mind blowing. There is something very enchanting about the art in this game. Maybe because it is so surreal and defies anything I've seen in other open world titles but its definitely breathtaking. The world feels a bit dead though and I keep wondering if it is by design or just poor communication of lore to the player.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Honestly don't know why it's critically acclaimed, I'd give it [7/10]. This i s a solid game that will keep calling you back even despite the awful console port.

good I REFUND

CONCLUSION: Dark Souls 4 in open world (unfortunately audio, animations, hud...are pretty same. I expect different/new elements in the game with a new title). For those who have never played DS games before, the elden ring will be one of the best games ever in SL genre, it is also more accessible for weaker players in SL world. On the other hand you can find amazing boss fights here, great exploration of open world and the character development is as deep as you would expect from dark souls genre and thats my biggest plus of this game.

FINAL SCORE 8.0
Un peu comme zelda au nintendo, la casette en or. 10/10
"EZ GAME"
Video games are great cuz its like you get an action figure to dress up and fight bad dudes with and this game prolly has the most you can do with your action figure
GOAT game
when I started out playing I was bad, enraged, quit every 5 mins, and maidenless. Now after playing, I'm still maidenless.
Cinema
so good
Pros: 
made me forget I had a life before 
made me go bald 
gave me stockholm syndrome
and made me realize Malenia is the blade of Miquella 

Cons: 
fuck that ass water of a boss design they call fire giant 
fuck the foreskin duo
i think i like this game
Absolutely love this game!
I've completed a few hard games, and really had high expectations for this one. And never have I been so much dissapointed by a game. I think even challenging games should be in some way fun, rewarding, satisfying... I found this game only frustrating and unfair. It felt like the game was really against me.
I might give it a try another time and update the review, but right now I find it too hard and frustrating, nothing about the endless tries is fun. If the combat was at least somewhat satisfying or fun...

GG RIP 60‚Ç¨
You don't have the right , O, you don't have the right.
one of the most beautiful games ive played. im addicted highly recommend it
Good shit
A great game that also introduced me to the other souls games. But after playing the others and coming back to Elden Ring, I do notice that a bunch of movesets and assets were reused, and most of the "bosses" are just copy pastes and repetitive. Its an amazing game for your first and second playthrough but I think it falls off after that.
It's ok.
Elden Ring is by far the best game out there. The story is incredibly immersive and complex. The overall feel of the game is dark and sad - just like the other souls games. Boss fights, and just fights in general are always challenging. The areas, buildings, and landscapes are stunning as well as the graphics in general. Highly recommend if you have enjoyed any of the souls games - this one takes the cake.
is it a dog?
Sick game would recommend.
 i cant see the main story  and when u got any quest there is no log so saw it again
PLAY IT
review ahead
Honestly its just okay
In the realm of Elden Ring, where ethereal mists shroud the ancient lands and forgotten kingdoms, a masterpiece emerges, wrought by the hands of celestial artisans. The tapestry of this world, woven with intricate lore and formidable foes, beckons the intrepid adventurer. Each step taken on hallowed ground unveils the grand narrative, an epic of fallen gods and cursed legacies. The combat, an art of calculated precision, demands unwavering resolve. Enigmatic landscapes, sculpted with arcane finesse, whisper secrets to those who dare explore. Elden Ring, a paragon of interactive storytelling, ensnares the soul, offering a transcendent odyssey through its somber magnificence.
Try fingers
But hole
Absolute Epicness!
Best game for solo play
One of the best games ever!
goated
FromSoftware has once again woven a masterpiece with Elden Ring, a game that transcends the boundaries of traditional RPGs and sets a new standard for open-world gaming. As a longtime fan of FromSoftware's work, I approached Elden Ring with high expectations, and I can confidently say that it not only met but exceeded every one of them.

One of the most striking aspects of Elden Ring is its vast and breathtaking open world. The Lands Between is a sprawling, interconnected realm filled with awe-inspiring landscapes, hidden secrets, and diverse ecosystems. From the towering mountains of Limgrave to the ethereal beauty of the Weeping Peninsula, every corner of the world feels meticulously crafted and teeming with life. The sense of exploration is unparalleled, with every hill and valley beckoning the player to uncover its mysteries.

But it's not just the world itself that impresses; it's what you do in it that truly sets Elden Ring apart. The game offers unparalleled freedom, allowing players to tackle challenges in any order they choose. Whether you prefer to engage in epic boss battles, delve into ancient ruins, or embark on quests for the game's myriad NPCs, there's always something new and exciting to discover. The sheer scope of content is staggering, with hundreds of hours of gameplay awaiting those who dare to venture off the beaten path.

Of course, no FromSoftware game would be complete without its trademark difficulty, and Elden Ring delivers in spades. Combat is as punishing as ever, requiring precise timing, strategic thinking, and a willingness to learn from failure. But unlike some of the developer's previous titles, Elden Ring strikes a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility. With a wide range of weapons, spells, and abilities at your disposal, there's always a solution to even the toughest of encounters, encouraging experimentation and creativity.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of Elden Ring is its storytelling. FromSoftware has crafted a rich and immersive narrative that unfolds organically as you explore the world. Through cryptic item descriptions, enigmatic NPCs, and haunting environmental storytelling, players are gradually drawn into a dark and fascinating tale of gods, dragons, and the fate of the world itself. It's a narrative that rewards patience and attention to detail, with each new revelation adding depth and meaning to the world around you.

In the end, Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a game that pushes the boundaries of what we thought possible in an open-world RPG, offering unparalleled freedom, challenge, and storytelling in equal measure. From its breathtaking world design to its punishing yet rewarding combat, every aspect of the game feels meticulously crafted and expertly executed. Whether you're a longtime fan of FromSoftware or a newcomer to the genre, Elden Ring is an experience that simply cannot be missed. With its richly detailed world, challenging gameplay, and compelling storytelling, it's not just a game ‚Äì it's a journey. And it's one that I'll gladly embark on again and again. Elden Ring is, without a doubt, a perfect 10 out of 10.
Good game
Solid game
Funny enough, killing a god but cant kill a damn bird :(
Just keep trying-
Fantastic journey
another near perfect would-die-again adventure.

can't wait for the DLC
bad

I really can't reccomend this game enough. Elden Ring is my first soulsborne game, and i (as expected) got completely destroyed in my first couple hours of playing. i ended up uninstalling is and shelfing the game for a couple of months until a friend got me into it again. now i'm about 60 hours in my save file and i can confirm that thisone of the best games i have ever played. the environment is gorgeous, the combat is exciting while also giving a sense of accomplishment, and don't even get me started on how much i love the characters and the voice acting. the biggest hurdle i believe is the combat, and how some enemies aren't even meant to be defeated the first time you encounter them. the best way to get around this though is to take things slow at first and to not bash your head into an enemy too much at the start (like i did).

overall 10/10 game.
Are you looking for the best video game of all time? This is it.
is good
This game is phenomenal hundreds of hours of entertainment and the community is great as well. Play blind if you can.


(Can't wait for the DLC!!!!!!!!)
I guess  it is impossible to overstate my joy from this game, especially from it being my very first soulslike. To be completely honest, i did not even find it much difficult, rather just challenging enough to keep me interested.

12 / 10 would recommend
Cloud this be a Masterpiece?
Yes, I've enjoyed a lot

Great game if you don't have a life :steamhappy:
best game
its the sorta game where you start playing on a sunday morning and before you know it it is night to monday and you dont understand where the time went
Best game ever
i really like gaming on this one
very fun
most difficult part was fighting malenia with one hand
Incredibly overhyped. The story might as well not exist but the characters expect you to know who they are. The boss fights are designed to punish you for trying to follow the timing of the fights. The UI is from the early 2000s. Worst aspect of this game is the camera controls. They are a crime considering how punishing this game is. I really cant over emphasizze how bad the camera is, Target lock is required for many fights because the enemies can fly/teleport/super jump but if the game doesnt detect you are looking exactly at the enemy it will spin around to your characters facing direction. This is often lethal because odds are you are side strafing or backing up. Target lock switches automatically when an enemy dies and if you happen to dodge an incoming attack from the 2nd enemy you will dodge in a different direction. The camera has a max angle and many bosses will fly up directly over you and can't be seen.  Many bosses are in confined spaces which mess with the camera if you get close to a wall. There is particular giant lizard tree thing in these spaces that is around a quarter of the room but can leap across the whole space in under a second which leads to the camera flying around or through the boss making it useless.  I honestly can't believe that there were previous games made by this developer in this genre (that they defined) because this feels like the bottom of the barrel.
10/10. Unstoppable nautilus build. De nghi Fromsoft can bang lai game. WOULD RECOMMEND.
I'm sure this is a fine game, just... not for me. if you already struggle with real life, then getting kicked in the balls by a depressingly dreary and difficult game just isn't it. no disrespect, just.... I imagine you gotta be in the right mindset to like this
Malenia.
whiting out the screen before the last boss.
Everything else is gold.
this game sucks
10/10 would recommend
Ye
game awsome
to goods
good game
Praise the Elden Ring!
if you want to kys play elden ring!
very good mad if bad
GOOD GOOD GOOD
Great Story, amazing ending, quality content. Fully expected from FromSoft. Thanks for an excellent game <3
............
Game is awesome!
Hot off Radagon pissing me off, but still a great fight. I got gud, as some might say...
good

Hard for sure id look at other people playing it before you buy it keep in mind that all the souls games are hard so dont get angry when people say eldenring is the easyest souls game trust me its alot easyer then something like blood born but still really hard
Trust me bro, play Elden Ring.
awesome game!
the only game with a horse
Gurd
wow
Elbering
You'll either love it or hate it. Even if you love it, you'll still hate it from time to time.
fun
One of the greatest games ever created hands down.
horse

I love elden riung eldenr
the best game i have ever play
DS III 2
The storyline is great. The combat system is unique to me and makes it hard but fun. Love the graphics as well as the endless builds you can make
Excelent game!!
no longer a virgin due to this game
you have died
yes
is good
Easy to play RPG that gives players experience in life lessons.
Perfect
As my first Souls Game I've found it to be one of the most fun and refreshing games i've played in years.
I was once a hoonter

I was once a shinobi

Now, I am a maidenless Tarnished
great game with in depth development. favourite game to come out the past decade.

yes
Best game i have ever played!
:3
Weirdly one of the easiest Fromsoft games to platinum
in my top 5 fav games ever fs
This game might be good
Its fun as fuck
GG
this game is perfect ima buss ahh?!
I absolutely hate this game, made me want to kick a old person's cane while they're walking home from church
:D
It is very Good wish it had Gabriel
Yeah it's aight
One of the best games i have ever played
a game like no other. worth the 200+ hrs played
Fantastic build variety, boss design, legacy dungeons, color scheme, voice acting. I spent 80 full hours in my first playthrough and put another 250 in on Xbox. After switching to PC and giving Fromsoftware another deserved $60 I've put another 125 hours in. Overall, I think a single player game's ability to siphon over 400 hours out of me speaks for itself. I've played the game 16 different times in 16 different ways. the only thing wrong is the lazy attempt at an Ornstein and Smough redesign.
Visions of fun
I DID IT! ...BUT STILL MAIDENLESS

Elden Ring: Where I traded my social life, relationships, and sanity for 100% achievements and a sense of accomplishment that will never be recognised by anyone outside of this dark, dark community.

Pros:

¬∑    I now know the true meaning of suffering
¬∑    My reflexes are sharper than ever 
¬∑    I've mastered the art of crying myself to sleep

Cons:

¬∑    I've forgotten what the sun looks like
¬∑    My friends and family think I've joined a cult
¬∑    I've developed a strange fondness for melancholic music and rain

10/10 would recommend to my enemies."
Very good game, story is trash and doesnt make sense, its impossible to find the NPC quest, Overall very good
Strong foe ahead
- Right amount of difficulty, not too hard and not very easy.
- Beautiful effects
- Masterpiece Opening BGM
- Maiden
- Radahn and Malenia are the only challenges
good game
YES
the best game ever made
best game ever made
ÈáçÁîü‰πãÊàëÊòØËâæÂ∞îÁôªÊ≥ïÁà∑
absolutely peak of game, there is a reason why this won game of the year in 2020, a true masterpiece, I'm so excited for the dlc in a couple days
Game of the Year for a reason. Rewards patience and skill, and makes you feel like you truly earned your victories.
Absolute GOAT of a game
Experi√™ncia lend√°ria de video game. Evolu√ß√£o em quase todos os pontos da franquia souls, combate din√¢mico, mapa aberto, extremamente desafiador ao mesmo tempo que com devido estudo do jogo pode ficar muito facil, o p√≥s game dele √© um pouco menos animador que os dark souls pois tem muita coisa a se fazer.
Easily one of the best games ever made. Buy it.
I just spent the first 7 hours trying to fight the horse guy thinking he was some boss I could win against... news flash, didn't win. Good game design can't wait for more
yeah ima take a longgg break.
If you like Dark Souls, BB, Demon Souls, ect you'll probably like this a lot. The variety of weapons, spells, and armor is almost overwhelming. As such there is a lot of build variety. PVP is business as usual if you liked it in the other games you'll like it in this game. My only complaints are some side dungeons feel kind of unnecessary (very similar), there are regular enemies reused as bosses, and npc quest lines can be very annoying to keep track of as there are many of them. Its not fun finding out a quest line is ruined because I stepped into a different zone. To be fair this has always been a thing in souls games so its whatever. Overall an amazing game that I definitely recommend, especially if your a souls fan.
Playing Elden Ring feels like trying to navigate a labyrinth blindfolded, with a chicken drumstick in one hand and a rubber ducky in the other. It's chaotic, it's absurd, and I love every second of it! 10/10, would get lost in the Land Between again... just as soon as I find my way out of this boss fight!
very good

this is hell
Amazing Game 10/10
this game freaking rules.
love beeing invaded by some one way and above my lv, what looked like unlimited flasks eventual tanking framerates boot me out
good
If you like to create your own class style or RP a certain way, This game gives you some of the best options to do so. Highly recommend this game for patient people.
good :)
mhm
second time buying it, 400 hours on xbox, really wanted to play seamless, love this game so much cant wait for dlc
I often recount the sense of discovery and adventure as I explored the vast open world of elden ring, encountering epic boss battles, uncovering hidden secrets, and delving into the lore of the game. From exhilarating triumphs against challenging foes to hilarious mishaps and unexpected encounters, every play session was filled with memorable moments that keep me coming back for more.
Beautiful game
tree sentinel huwted my fweelings
10 hrs in and I've accomplished almost nothing.  But its been a very enjoyable 10 hrs and looking forward to the next 50+ :-)  Controls are easy to pick up and the graphics and gameplay are legit.   Lack of structure/direction/where to go next took some getting used to.  But its a very addictive game.
I'm so hard 

it has the LOATHSOME ASS EATER
The game of all time.
One of the best games I've ever played 10/10.  Can be frustrating but just leave and come back. well worth it
i snuck around the first boss while he was munching on some random dude
great
Very peaceful and calming game
While not my favorite of the souls games to play, it definitely has grown on me after giving it another go.
sad game, made me cry
Eldest Ring
Amazing game!
this game made someone sad it wasnt me but it was someone
First Dark Souls genre game ever. Tough at first, just as tough later. Jump, Roll, Parry, Shield, or just one shot everything with a silly magic build, it's that simple. In my case, big sword go bonk.
good game
bery good game

RPG? What role am I playing? The victim?

It's addictive!
Offer dog. 

Look up dog. 

Dog ahead. 

Need I say more?
i am pissing and shitting over malenia 10/10
great visual storytelling, great game play, great game.
This game is amazing
the only single player game ive played and beat multiple times over and stil dont get bored!
It's so good, couldn't see much, kept dying u know..
spent 4 hours dying to tree sentinel, beat him and then realized i could have just sneaked past him. 10/10 would recommend.
Good time
love the game kinda wish it was normal matchmaking instead of joining people who kick you when there losing or dont like being dead
elden bling
I'm so addicted to this game, that i cant stop playing it. I knew what i was getting into when i first bought this game. At first everything was too hard and i thought i couldn't do nothing. but then i pushed forward and i never gave up even if i lost 56 times. i still didn't give up. If you don't give you'll defeat elden ring. DON'T GIVE UP ELDEN RING PLAYERS
i play this game i wouldnt say i have playing but i keep playing
best game ive played ever
Came here for hard game, got hot waifus. Also Blaidd.

This one gives me both... but, now you can jump so we're good.
Elden Ring ahead.
i hate it and love it
great game 10/10
Tip: if you have trouble parrying in Souls games. Sekiro will make you into a parry master by the end of that game.
very very hard game but its also extremely fun to atleast try and beat some bosses (fuk u margit the fell)
.
good hard but good
Der erste Gegner den man schon nach 10 minuten erreicht ist einfach  unm√∂glich und verdirbt einem  den spielspa√ü direkt. ich habe jetzt 2h daran gesessen und maximal 30% abgezogen. Meinem Freund erging es genauso. Selbst wenn man versucht die Angriffsmuster zu studieren √§ndert er diese jedes mal wieder  und du bist in der Regel One Shot. Das Spiel dannach ist bestimmt super aber alleine der erste Boss reicht aus um das Spiel auf garkeinen Fall weiterzu empfehlen. Au√üerdem ist das Combatsystem nicht sonderlich gut und es  wird mitten im Kampf auf einmal ein Schaf im Hintergrund  fokussiert.

This game is genuienly the best game ive ever playing its a masterpeice the only downside being that you really have to have patience for this because its certainly not easy

nothing needs to be said about this game...
game is ass.

S-Tier.
MASTERE PIECE
this has got to be one of the best and funnest games ive ever played. even when i do die 30 times to a boss whenever i finally beat the boss i feel such a sense of accomplishment and pride. i highly recommend this game best use of $40.00 i've ever spent
Still on tree sentinel but the game is goated fr fr no diddy
Some boss killed me over 300 times before i finally won, jokes on her im into that shit.
Masterpiece!
Best game of 2020s
Shit game <3
This game is very hard. It took over my life for 2 months and there were times where I absolutely hated this game. I almost quit many times. I kept at it because I didn't want it to beat me and I found some of it fun. A lot of it feels unfairly difficult though.  
I did get serious burnout from playing this game. This game is not as good as what a lot of people say. I put so much energy in trying over and over to beat creatures and bosses that a lot of the lore was lost on me because the intense difficulty does often break the immersion as it's beyond "a bit challenging"
People will say "well this game doesn't hold your hand" which is true enough. But in many places, the game also expects you to be psychic, because there were lots of places where I thought "How was anyone supposed to know that, or figure that out" which I feel is not the same thing as "not holding your hand". When I looked for solutions, I often found many other confused people who thought the same as I did. I think those who say they didn't need to look up tips on how to beat at least some of the bosses or how to do things in the game are lying. 
I deliberately waited three months to leave a review because I knew that if I did it right after I finished the game, it would have been negative. Finishing the game was like finally leaving a relationship that has too much of a hold on you in an unhealthy way. But now some of the rose tinted glasses are kicking in a little and I'm remembering some of the good parts of the game. The music, how it looks, the landscapes/scenery, and even though I didn't know what I was doing or why I was doing it most of the time, it was good to explore this world. 
When I finally killed Elden Beast, I turned it off with 100% achievements and said "Never Again" with this game. But, three months on, I'm not so sure. Maybe when I can get the upcoming DLC on a sale, I'll get it if the sale is good enough and play it. Maybe not straight away as I need a much bigger gap away from this game before I ever pick it up again. 
This was my first Souls game. In fact, I didn't even know what a souls game was until I had started playing, and the friend who recommended it to me explained it to me. it was definitely a learning curve.  
I can't see me ever picking up a different souls game because I realised it wasn't really my thing, but I might play this again one day. Especially as I've heard this is a baby when it comes to souls games and by no means the most punishing one. 
If you like a challenge, this isn't it. The word I'd describe this game is "Punishing". It's just a whole other level. But also "Intriguing" and "Beautiful"
So I will recommend this game to try, but a soft recommend with caution. You might want to quit early on. But if you don't, it will keep pulling you back even though you often hate it. But I'm still glad that I didn't quit early.
the amount of hemorrhoids this game gave me... I was a different man back then...
i love the elden rings!

135 hours and i still havent reached altus plateau and i'm still satisfied with my time spent
yes
game oh game, 1 hit kill, 2 bosses at once, illusory walls and undodgeable attacks
devs oh devs I wonder is this much pain really necessary?
and yet I still play
Great game, looks good too.

UNTIL MALENIA
buy it now

Git Gud
welp its ok i guess :)
Perfection.
big gud
My only gripe with this game is that there isn't enough structure for my preference. I'd like better quest and location tracking. Something basic like a location checklist would be plenty, even if it's just an area complete yes or no.

Other than that, this is one of the best games I've ever played. Great graphics, an abundance of freedom of choice to go anywhere and do anything in the way you want to do it. Combat is challenging, and will quickly put you in your place if you aren't giving it the proper attention.
After 235 Hour playing and struggling finally finished the game compeltly and that was an awsome exprience
Heck yeah

i hate this game
Best FromSoft game on Steam
mind blowing game, just incredible
a
very good
I am no longer maidenless
One off the best games i ever played, brought back the same feelings off amazemet that i first had when i played dark souls 1
The more i play the better the game becomes, there are just so many viable builds to try out, the world is massive with secrets around every corner to discover, cant wait for the dlc to come out
10/10 game for me
good game
One of the best games ever created
liked everything so far
New playthrough just before the DLC releases and this game is just so dense packed with content I still have yet to finish my second playthrough 170 hours in. Even if you didn'y enjoy previous souls games, give this one a try.
h
wow
more gold!!!
just play it.
Fun sword fighting.
alt-f4 heaven
Beautiful
Greatest game ever made. Bought that shit twice
I have never enjoyed a game that wasn't strategy, sandbox, or simulation until I played this game. Fantastic amazing love it.
This game is good as freak even though it makes me mad as freak occasionally
A gift from a dear friend ended up being a game I always return to. I'm not good at it, but I do enjoy it greatly.
Best game ever, absolutely amazing
best game ever...
its coo

( ' u ' )

I really enjoy the game and the replay ability is fun also the game has so much to offer
got onehit by godfrey multiple times
In anticipation of Shadow of the Erdtree I decided to pick up Elden Ring again in order to level up a character and grab all available achievements. It's still good. In fact, it's a disgustingly good game.
Over 500 hours and I'm not even close to an expert.  Few single player games have a spectrum of difficulty this vast.
Game good, good game.
Yes buy and play this game. Simple as that. Very good game. There is a mountain of content to enjoy and explore. The only gripe I have with Elden Ring is that the FromSoftware mindset of "figure it out yourself" does not translate very well to an open world game. Not saying there needs a waypoint, god no it doesn't need that, but a sort of book or journal to track who you've talked to and what they said would be very nice.
Absolutely phenomenal game. Every aspect of it is 10/10 great, the combat, the graphics, the multiplayer, the game world, everything. Tough to get started in it but once you do its hard to put down. Top 10 best games of all time no doubt about it.
if u like dark fantasy get it its good very much reminds me of lord of the rings
reminds me how trash i am at games
One of the best games I have ever played
very sigma game
Top as allways!!
fia feet
best game i have ever touched, first ever playthrough on the xbox i played for 10 hours straight.
This game has me wanting to high jack a car with a baby in it and drive it off a cliff to jump out and open my parachute and watch a cool explosion.
too hard, had to refund
Devs hate gamers with ultra wide monitors. Until they grow a pair, I give thumbs down.
Easy game now
Detailed fun game
yes
AAA
I've played all the souls games and Elden Ring is easily my favorite. The game is beautiful, the bosses are interesting and challenging, character builds are better than ever, and the game is freaking HUGE. On my first playthrough I spent over 100 hours exploring everything and still managed to miss several full areas with enemies, bosses, and quests that I went back for after beating the game.

The combat and character building really shine in this game. I've never seen an RPG that gives the player this much freedom to build and fine tune their character. There are practically infinite combinations of weapons, armors, stats, spells, talismans, and weapon skills. Each playthrough with a new build is a different experience and the build variety keeps PvP fresh and exciting.

Don't be worried about the difficulty if this is your first souls game, the open world format is great for inexperienced players. When you get stuck on a boss, there‚Äôs no need to grind it out and ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù enough to progress. Just go explore the world for a bit, level up and come back later. If you‚Äôre still struggling, you can summon spirit ashes, another player, or both to help you. Not to mention there are some broken character builds that make the game much easier.

The only bad thing about this game is that many of the bosses and enemies are reused. During the first half of the game you'll see nothing but new enemies that feel like they belong, but the late game content feels more rushed. The Mountaintops and Haligtree (two endgame areas) don't have a single unique non-boss enemy in them. All duo fights are just two solo bosses from earlier thrown into one arena, which feels lazy and unfair especially when compared to good duo fights from other souls games. Most of them are optional, but the most annoying one is required to beat the game.

Overall, this is the most polished souls game to date and I think everyone should have the chance to experience it. Even with the cons it's absolutely worth the $60 price tag, but it goes on sale for around $40 every few months if you're willing to be patient.

Almost Perfect.
Probably a bit overdue, but i think i like it

One of the best games out
If this game isnt in your top 10 idk what your smoking and i still havent even scraped the surface of this game
good
best game ever
This game is an absolute masterpiece, and I don't often praise games like this. The world has so much to offer in terms of environment, ambience, architecture, as well as overall content. I love how when you look at certain points of interests when looking at the scenery, you can ACTUALLY go to that point of interest. The game really rewards exploration and I love that. Anyways, Miyazaki the GOAT please add a cutscene where the Tarnished licks Ranni's toes when you find a secret item that can only be unlocked at exactly 56 Vigor after defeating Malenia and Radahn in a marathon without ever getting hit.
I don't need to say much about this
the goat

I really didn't made a review for this game? 
Well, now it's done
best game ive played
DS4 bangs
I've spent over almost 200 hours in this game collectively on Playstation and PC. It can be difficult, but it's always a pleasure to play!
Game of Misery, rating: top 5 of all time.
What else can I say that hasn't been said before? It's Elden Ring, it's great!
ERUDENO RINGU
Between this and Baldurs Gate 3 I have been in Heaven.  This is the penultimate Action Role Playing Game.  It is outstanding!
Praise the Sun!

and has anyone else NEVER fed their horse?
I've never gotten hold of any of the Souls games day one, but I did get Dark Souls 3 just as the Ringed City released. While I generally hate FOMO marketing, it definitely makes a difference to play these games while there are lots of players, with everybody still figuring things out. If you're 100% certain you won't use the online parts of the game then you should wait for a sale though.

Price wise, you can get this and the upcoming DLC for nearly the same price that Elden Ring released at. Not even referring to the dodgy cd key resellers here, Shadow of the Erdtree is a big release so plenty of legitimate shops are doing deals.
Best AAA game of the decade, by quite a margin.
The best game I ever played, I love it
An excellent open-world RPG in all aspects.
It's kinda like a sekisoulsbornecuphead.
If you're a Soulsborne fan, then this game will scratch that itch.  FromSoftware really knocked it out of the park on this one.
My only complaint: I don't like the PvP in this game as much as in Dark Souls 3, but it's still better than Dark Souls 1 PvP, imho.

Other than my small issues with the PvP, I love almost everything:

The massive open world is fun to explore if you like exploring,  It's chock full of hidden items, caves, catacombs, hero graves (basically dungeons), surprise encounters...just about everything.

Huge weapon variety.  
Larger than average moveset variety for a FromSoftware game.
Ashes of War enable me to expand the potential of every weapon via adding a new move to the weapon that either enhances it inherent strengths, or to shore up the weaknesses.  I love the flexibility.

I could gush for several more paragraphs, but if I haven't convinced you by now, I'm probably not going to.
Check it out if you enjoy the poorly-defined souls-like genre.

literally kill yourself first

It is perfect.
10/10 AMAZING IN EVERY WAY!
As someone with a passion for these games and the "-like" I would recommend either this, or Demon Souls, as someones first "souls" game. But they would be spoiled as this is the only souls game with a map, compass, open world, tells you where you dropped your "souls" and much more. I platinum'd this on PS5, then grabbed it on PC for Seamless. Doing a clean legit re-intall for DLC. See y'all in the lands between!
this game makes my balls quiver
literally the greatest game of all time
this game hates me i like it though
it is freaking awesome
Malenia made me psychologically unstable (still smash, though) 10/10
its good, you die alot. so fun.
Awesome
The best game i have played in the last 10 years

Best game of all time, but buff chainsaw and give more albinauric content!
poop
The combat is poorly designed, but the world is fantastic.
gg
good
The best open world game I've played yet. 100/10 world design. Highly recommend to everyone looking for a challenging, rewarding and mind-blowing experience.
nice story
Was going to start replaying because of new DLC coming out, now just get a white screen then crash and not going to spend time fixing what shouldnt have been broken.
Do it coward

amazing masterpiece
ghost of tsushima is soooo cool!!! the game looks amazing like ur in a samurai movie. u play as jin and hes a samurai fighting bad guys who invade his island. the story is super awesome and u feel like a hero.

combat is so fun, u get to use swords and sneak around like a ninja. u can do all these cool moves and combos. theres also a lot of places to explore and the world is beautiful with pretty flowers and stuff.

i love the photo mode, u can take pics of everything and make it look super cool. the game is big, so theres lots to do like side quests and finding stuff. also, the music is really good and makes u feel epic.

some things r a bit hard but it makes u better at the game. i wish there were more animals to pet tho. theres some bugs sometimes but its not too bad.

overall, ghost of tsushima is like the best game ever!!! u should totally play it if u like samurais and awesome fights. 10/10 would play again!!
Only lost half of my sanity, can't wait to finish this game again to lose the other half!
Top 5 Greatest Game ever made... easily. 100% on Xbox and now switched over to PC to do it all again plus new DLC.
Yes/
In this game i feel like home.
9.999/10 but the birds can eat me
This game doesn't want you to play it, it wants you to die, both in game and mentally.
Upd: ok, my previous words are true, but the feeling of accomplishment you get is only comparable to getting your dream job.

Very good
Very gud game
This game was the realization of all those saturday morning living room floor imaginings I had in the 80s while playing games where you were a white square trying to find a key in a maze while lost in a caste rendered entirely by white lines. Feels like Ive been chasing those fantasies with every game Ive played since, and some have come close, but what From did with Elden Ring reminded me of that awe I felt as a kid and its easily my favorite game ever made.
Yes
its hard but so good
the only true 10/10 out there
praise the tarnished
all who waits for bloodborne pc
its a really easy game for people who are bad at games
It's Elden Ring, not sure what to say that others haven't. After struggling to get into the DS series with #3 I gave this a try and honestly it is near perfect. As long as you accept this is not a power fantasy, this is not a game that will make you feel good unless you earn it, it is one of the best games of recent years.
Excellent game. If you're playing a souls like for the first time make it this one.
Much gameage. Very game. Has much game in game
dark souls was better

el mejor juego del mundo gracias mama por haberme traido a este mundo en la epoca de eldenring

I like the game, but would be nice to have cross/platform, tried to play with a friend on his Ps5 but could not.
 FromSoftware's Magnum Opus.
great game
finally beat soldier of godrick :p
worst game so far i've tried, don't buy it, not worth the money unless you have a hilarious amout of time to play.

one of my favourite games! going back for my 3rd time.. give me the dlc for free ;) before i buy it lol
YES!
Up there among the best soulsbourn games. playing blind first time was peak gaming. the game does drag a little towards the end if you are exploring everything IMO but still not as bad a many other open world exploration games.

A must play.

Hands down the most amazing game ever made. IMO

very hard to learn but keeps me coming back to try again, big dopamine hit when i do something right

Amazing
 Despite its difficulty, the game offers more accessibility options, allowing varied approaches to challenges. Elden Ring masterfully blends dark fantasy with rewarding gameplay, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

Love the game, had a great experience with many emotions especially anger, good visuals, many learning curves witch I enjoyed and kept going because thats how life treats you and I think Im in to losing so I can keep going. Got way more then what I expected.
im in love 

What is not to love?  This game is awesome.  Large world, great bosses, beautiful setting, excellent game play, finished product - video gaming at its best.
game got good
I want to play more! MORE! GIVE ME THE DLC!!!
Good game, insanely overhyped and WAY too long.

Offsetting Lettuce's bad review hehehe
I can't figure out why this game is so popular. I've tried to give it a fair go, but the controls are absolute shit. I spend all my time trying to make the controls do what I want, which is neither fun nor a good challenge. I'm constantly baffled why the game refuses to do what I ask, and seems to do random stuff instead.
Very
I've never put so many hours into a game while it still feels fresh. And that's saying a lot because the game has been practically unchanged for 2 years now.
The PVP changes have made online play much more fun, and I expect the DLC to be amazing.
My steam hours are misleading, I have 1100 hrs on PS4.
Not my favorite fromsoft game, but the absolutely massive variety of builds and active pvp keeps me playing :).

Simply one of the most stunning games you could play. From an exploration standpoint, the map is huge, it doesn't do any justice to how much is acttually going on in the world. With a huge DLC update coming it's going to be even more unreal although I personally am going to wait to purchase until I'm much further in to the original game. 
10/10 - CHallenging but enjoyable and just beautiful to play. All around GOATED.
Brings back memories of dark souls one bloodborne sekiro basically combines all softwares best titles into one game 10/10
it's fun but dificult

I wish I owed this game.
Not even a souls game Fan this is one of the best games i have ever played.  I hated just having to bash my head against a boss is normal souls games.  So much to do and explore I could take a break and go do other things.
Elden Ring is one of those things that you should use the word epic to describe, despite its modern internet usage, calling it grandiose is selling it short.
the aesthetic and difficulty of the game r fire. If you crying about it being hard you're a pussy

but I ain't complaining
foreskin duo worst boss ever. 

I want Melina to kill me irl.
Easy Anti-Cheat
elite

Must play must have must learn to get up and walk away..... before you snap something
It`s Elden Ring. if you don't know by now I can't help you.
gud
Masterpiece.
This is a poorly designed game.

 * Over world map designed to waste your time: the map is full of mile-high cliffs everywhere. You'll fast-travel to a spot next to where you want to go, immediately run into a cliff, pick a direction to follow it around, and then after spending five minutes traveling in the opposite direction you'll go back and try the other direction for several minutes, and then give up and fast travel to some random spot somewhere totally else and ride for 3-4 minutes on your horse to get there. This happens all the time.

 * Encounter difficulty may as well be randomly generated: the moment you start the game you get splattered by a mid-game boss. Then after finishing the tutorial, you get immediately splattered by yet another boss hanging outside the newbie area. Meanwhile, 20 hours into the game and I'm still finding one-shottable trash mobs in higher levels zones that I just ride past and ignore because they don't give enough xp to matter. Why couldn't I have had some of those in the newbie area and why is the game wasting my time with them later on? And the ACTUAL early game bosses are so well hidden that you'll probably never find most of them without looking them up online and riding 3-5 minutes to get to them, maybe riding past a DRAGON to get to them, and then after you do this a couple times you'll stop bothering because they don't drop anything that matters.

 * Terrible itemization: Most items in the game have no reason to exist. 2% drop rate items from mobs that are worse that your new character starting gear, vendors that sell things you'll never use, a crafting system that will overfill your screen with materials for random useless things you'll never make, resistance items you'll have forgotten about by the time you find anything that does that type of damage, armor and weapon upgrades that don't matter because their bonuses are so small that it still takes exactly the same number of hits to die or kill anything. Sometimes whether you're wearing your best gear or playing naked, it just doesn't make much difference.

 * Ridiculous fake difficulty everywhere: traps in low-level areas that teleport you INSIDE of mid-game dungeon and disable your fast travel so you either delete the character and start over or check online for videos showing the path to get out and then do corpse runs for 10 minutes hoping to get lucky and have stuff miss you while you run out. Stuff mixed in with mobs you can easily fight, but oops THAT ONE can one-shot you and now it's time to do another corpse run. Weird stupid things like, if you get hit while on horseback, your horse stops running to give enemies time to kill you, stuff that kills you while you're looking at menus, artillery blasts that shoot from off-screen and can one-shot you, mobs so big that you can't see what they're doing because their butt in in your face and their weapon is offscreen behind you and of course the game doesn't let you zoom out, etc.

 * The core, central difficulty of the game comes from one thing: any time anything happens, YOUR CONTROLS STOP WORKING. Swing your sword? Can't do anything until the animation finishes. Get hit? Can't do anything until the recoil animation finishes. Get knocked off your horse? You almost have time to take a drink while you wait to stand up. And the game is completely full of these stupidly long windup and cool down animations, so you start an attack, but oops the boss stated his next move at the same time and he's faster than you so his attack will land before yours...so you mash the block key 2-3 times, but NOTHING HAPPENS because your character is stuck in an animation and dies even though you the human at the keyboard reacted in time to hit block several times, but the game just ignores you. This is the PRIMARY CORE MECHANIC of Elden Ring: waiting for animations to finish.

 * Bad port with terrible controls: Who in their right mind thought that w-f-left shift-mouseclick was a good key command for a jumping attack? What about the fact that you can't CLICK ON THE MAP to select a fast travel destination? Instead, you either vertically scroll through a list to find the name of the spot, or use wasd to scroll the map, the f to say you want to go to a spot then e to select the spot. Whoever made this has never played a PC game before, and it's like they were throwing darts of the keyboard to choose commands. Why does g bring up the map, not m? And while some of it you can remap, some of it you can't. I played for over 20 hours not knowing how to RUN because there's no key or mouse you can click to run. Instead, you have to press your dodge key...but keep holding it down for a second or so until you start running. Standing next to a message on the ground, but you're on horse back? Horses have a minimum move distance, so you tap a key to move, but you move past the thing, then turn around and tap the key again and still don't land close enough to read the message. Want to use an item you have hotkeyed? No problem, just press 2, 2, 2, over and over to scroll through the list of items you have hotkeyed, then R to use it, then 2 to get back to the original item. You can't hotkey an item to a number. The controls are just bad.

 * Even when you win, it's not fun: this isn't an action RPG. You don't "play" Elden Ring like a game. Instead, you pick an area, and then simply spam die in it over and over learning the specific move sets of the mobs that live there, trial-and-erroring your way through to figure out what the "correct" thing to do is in response to whatever action they pick from their move list. And they don't telegraph well. Sometimes it's HARD even to distinguish one of their moves from another. Like, is he going to do the exact same lead up and stab two times, or the same lead up and stab three times? If you react after two, you get hit by the third stab. But if you anticipate the third stab and don't attack, maybe he only stabs twice, then it's too late and you go back to waiting for an opening. Sometimes they'll start a move...but then if you react in a certain why they'll CHANGE their move to something else. So gameplay is about memorizing these awful combinations of, if boss does this, you do this, and then if they do A you do B but if they do C you do D. And if you're off by a quarter of a second, you just die sometimes because they do so much damage. A lot of stuff will kill you in two hits and some will kill you in one. You can be two minutes into a boss fight thinking you're going to win, but then oops, you were off by quarter of a second or misjudged one attack for another, so too bad, you're dead, start over. Typically when you find a new boss, you die instantly, then it's 2 minutes of reloading and running back only to die instantly again...over and over until you learn a couple responses to their moves so you can survival to a couple seconds...then 30 seconds...then eventually after an hour of this you're able to beat the boss. Sometimes. Or you might just give up and come back 20 levels later and STILL not be able to beat it. But when you finally do...it doesn't feel like "yay! I beat the boss!" It feels like "FINALLY IT'S OVER." 

That's what this game is. "Finally, it's over." Do you want to feel that over and over? If yes, buy Elden Ring. If not, buy something else.

I played this game on PS5 and then bought it on PC to get ready for expansion. Great game, 9.8/10.
The feeling of achievement goes hard!
no ultrawide support and EAC is a bit of a joke but definitely an incredible game
Extremely large game with tons of play styles and builds. lots of acheivements you can obtain through just playing the game.
7/10
Honest I was so bored of gaming and didn't really play anything. This is the Game that turned all that around. Loved it so much i dropped $1500 on a PC
shit slaps harder than my dad when hes drunk

boring
dang, you spent a lot of money on this? well, maybe you like it and maybe you don't. BUT, what more could you need than a souls game like this? The fighting, the weapons, the bosses, the EVERYTHING, EVEN A DLC THAT'S COMING. Tons can happen here.
The best game I have ever played. It is the pinnacle of the souls series from truly passionate and talented developers.
Literally the best game of all game

mr. ring, lemme tell you something. i got a lot of bling and my sword goes like ching ching
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE PLAYED IN LONG TIME!
I like killing

This game is a staggering achievement and the pinnacle of a legendary franchise. It's amazing...just....fek'n buy it and play it.
GAMBE TOO HARD IM LEVEL 120 AT DRAGONIC TREE SENTINEL I HAVE BEEN AT THIS SHIT BOSS FOR 3 WEEKS AFTER KAI CENATS PLAYTROUGH INSPIRED ME TRASH GAME TRASH BOSS
It is very realistic. To Prove that, I quote WHITE MASK VARRE:
'' However you are MAIDENLESS ''
Very mean, but realistic
It has to be the best game I have played
Open world: Huge, very creative environments, maybe a bit repetitive and empty at times.

Combat: Not much improved over DS3; wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle. 

Quests: Abysmal quest design, no logs and very vague instructions most of the time. It was cool in Dark Souls but it gets overwhelming with so many quests going on simultaneously in an open world.

Bosses: The absolute worst in Souls history. Using spirit ashes makes them trivial, not using them is just beyond unpleasant. There were a few I liked, but most needed you to learn obnoxious mechanics, delayed attack combos, etc., instead of forcing you to learn game mechanics like the bosses in Sekiro. 


Amazing game. my first playthrouth was on the PS5 but had to get it on steam it was worth it.
THE GOAT
It's good.
FIRST SOULS GAME IVE PLAYED THAT I 100%, ONE OF MY FAVS
good enough
Its Elden Ring, Do I have to even explain why its a masterpiece!

easy make it harder
Probably the best game in the last 10 years if not all time
As epic as everyone says it is
epic game dlc coming soon
Most negative reviews on this game = Skill issue...
ITS FUN
Immaculate game I used fucking Abe Lincoln to beat the shit out of demi gods is was great.
Incredible work of art. In my opinion the most accessible soulsbourne game just because you can pretty much make the game as hard as you want. Instead of adding a difficulty option like most other games, they add features like summons and more powerful weapons, as well as making level grinding allot faster. The bosses are generally well designed and challenging. My favorite bosses would be Morgott, Godfrey (both versions), Godrick and of course the hardest boss of them all Rick Soldier Of God. Although some bosses are pretty frustrating and badly designed like Godskin Duo and especially Elden Beast who is also unfortunately the final boss of the game. There is also The Fire Giant who serves as a major roadblock in skill, however i do not think he is badly designed. Most of his attacks are learnable, and not too terrible to dodge, it's just the absurd amount of health and absolutely terrible camera system,which always seems to be a detriment to me during bossfights with large enemies like Fire Giant, Elden Beast and most dragons. Another difficult boss is Malenia, the hardest boss n the game and widely hated for her incredibly bullcrap attacks that hit like a truck. I have not beaten her, however i think her attacks are very learnable and not as downright rng based as Elden Beast. Oh and also this game takes allot of inspiration from Berserk which is amazing. And also there is a weapon known as Darkmoon Greatsword, which is a direct reference to The Moonlight Sword from King's Field, one of my favorite franchises (which you should deffinetly play, they are awesome games also made by Fromsoftware). This game has incredible potential for a perfect game, however some bosses are just straight up badly designed. I give Elden Ring a 9/10. Elden Beast can suck my dick.

Praise The Sun!
It's definitely one of the best games ever made. So, it's a must try. if you haven't done it already.
Great game

Masterpiece of an open world. Tough but fair. Be patient and shits dope
This game is the pinnacle of humanity.It is so skibidi and malenia is such a bop.
fire giant other than that pretty good game
One of the best games I've ever played. The replayability is off the charts.
Goated
W game should very much play if you have played the souls games. Very difficult but very fun. the freeroam is amazing and should be explored to its top.
slept on it for awhile 

GOAT shit now
bhj n
this game will make you swear like a sailor, while keeping you glued to your computer for hours and hours. It is beautiful from a graphics point of view, and the fights are very satisfying and reward skill, while punishing mistakes mercilessly. Recommended.
peak.
this game hell.
Great game. I won't be the first to tell you it has a steeper learning curve than many games, but its absolutely worth powering through and getting gud.
Best game I've ever played in my life, I constantly think about this game. Literally my roman empire.
Everything
nice
I recomend this game to people that like open world games. You will always have things to do and it requires skill
best game everrrrrrr
been playing ever since release best game and dlc will be even better way to go fromsoft youve done it again ^^ takeing everyones souls and envigerating them keep them comeing i would like a berserk souls like in my opinion super dark super gory story rich worthy of a black swordsmen and all its fellow fans
took 3 blinkers and played the gaame the game was good.
Play it!
Amazing game
Simply peak
good
FROM Software proving again how games can be phenomenal experiences while respecting the intelligence and capabilities of players while not using underhanded tactics to access our wallets.
is good
Simply the best game ever made
Most accessible From Software game.
A visual masterpiece of gaming art. A goddess like creation of unparalleled beauty. Lore and dialogue which soothes the soul with a soft and tender tongue. Music and audio which caresses the senses like windswept opium. Character creation which makes an artist out of the gamer giving them the power to create a character of perfection incarnate with tones straight out of a 1970's fantasy magazine ala HEAVY METAL, VAMPIRELLA, CREEPY/EERIE etc.

Unfortunately Souls style games are not for me. Too frustrating for someone like me who is more into The Elder Scrolls and Larian rpgs. So i will leave this positive review because if the combat had been more SKYRIM or even third person turn based this would have been one of my TOP THREE GAMES OF ALL TIME! and a game to be played for ALL TIME!!!
I killed a bunch of disabled people with the dragon slayer sword from Berserk while butt booty naked (except for the frog mask on my head)
W
I got it completed 100% on ps4 and still enjoy it now on pc

The best game ever.
that feeling when you defeat the boss that have killed you many times is... DAMN GOOD
Who ok‚Äôd these fucking birds during play testing?! 
Didn‚Äôt think they could make a more annoying enemy then dogs but looks like I was wrong
Its beautiful.
good
good
Love it
just play it
Needed a game that was easy enough for my 2 year old daughter, and this was it, a fun, casual game you can just zen-out with. Love it!
nice game
too fucking long miyazaki. good game tho
Malenia is easy just use mimic tear, are you stupid?
Good game!
Great game, has more pleasurable hours of my life than any other game. Even though I have more hours on other games this one is more rewarding and entertaining than anything else because of its mostly fair combat. Fuck Fire Giant tho
Very difficult and also very rewarding. Great scenery great story so far. gonna be a time dump but worth it

Might be the greatest game I ever played.
-
One of the best souls series games, i am constantly trying to get friends to play it lol. definitely a must have and i cant wait for the dlc
dope for masochists. Not chill at all, just pure pain and pleasure. Love the struggle!
good game. High recommended
This game reminds me of Morrowind as a kid. A huge bizarre world with confusing quests and scary monsters. Legendary. One of the best ever.

My first soulslike game and it's been a blast. Great scenery and encounters. Much to explore, overall an awesome game.
One of the best games ever made. So good that it's a little difficult to enjoy other similar games after playing it.
try the co-op mod fellas, it just makes the game more fun
Defeating bosses solo gives me religious experience
i like
I hugged a woman for the first time in my life
Extremely clunky UI that was not really adapted for MnK in any way, Really slow combat, with both animation lock and action queuing. And last but not the least absolutely the worst camera in any game or application I have ever experienced. Great game that gets absolutely ruined by this.
it made my dick hard
great game
infuriating game. excellent.
Amazing
Elden Ring I've never played a game like it before, Elden Ring is the best game I've ever played

One of the best games I have played; it is better than Skyrim; it is not close. This was my first Souls like game I've ever played and it was worth every penny and second spent.
At this point, I don't even think I have to say anything.

best game till day
There is a lot to do in this game. And, on the surface, that sounds great for the average player. But for those who are true fans of the dark souls franchise, and expecting an experience similar to that, I feel like Elden Ring falls short.

The core experience of playing this game is completely different from previous titles. The open-world nature of the game, boundless consumable items/pickups, cooking???, bell-bearings and all similar nonsense simply is not in line with the dark souls experience.

As a mage build I cannot state how disappointing it was to find that Glintstone Pebble, the starting spell, is the best spell in the game until around 60+ INT (unless you happen to find the Meteorite Staff and Rock Sling--which even then, is a slow situational spell, which only works well in open space.) Leveling up staffs and weapons is extremely tedious. Instead of ending at +10 or +15, normal weapons are upgradeable to +25 in this game. That may give you an idea of how absolutely massive this game is and how long it takes to complete. (I will admit that this was my first time playing a magic build in any souls game, and my experience might have been different with another build.)

I found myself entirely sick of the experience and wanting to quit multiple times. Your game should not feel like a slog to complete. But that is inevitably what happens in these open world games. There is simply too much content. If you are not motivated to simply explore the map aimlessly, with no clear benefit to progression, you probably won't like this game.
im bad at this game but thats what keeps me going
Amazing. I don't think I've ever played a game that does open world as good as this. The game gives you an abundant amount of freedom and it's addictive to go out and explore.

Having a Map to collect for each area is a great touch, I really enjoyed opening the map and placing markers on things that looked like buildings or caves that usually led to a dungeon or a treasure chest.

Combat is challenging but fun with a staggering amount of viable weapons and spells which open up a lot of interesting builds.

The bosses are where this game shines and I can safely say fromsoft has kept the quality high.

The world feels alive, plenty of enemy variety while exploring and the NPCs have excellent dialogue that are voice acted well.

The lore and story building is a double edged sword, it does help with immersion but I had no idea what happening with the story and following NPC questlines was a nightmare. I eventually had to search online to get these answers.

I would say this is one of the 'easier' fromsoft games as you have many options to tackle a situation, such as summons, coop and builds that let you cheese bosses. 


Yeahhhh it's pretty good I guess
really challenging
Obviously, I'd recommend the 2022 Game of the Year. They don't need my help to prove they've made an incredible game. They did that all by themselves.
„Åù„Çå„ÅåÊú¨Êù•„ÅÇ„Çã„Åπ„ÅçÂßø„Å†
Just a beginner, very hard to play cause im inconsistent at playing at. But god damn, that game is beautiful. In every way.
Petry cool

Good gajme
This is my first souls game and its the first game i get all the 42 achievements. the map in this game is so big so you'll never get bored f exploring. The game may be hard at first and the bosses may see impossible to kill but they aren't. Once you start to explore and actually level up your stats the game doesn't seem impossible to beat. This game is easily one of my favorites and i'm excited for the DLC to come out.
hehehehehehehe
So many puppies want to play with you, a true haven for animal lovers!
Elden ring my favorite souls/borne (Maleketh is so dumb though)
I play this game way too much and this is the second copy of the game I have the first having at least 100 hours (prob more)
if you dont like this game you can say what you want but also its kinda a skill issue
i do prefer ds 1 and ds 3 but this is still great albeit the rage

I've been playing games for 20 years and this is the best game I've ever played. Absolutely amazing. Especially on first playthrough. Another perfect game from Fromsoftware (I never thought a game was perfect before Elden Ring and Sekiro). Easy 10/10
very good game

Game of The Gods
Great game overall, only missing a little more indication and flow to lead you from area to area...
very poggers yes
hella gangster
I guess you should play this.
fent nod
good
if you like dying and having to start over and a shitty battle system and muddy graphics this is the game for you. the battle system is that bad honestly but every time i'm getting the handle of it some OP bad guy shows up and kills me. this is not fun. fuck you elden ring
Fun game, first ever Eldin ring/darksouls whatever its called type of game pretty fair of an experience
This game is fun, definitely a thrill, but you will also feel frustrated a lot because you win through error and trial in your fights.
10/10
great game
Truly peak gaming. You don't even need to like Soulsborne games to enjoy this. Masterpiece.
I just love this game so much
Beautiful Masterpiece.

one of if not the best game ever made i hope everyone gets a chance to play this masterpiece thank you miyazaki
There aren't a lot of souls games I can get into, but Elden Ring definitely broke that streak for me. It's the first souls game I have played to completion multiple times and am looking forward to the new DLC.
100/100
good game
Good.
game is terrible
Absolutely amazing game.
Perfect.
Possibly the best RPG I've ever played, if you want a fun and challenging game with extremely free and diverse build creation then look no further than Elden Ring 10/10!
One of the best games with lots of replayability and tons of different builds
Game goog. Recommend.

try finger, but hole.
[h1] THIS GAME SUCKS [/h1]
No Maidens???
Best game ever
Fun
I really think this is a great game, like where do i even begin. Elden Ring has saved me from the depths of hell called earth. As iI immersed into the game, i start to become one with it, for i am now an Elden Lord, I am the Elden Ring, for the Elden Ring is me, thy Tarnished.
lit
great
This game is the best game you will play last year, this year, and next year. Probably beyond that.
I discovered the cure for cancer from this game. Def would recommend.
Is good

SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GOOD GAME, must perfect the art of the parry
Honestly I am not a huge fan of the combat but i like the challenges that come with it. The best part of this game is the exploration. The difficulty level makes the exploration that much more exciting because you are likely to run into a new enemy that is going to stomp you into the ground but then you get to come back to that same enemy later and return the favor. I hated the game and almost returned it in the first hour and a half but the revenge is so satisfying. I am about three monitors in and I think I am starting to like the game.
Amazing
A GAME ABOUT COCK RING
Went into the darkness and became a masochist for this game
Fuck Yes
This game is a MASTERPIECE!
By far one of the best souls games I've played.
iz gud
remove lake of rot
i still can't find the elden ring!!! where is it
You get a hug. 10/10
love the game, of course. but the fact that you let people invade beginner areas or even more, any areas whatsoever...I think it is BS. You put PVP in a PVE game, really? go play call of duty
Best rpg ever
peak game

help

Much fun but also much pain. Ranni gonna get it!
Best game I've ever played.
Best game
‚ù§Ô∏è One of the best if not the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
Why did I crush most of the bosses in this game? Why were there large portions of the map where enemies were no threat at all? Where overcoming adversity is the reward many people seek when playing a From Software game, exploration becomes a punishment, as it has the potential to diminish the challenge, through level-ups and resources, so greatly that exploration is the only engaging element left. 

This is to say, don't explore. Follow the trail to the big castle and if you feel too weak to take it on, head off and do a couple dungeons just to get strong enough. "What am I missing if I don't explore the open world?" you might think. As someone who found every single dungeon and item, it's not worth it. I don't believe you're meant to do everything in this game. So much of it is the same. Every dungeon looks the same and has the same bosses. You'll see them all at least twice even if you're not going for 100%.

The bosses in this game have the hardest attack patterns in any From Software game, and they're the easiest to beat. I did one attack for the whole game. I did a strength build with and ultra greatsword. These are a classic Dark Souls weapon that offer massive damage but have a slow attack speed. In this game, it doesn't matter what your weapon is, doing a jumping strong attack is just as quick and effective and I don't know why. Literally every enemy could be killed and even stunlocked by this strategy. The bosses would be so distracted by the skeletons that I summoned, that I could kill them in a minute by just doing jumping strong attacks on their back.

The game is divided into two parts. The open world filled with dungeons, and what Fromsoft calls a "Legacy Dungeon" which are long, semi-linear levels that exist in the open world but are very closed off from it. Basically your standard Dark Souls level. Had this game cut the open world completely and just stitched all of the Legacy Dungeons together, this game could have been outstanding. This is not coming from a place of nostalgia because this is the first From Software game I played and beat. It just seems like every new thing they tried was detrimental to the formula they've been using.
The greatest game ive ever played it changed my life, honestly 10 out 10 abusive relationship

glad another masterpiece didn't lose to God of war
Didn't expect death.
Undoubtedly a masterpiece.
10/10
Brah game hard AF
If you thumb up this review I won't do a damn thing because those pathetic grabs for attention are just that. This is perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. You probably know that. If you didn't now you do just do yourself a favor and buy it. Best art and design in perhaps the entire history of gaming.

fun game very adventure like game
Elden Ring is a master class in how to write, build, and bring to life a world from beyond the realm of video games. It's more of a book come to life than it is a game all of it's own, and with it's DLC coming out in just a few weeks Id figure it's due time I put together my thoughts on how Elden Ring stands up to the rest of FromSoftwares titles. 

(Spoiler Warning) ....at least for someone with only 40 hours in.


If someone on the street were to come up to me and ask "How would you describe Elden Ring in a single sentence?" I would probably tell them "It's as if Darksouls wrote a book and then made it into a video game.". No seriously I cant state that enough. The lore on display here and the world building is some of the best the teams ever created, and the fact it's an actual free roaming open world only tops the cake. Clearly having a world class writer helped the team flush this story out, but also the merge of the two almost feels seemless. I can't tell who honestly would have created or inspired whom, other than of course the combat mechanics.

Speaking of combat is just the same as it always has been. For good or for worse it's nothing revolutionary. Having sometimes a "steed" companion helps and changes the way some battles are fought, but overall It feels and acts very darksouly, all be it better made. Attempts clearly have been made to make certain aspects of previous titles fall in line with newer modern aspects, and as well previous problems the games have suffered from. One such thing is the class system which now feels robust in almost every way no matter who you choose to be. Faith, Magic, some guy with a club, it's all good here. 

Now as for me the entire grand scale and scope of the world just feels....insane. Dungeons feel real, catacomes feel like they should, fortresses are.....protected, and a pain to even try to invade. The aspects of the story and a recent massive climatic battle really tell in this game. The story fits the gameplay, and that's something wonderful. It's not just "We all are doing stuff for no reason.", no there is some serious thought to how the gameplay and the story intertwine. Probably given that the writer and the gameplay developers had their own jobs and merged together to make a wounderful sandwich. 

Anywho I think I'll leave this as a final note. The feeling that a writer and a gaming company can come together seemlessly like this is very telling. They both scream the same kind of "style", so I guess that's why the merging feels natural. Sometimes you can tell when something major shows up in a continual gaming company like FromSoftware that changes are too much and too obvious to feel like one or the other has taken proper root. Sometimes they just do one of too much, other times they just fail to feel it's consistant or coihernt. Either way this isn't the case here. In fact I hope they continue to do this, my god it's a must now.


So should you play Elden Ring? Yes, if you like Darksouls or nearly anything FromSoftware makes. It screams that, but now has the fantastic addition of feeling like your walking into an actual real life story book. And for me, that's just too good to pass up on. 
One of my fav games of all time. This is the stuff of dreams, PERFECTION!

I had this on launch, pre order and was doing the countdown until it unlocked. obviouxly beat the game, beat 99.9% of the bosses, reached over level 350+ lol and farmed alot. that battle with Malenia was EPIC.

Can't wait for Shadows of Erdtree !
Margit isnt shit
good
I think it is psychologically impossible for me to write something bad about this game. Sure, it gets pretty difficult, but that's the point. Absolutely incredible work of art. I would name it game of the century.
I was amazed at this RPG. The world is HUGE and I've thrown so many temper tantrums, but dear God it was worth it.
i'm still ass at this game
as a first time souls player, it's really not too hard but a healthy challenge. be ready for multiple YouTube guides

TL;DR This is among one of the greatest games ever made, but it also sucks

I am reminded yet again that this is a disgusting DEX agenda/propaganda game. Everything heavier than a greatsword is absolute dogwater, if you want to use colossal weapons you have to dual wield and spam jump attacks which is one of the most boring ways to play the game. Even outside of heavy STR weapons, the meta is spamming Ash of War attacks, so whatever you choose it's always going to be braindead gameplay. You can choose not to do either of those things which is what I did in my 1st and 2nd playthrough but you're opting for a much worse experience, forget even the possibility of ever beating Malenia with a standard 2H colossal weapon STR build. You either go for a disgusting build or you have a bad time. Don't even get me started on it overall having the worst designed bosses in the franchise and the trash open-world. Have to clean and sanitise my hands every time I play the degenerate gameplay involved in this game.

It's aight, I still like it but only because it is Souls. One of the worst Fromsoft games just above Dark Souls 2.

(This review started off as a meme about DEX being bent but thinking about it more really pissed me off so I decided to mini-rant. Elden Ring is an amazing game, it has some of the highest peaks but it also has the lowest lows in the series and imo the lows far outnumber the peaks, which means I have far more issues with this game than praises, if I were to rant about them all this would be a multi-page essay long review. At its core Elden Ring is still a souls game so it inherits the things the series is lauded for; the best level designs in the industry, the big wtf moments, the crazy high levels of intent placed into every thing in the games from enemy placement, item placements, lore, EVERYTHING to create an unending cinematic experience with no need for cutscenes or scripted gameplay and the fact that every where you look in the open world it looks like a painting. The game is amazing but my praises for this game end there, I believe it's one of the greatest games of all time, but its one of the worst Souls games, that's just how far above Souls games are in comparison to other games that I can be so critical of this game yet still consider it to be one of the best games ever made)
Love the game but there's a ton of bullshit "I WIN" mechanics from too many enemies that just kill the fun each play through. Anyways, drop in the ocean review.
Never been more suicidal. Then again never been more in love
good
The only other game that even comes to mind when I think "best game I have ever played" is KOTOR 2. They are obviously very different, but good stories are good stories.

As someone who has just played Dark Souls 1 a bit this was an amazing game. It was definitely more beginner friendly with its open world with awesome Boss Designs and probably a great story if you manage to piece it together
MADE BY ALIENS
I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing elden ring.
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing elden ring.
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours.
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing elden ring.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.
Oh Elden Ring,

As a gamer who enjoys both narrative-driven games and overall experiences, I've always thought that Souls-like games weren't for me because of their feared difficulty. That single aspect of it had blocked me from playing these games, but after seeing a couple of friends trying it out a year after its release and some YouTubers like Jev having a blast with it, I decided it was time.

I want to start this review by saying I don't regret taking so long to start my Souls experience because the Christmas break I spent trying it out was one of my best school breaks ever. Experiencing and exploring The Lands Between with friends guiding me through it, giving me both tips on what to get or where to go, and headaches, telling me to go to an area saying it would be fine, and I'd get hard-stuck on a tough boss. I haven't felt so free playing a game in a long, long time. I was able to grind and get the game's platinum in a matter of three weeks.

The world is vast and honestly one of the most beautiful and unique I've ever experienced. I was baffled by how FromSoftware managed to make it feel so lively and complete, even being as open as it is. There are a couple of dungeons where, yes, you notice they are very similar when it comes to their architecture, and also some NPCs that could get a little repetitive here and there, but that's just it, the game is HUGE. You don't feel like it gets repetitive unless you are really, REALLY picky with it, especially with its characteristic areas and cities that go from beautiful, calm, and peaceful places like Limgrave, to horrid, anxiety, and fear-inducing places like the Deeproot Depths. And I cannot say this enough, EVERY AREA IS JUST SO UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFULLY BUILT, and you will easily get to pick your favorites and just stay there forever, having fun, defeating bosses, solving dungeons, and interacting with the most interesting and deep NPCs. The Lands Between were an absolute joy to explore. Thank you, FromSoftware.

When it comes to the narrative, I must say, I was a little distracted, but after beating the game twice, I got curious about it, so I looked it up. The 3+ hour videos from fans explaining the game's lore, every main character's story, and it just, GETS, DEEPER! The main villains and NPCs like Malenia, Radahn, Ranni, and others have the most interesting backgrounds, and you just want to know more about them and about their relationship with other characters. But for me, the most interesting aspect of it all was your "teammates'" backstories and progress through your quests, like Blaidd and Alexander. How the game builds the sweetest characters, just to give them the saddest endings, all in your hands, is just heartbreaking. And you must appreciate when a game and its characters reach your heart like that.

To end it off, the mechanics and sound design. First off, the mechanics, they're exactly what you are expecting and what you would expect from a FromSoftware game, even from just watching YouTube videos like I did. The only difference is they're WAY more precise than what you'd think they'd be. As I said at the very beginning of this review, I've never played any Souls game, but I have to say this game got me HOOKED just by its mechanics at the very start. The way you can be specific with your builds, making them either 100% Dex or Faith or any other stat, or 50-50, or just go nuts with them. Giving players that amount of freedom just makes the game that much more enjoyable, and when you mix that with the most pleasurable fight mechanics I've touched on to this day (if you exclude FPS games like Counter-Strike), what you get is a very addictive chocolate cake of a game. The sound design adds to it all, bringing excitement to every fight and to every area with a specific theme. Nothing beats being stuck underneath Volcano Manor with Rykard, or in that heavenly arena with the Elden Beast, fighting for your life (and runes) while having the most amazing soundtrack playing in the background. It makes the experience that much better and more desirable.

What else is there to say? FromSoftware did nothing, absolutely nothing wrong with this game. From the immense yet complete world to its occupants, from the most diverse list of common enemies to the most unique and beautiful boss fights (mind you there are around 200 bosses, depending on who you ask), and from the most leg-shaking weapons to the most heartbreaking NPC quests, this game did it all. It absolutely overcame all my expectations and delivered the most enjoyable experience I've had in years. A pleasant surprise, and the start of what I hope will be a very, very long journey through FromSoftware's catalog and other Souls games.

Now all we have left to do is wait for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. The hype is real!

And for those too afraid of the game's difficulty, trust me, it will be worth it once you learn how to dodge and counter. The game is a wonderful experience I hope every game-lover out there has a chance to have.

Candidate 1 for Best Game of the 2020s
gud
KInda like fortnite
This game is a masterpiece, listing the pros would make the review very long so I'd just list the things I personally dislike. Play the game regardless.

Cons:

Repetitive fights. Regardless of what Steam says, I played the game before. I have like 100 hours and pretty much gone through most content of the game. A lot of bosses are reused throughout the game and it ruins the immersion and the joy of fighting in those cases. "Oh, lets see what's in this cave I've been exploring for 20 minutes. Oh, another godskin. Oh, more crystal dudes." Would 100% prefer the game trading not having as many encounters for a sense of more unique fights.

Balancing. The game can be really easy. Like not even trying easy (don't even get me started on the Mimic Tear Ashes). On the other hand, game can be really hard. Like you enjoy pain kinda hard. It all depends on your loadout/leveling choices. Sure you can make the game as hard as you want, but I'd prefer if all the weapons were closer together in terms of power level and leveling them didn't make that massive DPS difference. Most bosses are already balanced around all this options (not a lot of openings, constantly chasing you for ranged builds, really long range, 2-3 hits to kill you unless you level Vigor to 40) so a lot of fights end up feeling like DPS checks rather than learning the attack patterns of the bosses. I would personally enjoy experiencing longer fights and enemies doing less damage so you can actually learn those fights.

Again, the game is still a 9.5/10. Play it.

It is the year of our lord 2024 and you're making me get a mod for widescreen support. The game is already rendering in 1440x3440 but they made the genius move to artificially paste black bars on the sides of your screen.

HOLY SHIT

One of the best RPGs out there
TOGETHAAAA!!
come on its elden ring
killed mogh and had to fight him again because i died to bloodloss before i got the achievement

Git gud
10/10 
The game looks incredible and the gameplay is lots of fun. This is by far the most welcoming souls game, but its by no means easy. Bosses will take multiple deaths to beat, but they are necessary to learning its patterns. The open world means that you can always come back to bosses if you think you need to level up more or get better gear.
Elden Ring quickly became one of if not my Favorite Game of all time. The lore, Enemy design, weapon options, beautiful, awe inspiring world. This game leaves me inspired and obsessed every time I login.
genuinely my favorite game ever and my first 100% game, a lil too easy to 100% in my opinion though, looking forward to the dlc

Hey everyone, it's Caillou! I just started playing Elden Ring, and I wanted to share my thoughts on this amazing game!

Visuals and World Design
Wow, just wow! The world of Elden Ring is so big and beautiful. It‚Äôs like stepping into a huge, magical storybook! There are forests, castles, and so many cool places to explore! The graphics are super pretty, and there's so many things to do! It's like each day is something new!

Gameplay and Combat
The controls are really easy! And everyone has been super nice so far, so I haven't had to do any combat! When I started the game I was in this strange building, but when I came out I saw a bunch of shiny things on the ground! They told me to jump but I didn't! Then I saw a scary spider! I was so scared, but then the ground crumbled and I fell down. I hurt my knee and I almost cried but then this nice lady on a pony said some stuff and it made me feel better! Then I rode the elevator and opened the doors and it was so pretty! There was this guy in a mask and he was really nice. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers but I didn't know where to go so he helped me. I asked him what I should do and he said that the best choices he ever made were made-on-lists! I thought a list was a great idea but I didn't have any paper.  I think I'll ask the guy on the horse next! He looks friendly!

Story and Characters
The story is like a big mystery. You find out more by talking to characters and reading items you find! Sometimes I have to sound out the letters but I can do it! It can be a bit confusing, like when there was a message that said "If only I had a giant...But hole!" I didn't know what that meant. But I like putting the pieces together, like a puzzle! The characters you meet are really interesting, and some are kind of scary! I think it might be Halloween here! I hope there's some candy!

Difficulty and Challenge
Elden Ring is tough, but you shouldn't be scared! I used to be a afraid of dogs but then I let one lick me and I like them now! I'm going to do the same thing for all the new animals I meet here! It‚Äôs a game that makes you feel proud of yourself when you overcome the challenges! Like when I didn't know where to go but I found a glowing tree and it was that way! And some of the people who have been here aren't that good at knowing animals yet. I saw a turtle and someone called it a dog! How silly! 

Overall Experience
I'm having so much fun playing Elden Ring. It‚Äôs a game that takes you on an epic adventure and makes you feel like a superhero or a knight! If you love exploring big worlds, solving mysteries, and making new friends, you should definitely play Elden Ring! I'm gonna go say hi to my new friend now, I think he's waving at me!

best game ever addicted to it maoadadamskpdasdopiapdakdadad
Solid long term buy. Wait for it to go on sale, but it's still worth full price.
amazing game, even better in coop in my experience! loved it a lot, deserved all the awards it got
One of the best video games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Highly recommend.
Its Dark Souls 4 with open world and a new jump Button
I NEED MORE
game is amazing fuck u for invading

git gud
Miyazaki does not miss
It's a great game, and if it's your first step into the souls series it's as good as start as any. 
As far as the souls games in whole, this game has the best exploration by far and its not even close. 
For negatives, the bosses in this game are it's weakest component. There's a lot of re-fights with the same boss to the point where it just felt lazy. The bosses are hit or miss and I want to say like 75% being misses, I think ds1-2 and 3 had a better boss line ups. 
It's an easy recommend and if you like it you should for sure check out ds1 and 3, maybe 2 if you really want to but its known as the black sheep of the family.
Every few years a game gets it hooks in me and I put hundreds of hours into it. This is one of those game for me.

I played it for a few hours and it felt overwhelming so I put it down. I came back to it a year later and something clicked and there was no turning back.

I have beat the game 4 times on my main character. I will start playing again very soon to get ready for the new expansion for the game.

The graphical design of the game is very unique to From software. If you have played any of their previous games you will feel at home.

People talk about how hard these games are but really they are as hard as you decide it needs to be. You can summon NPCs to help you out and you can summon a mimic which is a copy of yourself. So for many of the boss fights you have plenty of help.

This was the first From software Souls like game that clicked with me and now I‚Äôm going back and playing all of them. I finished Dark Souls 1, tried 2 but it felt weird, and now I‚Äôm playing through Dark Souls 3 which I really like. I‚Äôll play Bloodborne or Sekiro next.

Do yourself a favor and buy this game now. It‚Äôs the best game I have played in years. The only one that is near it in terms of bang for your buck is Zelda: Tears of the Kingsom

you will break a keyborde butt it`s fun
Good game
Why are you reading this review? You already know what the game is at this point.
god hates us all
fun game
I love this game!
prepare to cry
Peak gaming but difficult so if your're not looking for a challenge don't buy this
i also thought i wouldnt like games this style because i play fps games, but this game is fooking amazing
Before he could grow the Haligtree to its full potential, Miquella was stolen away by Mohg, Lord of Blood, in his cocoon form. Mohg wished to have Miquella elevated to godhood with himself as Miquella's consort.

Consort - A husband or wife, especially the spouse of a monarch. 

Mohg is freaky bro.
it's moghin time
Shit was good

Only complaint I really have is I wish the multiplayer was more user friendly.
Incredible
elden bing good
like it
hard
I enjoyed being fucked so much using the pirated version, that I ended up buying it.
Killed god with a big stick
A culmination of all of what Fromsoftware has learned from the Souls trilogy. Some of the best combat and scenery in all of gaming. It does have some glaring issues - My main problem with the game comes from how slow it can be to get a character going on subsequent playthroughs when you already have an idea of what you want to do and where you want to go. Still an amazing game through and through.

The DLC will make this game better than it already is. It's a little lacking for me, but I know the DLC will fix that.
Game is great but watch vids before you hop in or you'll be discouraged to play it. you'll be lost at the begging so find a guide video for the first part of the game.
Dark Souls 4 is good
good
Tip: Though you can ignore pretty much all aspects of the game if you really want to, it is best enjoyed if you make an attempt to engage with all of them. These aspects include: crafting, multiplayer/invasions, lore, and exploration

Best game - ever.

Elden Ring is a game that you cannot just pick up for an hour and then review it, if you truly want an experience out of this sixty USD, break out of your comfort zone and learn to get good at the game, do a full play through without skipping dialog and you will open yourself up to a game that is beyond measure
My Love.
Good game, very not easy.
‚Äé
Great gameplay, if things too hard just grind a little and you'll get there, its all about knowing when to approach things, and how to approach them, if need summons, summon, if need torrent, use torrent, there isn't a reason why even a casual player shoudn't be able to enjoy the game unless they get consumed on the spectrum of souls players that pride in suffering the game as if its the only concept of the game, its more patience than suffering, and more calculation than relying on RNG.
She crumbling on my farum til I azula
Don't play this game, too addicting
Mid game
Gonna make me cry ngl
ive died to every single boss more than a 100 times. Great game, Love it.
good game
Got new Graphics card for Elden Ring Dlc, now Malenia can beat my ass in 2k with max settings and rtx.
Would recommend 10/10.
Such a good game!
fun
The is only the begininng.
it‚Äôs elden ring
 A brilliant game, spectacular surreal visuals
Good game, played something like 150 hours in the first 3 weeks while working full time so didn't sleep all that much.

The game looks good, sometimes the controls are jank but most of the time they're alright and it's my fault I died. Sometimes you might get stuck in a wall, on a piece of debris, in/under the ground or on a speck of dust, but most of the time you don't.

I was unfortunate enough to suffer random freezes that weren't graphics related, which mostly happened when playing multiplayer. It felt more like a CPU related issue than anything else and I have a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core Processor which I thought should be able to handle this without any issues but that wasn't the case. However the freezes are less frequent and less harsh when playing alone so that was aight I guess.

Regarding the game and gameplay itself, I'm new to the genre but after this I wan't to look back at the previous Fromsoft titles. 
Bosses were mostly fun and interesting, the story was interesting but the lack of direction or at least some minimal amount of logging makes tracking them stupid difficult which is dumb and I don't care what anyone else says you should be able to keep some track of where you are in a given quest with a world that large.

Its Elden Ring...
best game i've ever played by far
I hate to be that guy... but Elden Ring literally saved my life. I used to be a Drug Addict. I still am but now I have Dung and Game Addiction.

ONION RING
This game was my first true Soulsborne game; I'd played a bit of DS3 a couple years prior but did not progress enough for it to count. To be brief, this game is the origin of my love of the genre. The feeling of these games is addictive, my ADD loves the dopamine release from throwing myself at a boss again and again, learning a bit more each time until victory has achieved. Naturally there were times that highlighted the durability of my controller, but the best part of this game is learning to appreciate every boss with subsequent playthroughs (expect for space worm, you know what you did). I also appreciate how accessible the game is to new players; while summons may be "controversial" (please just touch glass and let people play how they wanna play), I appreciate their existence in giving me the support I needed early on before I became confident enough to start doing solo playthroughs. I also had a blast playing with friends, though the invasion mechanic was annoying at times.

Naturally there are still some issues I have with this game. The final boss fight could have been a lot better had the only kept the first part, made Marika the second part or at the very least gave us access to the least coordinated horse in existence. Pvp is also as unenjoyable as ever but thats pretty much a staple of these games. Questlines can also be hard to keep track of in your first playthrough which some players could find punishing should they forgo the use of wikis.

Overall this is a fantasitc game and introduction to the genre; I look forward to seeing what they have cooked up for the dlc.
√âtant rapidement frustr√© et √©nerv√© sur les jeux vid√©o (un gros rageux ouais) j'avais un peu peur de me lancer dans Elden Ring comme premier souls ! Mais j'avais encore plus peur de passer √† c√¥t√© d'un chef d'≈ìuvre. 
Eh bien si vous √™tes comme moi je peux vous assurer que vous aller adorer ! Une fois fini je n'ai eu qu'une envie c'√©tait de le relancer pour faire le jeu avec un autre style d'arme, d'autres armures etc ! Tout est super, l'environnement, les doublages, les chara design, les musiques ! 
Je mettrais un bon gros 19/20 car il y a quelques petites choses dans le jeu assez absurdes dans l'ergonomie et/ou la difficult√© sur certains passages (je parle pas de la waterfowl dance de Malenia hein pas du tout) ! Mais √ßa repr√©sente vraiment 1% de tout le jeu donc √ßa ne m'a absolument pas emp√™ch√© d'adorer le jeu !
√áa m'a m√™me donn√© envie de me faire les autres souls ! Souhaitez moi bonne chance !
STAY SAFE.
This is a game that requires you to be patient and get used to its weird and creepy world. At first, it may seem unordered, chaotic and aimless but this is how it is supposed to be. The game aims to make you feel out of place and lost, because that is what being tarnished means.

However, once you get used to the world and start to get goals little by little, its world takes you in. Your feebleness at the start gradually disappears and you start feeling more powerful in both in-game and IRL, where you hone your dodging, defending and attack timing skills. 

The world holds many secrets, some lead to alternate endings, some lead to well written stories, mostly in tragedy. Death, misery and fury are all part of this twisted world. Once you get used to it and dying, getting up and trying again, ultimately achieving victory, this game will reward you. 

The story, the customization, the design, the sounds, the quotes, everything is amazing in this game. I don't know if it is the greatest Souls game ever made, but it is certainly one of the best RPGs out there. Be patient for the first 10 hours of confusion and you won't regret it.

THE best souls game out there. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. Immense replay ability. Simply put. A good game.
get gud scrub
one of my favorite games
This game is ludricrously good. I stayed my distance from it for AGES because I thought there was some sort of penalty for dying - and I thought I'd get into a death spiral and stay a weak baby the whole time. But nah, you just drop your currency where you die, and as long as you take a second at the start of the fight you died at to reclaim that currency, there's no penalty to dying. 

It's the ultimate power fantasy, built upon a pile of your own bones.
I love this kind of game !! Challenge ! RPG ! Lore ! Fighting style ! 
A lot of weapon and special move of them with Deep machanical to calculate for fun of your own style. :)))
W update
I mean, what I can I say that hasn't been said before.  Like all FromSoftware titles, if you stick with it, it's extremely rewarding.  However, it's punishing at times.  It can be so punishing, for me at least, at times, making me want to quit.  To sum it up simply, there is a lot to learn, a lot to do, a lot to explore, A LOT of frustration, A LOT of strategy, and A LOT of fun!  I love it!
The world is so amazing. I literally beat the game and then spent another 30 hours just exploring the things that I missed and the locations that I didn't go to. The scale of some of the locations is just wild. I just wish that the final boss would be a bit less annoying and frustrating.
fun
Changed my perspectives on games forever. Truly incredible.
mmm dog
Its a cinematic masterpiece
Perfect.
Do i even need to write a review? This is literally elden ring.

Birth is pain, life is pain, death is pain.

Its fun but ive died to the fire giant at least 200 times. HELP
LOVE IT

Wait for dlc
BEST STORY MODE GAME EVER MADE PERIOD. MALIKETH IS SEXY AF. MALENIA IS EASY AF.
I like the game but too many bugs and controller issues
great game best i've played
its ok i guess
I'm not even half way through, and I want to replay it
This is a bad open world game, and it is first and foremost an open world game. I had to have a wiki open the entire time because of the countless NPC questlines that offer no guidance, have obtuse requirements, and often get completely locked out by progressing the main questline. All of the content sprinkled across the continent is just one of a few repeated things, reusing stronger but unremarkable enemies as bosses by just buffing their stats, and sometimes there's two of them, or there's some chump enemies in the arena too - and that in particular gets frustrating. NPCs are so flat and lifeless in every regard except most of the dialogue, given they're so generically animated and never move from their spot unless they're teleporting somewhere new without any indication where they've went.

The stuff that FromSoft have experience with is the stuff that shines. The unique bosses are very memorable. The combat is well-balanced and rewarding. There's a lot of different sorceries, incantations (both of which are magic, but one is intelligence and one is faith), armament types, armors, and weapon skills available, and that's all quite fun. The aesthetics are gorgeous.

I just wish I could play with these combat mechanics, and enjoy these environments, in a better game.
The real Shattering is the friends we made along the way.
gud
No more stalling, gonna finish this before dlc comes out!
Im no longer maidenless :3
Great game. Having a bit of trouble with it lagging a lot. It didn't for the first time I played. Didn't play for a couple of days and when I came back, it is so laggy I can't play. I have a high end pc and it ran it perfectly at first. what happened??
good game

beautiful game

Great game! Offers play styles and challenges for whatever you like! Warrior of the Light!!
i do it for ranni.
best game
This is hands down. Fromsoftware's best work yet. If you are a fan of dark fantasy and don't own this game, you're missing out.
First souls-like I've tried. Didn't think I would like it, as I normally play games on a rather low difficulty, but it has been a fun challenge. If you stick with it, I think you'll enjoy it even if challenging games aren't normally your thing.
Mastapeach
I haven't been so invested in a game like I am now since minecraft.
Peak
i like elden ring because i can be a mage and still feel whats its like to get my butt beat like a swordsman 11/10
Burn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.

Ahhh, may chaos take the world! 

MAY CHAOS! TAKE! THE WORLD!
yeahhhh
Really REALLY tried to like it, but it overstays its welcome by a long shot.
I could force myself to finish it but one time. At numerous subsequent attempts I gave up less than half way through.
The few unique zones and bosses were fantastic, but the reused fights, locations, and the vast, formulaic regions were severely wanting.
Honestly my favorite game ive ever played and im more off a shooter game type of person but i honestly LOVE this game sosososoo much!
Honestly an enjoyable experience
g
I just completed every achievement and finally feel worthy to leave a review. I loved this game, its was consistently challenging, required some crazy puzzle solving at the hero's graves and the rises. And ultimately told one of the most cursed yet beautiful stories I've ever seen.
addicted
pretty fun world to explore and get lost in
mhm :nodders:
A single studio managed to create a genre in gaming. I am a big fan of from software i can say this game does not disappoint. Hours of content thats engaging through and through. A massive success when released and with the upcoming dlc this game will shine with popularity.
Some gift me elden ring please pookies ^^
it's definitely a video game
It good

Good Game hyped for DLC
i cant fucking sleep
I mean like, it's not bad.
behold, good game
its aight i guess


Banger
THIS SHIT IS GASSSS

reused assets, bad mechanics, gorgeous world and vague lore. Feels bad, but looks good. Just more FromSoft.
game great instead of horrible
"Time to kill baleful shadow" "Yes Ranni"
una poronga
Almost as good as ds2
awesome
10/10 would recommend having patrick stumpjob asmr in the background while playing for best experience
If you considering dying ever 5 mins, this is the game for you
I am John Elden Ring and I approve this message
however you are maidenless
literally the best game I've ever played. I cannot recommend this game enough.
the ring is very old. not enough water
amazing
Rock Solid

This game is difficult and offers many varieties of difficulty. But it's worth playing through to the end. I say you should do whatever it takes. Use the wiki. No shame.
Pretty good, Melania gave me blue balls ngl.


fuck hoarah loux, fuck radagon, fuck malenia




10/10 game
Kill me so hard.
Slept on this for 2 years thinking it wasn't for me. Decided to jump back in before the expansion and now I am blown away. 
The sense of discovery, the overwhelming size of the game, the vast variety of possible character builds, the adventure, the challenge. It's all crafted beautifully. It's hard in a way that doesn't feel cheap. If you die, it's usually your fault, and everything can be overcome with enough perseverance. 

Quite literally one of the best games I have ever played.
iz goooood.
yuh
Greatness ahead and then Praise Dog!
Masterpiece
It's one of the greatest games ever made.
steep learning curve for non-soul OGs but one hell of a game.  Visuals, soundtrack, lore, its all there, even combat most of the time, control-wise speaking
favorite game ever
I would absolutely recommend this game. I have now played this game on both PS5 and Steam, for a collective of 490 hours. I have been a FromSoftware fan since Bloodborne, and while that game might be my favorite thematically and storywise, I have to say Elden Ring is by far, the best FromSoftware game on the market. The quality of life improvements in this game have set a new standard for FromSoft games, as well as games in general. You get every cent you pay for with this game. I have friends who count this as their first FromSoft game, and on one hand I think that's lucky. On the other hand I know that backtracking to DS3, Bloodborne, or DS1, will be even more difficult for them now. I cannot wait for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC to release, and I look forward to dumping another 100+ hours into this game.
should've added a ranni sex scene
Well, it's no Bloodborne thats for sure!
5 hours in and only died twice not bad
dayum
Game is trash. I died hundreds of times. Cried. Gave up. Died couple hundred more times. Bit my controller in half. Really hit a stride doing solid damage and bodying guys left and right. Finally made it to the first boss. Died a couple thousand more times. Repeat process for the next several bosses. Eventually some dumb dog guy in a rob starts lobbing rocks and koolaid at me. Reminds me I have never played a soulsborne game before and this is the reason why (because I am bad and these games cheat). Die a couple thousand more times to absolute horses**t and beat the game. Did it like 9 more times after that. I hate what this game did to me. 11/10
It took me 150 hours to get the Dung Eater Puppet, and it was worth it.
Great
The Dark Souls 2 Killer
amazing game. all around amazing.
this game is too hard to play
fun
very good game , just started, but loving it....  con,   would like to see more key settings for all the commands
good game 10/10

Elden Ring is a masterpiece that transcends mere gaming. It‚Äôs an odyssey, a symphony of darkness and light, woven into the very fabric of a shattered world. FromSoftware, Miyazaki in collaboration with George R. R. Martin, has birthed a universe that defies convention, beckoning players to explore its secrets and confront their own mortality.

World-Building and Atmosphere:
The lands of Elden Ring are hauntingly beautiful. From the sun-kissed grasslands to the desolate ruins, each locale tells a story. The crumbling castles, twisted forests, and ethereal skies evoke a sense of melancholic wonder. You‚Äôll lose yourself in the grandeur of it all.

Combat and Challenge:
Combat is a ballet of steel and magic. Every swing of your sword carries weight, every dodge a desperate dance. The challenge is unyielding, but fair. Victory feels earned, and defeat is a lesson in resilience. Elden Ring doesn‚Äôt hold your hand; it grips your heart.

Lore and Mystery:
George R. R. Martin‚Äôs touch is evident in the lore. Cryptic runes, forgotten gods, and fractured histories await discovery. The game tantalizes with glimpses of a cosmic tapestry, leaving breadcrumbs for the curious to follow.

Mounts and Exploration:
Riding your steed across the plains, scaling cliffs, and leaping chasms‚Äîit‚Äôs exhilarating. Your mount isn‚Äôt just a means of travel; it‚Äôs a companion. The world opens up when you‚Äôre on horseback, and secrets reveal themselves.

Boss Fights:
The bosses are titans‚Äîmajestic and terrifying. Whether facing a fire-breathing dragon or a spectral knight, each encounter is a symphony of desperation. Learn their patterns, adapt, and triumph.

Art and Sound Design:
Elden Ring‚Äôs artistry is spellbinding. The play of light on armor, the wind rustling through ancient banners‚Äîit‚Äôs poetry. And the haunting melodies, the distant echoes‚Äîthey linger long after you‚Äôve put down the controller.

In Elden Ring, death isn‚Äôt a setback; it‚Äôs a brushstroke on your canvas. So, unsheathe your blade, kindle your spirit, and venture forth. The Elden Ring awaits, and with it, a saga that will echo through eternity.

Remember, brave adventurer, you are not alone. Countless others traverse this fractured realm, seeking purpose, redemption, and the elusive Elden Ring. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
Mjau
i still have no maidens
yay
My favorite game. Good performance.  10/10.
One of the best FromSoftware games you could ever play. Worth every penny and I am ready for some DLC!!!!!
This is peAk.
Game good, therefore pickle
Its hard but good.
beautiful
first souls game and the vibe is absoulutly goated can be tricky to navigate but other than that 10/10 game.
I meannnnn
The worst key mapping I've ever seen. For me, it's not even playable since right mouse button moving forward is hardwired into my reflexes and you cant map the mouse to move forward. Worst key mapping Ive seen in a long time.
so so sos so sos so so sigma
yes very fun!!!!
10/10 would not recommend!

Jokes aside, besides the cruel, unforgiving nature of the world, there is a beautiful game with top notch level design, amazing combat, great class system and fair bosses.

PS: Except Malenia :D
I made Postal dude in this game 10/10
Don't give up skel-I mean Tarnished!
I love being stepped on by red haired goth chick
rip the pot guy
Good

This is a great game, it's my first Fromsoftware game. It plays exactly how I expected a Fromsoftware game to feel. Enjoy it
I can't stop playing, help me please I want to stop I just can't stop

Why is it always dog?
best game ever
a game its worth and peak yurr
if the dlc does not have any barefoot characters, i'm refunding
Still no ultrawide support........................LOLLL.................................. game is better on a controller too.............................. 8=D ~ ~ ~ ~
i have yet to git gud
If you thought the Darksouls series was hard then imagine that x5 and out pops Elden Ring! This game will have you banging your head against your keyboard in no time, Yet like an ex girlfriend you always find your way back to it. Nothing better then thinking your safe jumping a gap to avoid an enemy then BAM! Right as your sipping that fine HP juice you get sliced and diced and served on rice. 10/10 for those wanting a real challenge.
amazing when you have someone slightly experienced to show you the way, otherwise its kinda above average because you need a tutorial for everything or miraculously find a 50 hour full playthrough of somebody using the exact same build as you (which won't be hard if you using a common bleed build which is basically cheating until you realize that Godfrey doesn't take bleed damage). I will probably get bored of it after twenty five full playthroughs and start playing sea of thieves again. Easily 5+ stars overall.
Fuck this game

20 hour update: Fuck this game

35 hour update: Fuck this game
gud game
GOAT.
God game
good
(G)reat game (it) was (gud)
The best souls like game. I have always had a problem with dark souls series mainly regarding it's visuals. I like the setting however shaders and gamma has always been awful. But in Elden ring FromSoftware fixed this issue, shaders became more vivid and gamma became more colorfull + it is simply one of the best art style games of all times I have ever seen. 
 The only problem is an open world feature at the second part of the game it is empty, especially the last location. So if the game was just not that big it would be 10 out of 10, but unfortunately it is 7.5/10.
yes really good game
get gud game
ye
It make me big mad, but then when I win, big glad
Muito bom!
Good game there is a dog
One of, if not THE, best game I've ever played.

This game is amazing. First souls game as well. Been playing cod only and this game has shown me what a true game for 70 bucks should play like.

can someone gift me this game pleaseee. Iv been wanting to play it for soo long.

I'll hit 200hrs and still not fully understand the story.
Game's so difficult I couldn't make it past the loading screen
when the ring becomes elden.idk i didnt play
my arm is broken and it hurts to play and yet i continue
It's perfect
This game is like being in a toxic relationship with somebody. They do the absolute worst to you, that you can imagine. This game has stolen my money, called my dad a racist, spit in my face and stole my car. 

With all that said my love for open world roleplaying games far outweighs my frustration tolerance, so I always keep coming back to this god forsaken game.
best game ever

An Absolutely stunning game, great fights, great story, great map, literally nothing wrong. 10/10
The caves are nice!!!
Best game of all time. Hands down. After 300 hours across 2 consoles. Took me 132 hours to beat the game and I still have trophies left to nab. Very fun game. Well worth the $60
all deaths no maidens
Have you ever want to feel like you‚Äôre being kicked in the balls, toothpick between your toenails and kicking the wall? This game is for you. 

Im definitely not a masochist.
Very nice
Laggy, even on good config, but damn fine game right there. Try your own build and don't look up builds online, discover the game yourself
Love this game to death. I have 100% it on Xbox and will do it again on Steam.
VERY awesome sauce.
it good

Absolute Cinema
it's alright I guess
i got good. one of the most satisfying games to exist imo, really rewards the effort you put into it while learning the game.
Visually pleasant. Well crafted world and story. Big replayabilty with "reforged" and "seamless coop" mods.

10/10 in everything.

"only one more try i promise"
Elden Ring continues the trend of every FromSoft game I've played, where there's a genuinely great game there, but it's near unplayable due to a few baffling decisions from the developers. The combat is well balanced and very fun, the world and graphics are also great. The difficulty even felt quite fair, if even a bit too easy at times.
But the game is marred with a bunch of bad decisions holdovers from previous titles. You cannot play this game without having a guide open on your phone. Missed the church at the beginning? No crafting kit. Missed some sites of grace? No levelling up for the first 6 hours. Don't know about non linear stat progression? Your build is fucked. I don't mind a little reliance on wikis and guides, but your game should at least be playable without them.
Also, this sorry excuse for a co-op system is downright shameful for a modern game. The seamless co-op mod fixes it, but I shouldn't have to risk being banned to play a more functional version of the game.
Overall, very disappointing since there's a lot to love about the game that's held back by FromSoft fans claiming they can do no wrong. I'm sorry, but I don't think FromSoft quests have ever been good.
Definitivamente no he salido del videojuego
fun game
This game gets better with every playthrough its ridiculous how much content there is. Also the soundtrack and lore are straight masterpieces!
m
no
W game
Delicia pa sacar el veneno.
very good game cant wait for dlc to get released
I have never been so calm about my streak of deaths before.
Played this on my laptop and I plan to play it on the Steam Deck when the DLC comes out later this month. Would highly recommend this game to anyone who is into Soul type games, this was definitely From Software's best souls game so far.

Graphics: The game looks beautiful, I know there was some people trying to compare it to other releases but in all honesty, with the scope of the game you can definitely appreciate how wonderful this game looks.

Story: It's a Souls game, be prepared to be confused, read a lot of item descriptions and finally watch a video from VaatiVidya and a few others to figure it out.

Gameplay: This is where the Souls games excel, you're gonna get frustrated, you're gonna die a lot, but if you stop and watch your opponent, you'll see their patterns and begin to learn how to take them down properly, There are always glitches but most of the time, the enemy is limited by the same factors you are. You'll find MANY playstyles and it's almost impossible to not find one to fit you. Don't be afraid to experiment.

Sound: This game nails the sound and music. Nothing much else to say there.

Overall: Must buy game in the souls list, if you get one, this is the one to get.
S tier game


I hate this game
This game makes me hate myself 10/10

Truly remarkable game!
I love this game I'm in the 9.5% of players who have 100% of the achievements !!!!!
0/10 no big lady >:(
ARISE NOW, YE TARNISHED
It's challenging, it's rewarding. This game has secrets on top of secrets. If you like finding out the story by piecing together clues, this is for you. If you like facing a wall and overcoming it, this is for you. If you don't care for learning enemy attacks and figuring out how to exploit their patterns, it probably isn't for you
Fucking generational
Buy it, play it, and annihilate
tuff game
good game
MARGOT YOU STUPID FUCK, ROT IN HELL
It's so big my bum can't take it.
Best souls game after Sekiro
Cool game
It is a masterpiece. I don't know what else to say.
the game is amazing

great game if you love dying
Best Game Ever!

One of the best games I have ever played. I am actually sad that I finished it already.
fun game
This is by far the best game made in the recent years by far! 
Bros HELP me out, my friend said if I get 777 likes and 777 awards, she‚Äôll buy me a new PC with a RTX 4070ti Super and $770
on Steam! For those of you that help me - THANK YOU
it gud
so good.. omg..,,

ebin
The best open world game ever made.  Yep, I sincerely believe that. Takes the mechanics of Dark Souls and perfects them in a rather fluid, player driven experience in the open world. Almost no hand-rails guiding your progress - making it about discovery and player choice. Heck, you can missed gigantic portions of the game and still get to the ending, if you wish, but by exploring the world fully, you get deeply rewarded with more content and bosses.
Just perfect
Best game of all time
i looooooove it
Peak
Very good game, must buy!
If you want your ass kicked, buy this game! :D
every cutscene is wallpaper material
The best game of all time.

Probably my new favourite single player game.

OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING
Fun

Great Open World
Challenging and cool Combat
Incredible Music
Fascinating Lore

The only thing I really dislike about Elden Ring is the classic basically non-existent story-telling in Fromsoft games.
The game is hard, but persistence is key. I keep getting better the more I play and am really enjoying this game.
goes well with ivibrate
why is it always death
You don't have the right O you don't have the right
This is the peak, so far at least. Elden Ring is the boogyman that haunts other developers into postponing their release date, because it's just too good to compete with. It took every other title that Miyazaki ( the game developer guy, not the studio Ghibli guy ) dropped, and refined it into this absolute banger of a game. My hype and love for this game was as high as it was for Dark Souls III, I would've ranked it higher than Dark Souls III if Miyazaki had done 1 of 2 things. Added mimics to the game and perhaps made more objects into mimics. Looked past his love for debuff swamps and stopped adding it to the games. Thematically I liked Dark Souls III more, but this story is so much more powerful, and I'm in love with his fragmented storytelling that you have to figure out by exploring the remains.
i have 6 hours on steam and 500 on ps i would defently buy this game
Absolutely beautiful game! I know I have only played for mere hours on steam but I played on console before and its STUNNING... seriously.. LIKE BEAUTIFUL GAME. WOULD GIVE 100 STARS
dont buy this game
What can I say... This game is a masterpiece. From Software never disappoints and this game shows its. OK! I'm done being a fan boy for a bit. Yeah this game has all the things from perfect combat and level design to fulfilling game play loops. 9.9 / 10.

My only gripe is the open world is a bit too big.. 10% ish toooooooo open but otherwise perfection.
GOOD BOK
best game ever made brev
ban godskin duo
After many playthroughs and new games, multiple modded runs (Convergence), and a bunch of randomized runs, it's safe to say that an end is not yet in sight.
Great game! Getting back into it before the DLC drops
good, but beware of dog.

I completely forgot I was alone with a drink in my hand and my wife getting railed by this games stunning graphics, perfect difficulty and many hours of exploring perfecting my build. This game beats my dead marriage!!
this is an amazing game is you really want to hate your life!

It's Great
Praise the dog
Dung eater wanted to get freaky and i happily obliged
Yes
this game is great, but it feels so overwhelming to start a new playthrough just because of the sheer amount of things to do
not a bad thing, the open world in this game actually feels more alive than most other open worlds in gaming. it's just a bit too much for me
though i'd still rate it a 7/10 just because I love the innovation this brings to the genre, with the weapon arts from ds3 being overhauled and more mechanics to make playing more interesting (e.g. shield counters and jump attacks) which makes me excited for future instalments, including the dlc

This is the game of the decade. It is to the 2020s what Skyrim was to the 2010s.

I usually play all games on easy and only turn up the difficulty when I get bored, so it took some adjustments to get to grips with the soulsborne style. This game is hard, but that's mostly in your head. If you can fight the mental exhaustion and despair that comes with dying over and over again, you will actually learn a lesson for life here. I've recently taken up Muay Thai kickboxing at the age of 40 and it actually taught me much the same lesson: When you start something hard, you suck. Don't give up. You need to fight yourself and dominate your inner bitch before you can fight others. Kind of unfortunate that I had to get this old to really figure that out, but here we are. So yeah, Elden Ring is much like sparring with people half your age: You learn by repeatedly getting kicked in the head. Don't give up and you'll see that you'll adjust and get better.

In any case, this game isn't as hard as it seems (and certainly not as hard as previous From Software games) simply because it is an open world game. Once you figure out that you're not actually stuck on that boss (looking at you, Margit) but can just as well go somewhere else and bully low-level wolves for a few hours to level up, you realise that you can compensate for old people reflexes and shitty video game skills by putting in some time in the gym (or the Weeping Peninsula) to just over-level that pesky boss massively. You will progress through the game much slower than your favourite Twitch streamer, but you will succeed eventually.

Other than this the only thing left to say is: damn what an amazing feat of worldbuilding! This is at the same time the most oblique and crazy but also oddly believable game universe I think I have ever seen. It almost rivals actual real life history in how convoluted and dumb everything is. I love it! And there are some genuinely beautiful vistas to discover as well.

TL;DR: If you genuinely want to challenge yourself in video games, if only once a decade, Elden Ring is the game to do it with. It has as much things to learn, secrets to discover and challenging enemies as three or four games by other developers. It is worth every penny twice over.
I mean its elden ring. if you dont know what its about at this point idk what to tell you
Bears and lobsters are more fearsome than literal demigods.
I NEEEEEEEEEED a fj from Sellen üò≠üôè

Amazing
My first Souls game, and now I've cranked up every other game to the hardest settings. 
Even when I replay an old game, I set it to the highest difficulty. 
It made me brave and addicted to losing and rising up again (just to die again by falling off a cliff).
This will be my favourite game of all time. The sheer scale of this game is daunting. The world is gorgeous, the combat is fun and crisp and has so many different options, and the amount of things to do is insane. The feeling of coming out of the door and looking at Limgrave for the first time, or finding entirely new areas after 100+ hours of gameplay is something that I'll never forget. To me, this is the epitome of FS games.
I hate crucible knight
great game I love how open the world is especially compared to the dark souls series
Amazing game !!!
G.O.A.T
i fart it
fun and challenging
YES
kinda hard
Muy weno
Def my fav game
game good
good
PEAK
Swords
nice
Open World souls game absolutely packed with places to discover and bosses to kill. There's quite a few repeats, but a game that's this good nearly all the way through is extremely rare these days.
Dope
Get this game the bosses are really easy, such as Malenia, Radagon, the Elden Beast, and Malekith. Would recommend for new PC users!
malenia ez, deserved goty
yurrr
best game of that year
10/10 game, can't wait to get all achievements again!!!!!
MAIDEN BUT FINGER
this is one of the best game i play üëçüëç
I like it
Game Hard, Me Harder, Game Good
if you like dopamine, play. :)
its upper central mid
The game is phenomenal, it has amazing bosses and wonderful areas. It is also a very good entry point into the souls genre, as the inclusion of summons can be very useful to new players. I have been really enjoying and it is already one of my favorite games ever.
Amazing!
get it
Crumbling Farum Azula blows and this game hates you. 10/10
Best game ever
Why are you reading a review for one of the best games of all time? If you like soulsborne games, you'll love this one. 

It is a bit more forgiving than the classic Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, but I think in a good way. The open world design needs different approaches for gameplay. There's always something new to discover, quests to stumble upon or mess up, and many NPC lives to judge. 

The lore is as deep and inscrutable as ever, and it's a fascinating and beautiful setting for your character(s) to die in.
Epic
It's Formsoft. Anyone who's played a Souls game will know that it's quality game. This is basically better and bigger Dark Souls. Game is beautiful and is fun to play. Couldn't recommend more, and looking forward to the expansion.
Garbage Camera Locking and Field of View. You're not fighting the boss, you're fighting the camera.  - Disable the online features and play offline modding the shit out of it just so you won't get dizziness.
Fighting demons
ez
listen to that friend that told you to play the game. peak frfr
I skipped multiple days of school to play this.
NIHIL NIHIL NIHIL
gud
peak
Yeah its dope as hell, get it.
I originally started exploring this game due to the expansive lore. Now, I'm enjoying the increased frustration and rare I feel whilst gaming. 10/10
Good Game
Pretty flipping hard man :/

But still a great game 10/10
Fun
awesome game !
wanna made me wanna rip my hair out, but very fun
elden ring reminds me of if dark souls managed to get drunk with lord of the rings and then got skyrim to crash with them. afterward is a game where you ride a cute brown magical pony, seek guidance under a pretty lady, get fucked a hundred times over, and see even more pretty women who either want to kill you or become your consort, meanwhile being in beautiful scenery that's like eye-candy.

I have a love-hate relationship with the game, but that's just the type of stuff I choose to play and enjoy.
This most likely the best game/experience I've ever played/had
Once in a lifetime game honestly
Makes me wanna jump off a bridge, I LOVE IT!!!
This is the biggest game ever made. It's not about contents or playtime, but the scale, level design and amount of interests for exploration in the open-world is simply on another level
if u cant beat malenia ur buns at the game
it's good i guess
this is not for casual gamers
Elden rizz
*Flaming Horse*
Probably my favorite game I've ever played, even though it's my first Soul's game. Highly recommend to anyone.
gjood
The moon lady has bare feet, buy it
Elden Rolls
I'm barely even through the intro tutorial. Played a few hours a couple months back and just knew I was going to enjoy this game and story.
Rebuild the ring, marry four armed woman, burn the world, try fingers, but hole.
Best game.
Gas game, if u want a challenge or just a good time buy it. tbh I just want my review on the page before the dlc comes out
In a true magnum opus, Fromsoft have incorporated and amplified nearly everything that has made their past "soulsborne" games great: endlessly interesting combat, fascinating characters and lore, a vast and varied world packed with stunning visuals, and legendary boss fights with masterful voice acting.
This became my new favorite game of all time! Just incredible!
nah bad game for those who don't have gamersense
love to hate this terribly amazing game <3
AMazing
Typical From Software Dub
So fun, finally beat it and ran great on Steamdeck.
Yes
This game caused and cured my erectile dysfunction...
The first game I've played from FromSoftware, I've never hated and loved a game so much before. But on reflection after finishing everything in the game, it really is a top tier adventure and challenging game with tons of dungeons, hidden rooms, puzzles, bosses, weapons and builds to try out. Would definitely recommend.

7.5/10
Amazing game. Won game of the Year but in the running for best of all time. The exploration and boss fights are amazing
cute dogs
Yes. Also, DLC, so more yes.
gud
hamburger
You died
school sux

mid unfortunately
Alright so im not the best at these games and i absolutely hated elden ring because i sucked but a few years down the road after it launched it was just sitting in my library and was just marinating waiting for me to make my return. i was going through alot ending a 2 year relationship with my ex who i still miss and my best friend just went to the navy and so i was like why not and let me tell you this was the best thing ive ever experienced. Elden ring is basically a treat if you love the genre and sorts it will want you begging for more and the best part is that the dlc is coming out soon. if youre debating whether to play the game or not it doesnt matter if you suck or not because i did and i got better and now im able to solo most bosses when i used to constantly die to them in one hit. just remember to level vigor poggies. well what are you waiting for get the game already bro this masterpiece is something that cant be missed!
funny, cool music, ugly people though, except crucible knight, he sexy
Good
help, can't help playing
Incredible game! Fromsoft Never misses. 100+ Hours of Gameplay couldn't be any happier with the level of high quality content.
The Boss fights are some of the best and most fun I've ever experienced.
Is good
Beat Morgot at level 113, game was pretty easy from then on.
GREATEST game of all time
i have 80 hours on console and 75 on pc and i think i can say this is quite possibly the best souls like they have made yet
cool dude
Very lit game godrick got a level 10 skibidi gyatt
playing this game makes me want to curb stomp small children
Best game i have ever played. The lore will drag you into it and keep you engaged for hundreds of hours.
fun
Beautiful, epic, difficult, re-playable, versatile, scary, weird, gross, best game ever.
Never have I ever played a "souls-like" game.  This game was gifted and I didn't play any other game until I beat this one. Absolutely addicting.
Joguei pra porra, e ainda nem matei o gigante de fogo... pqp nunca mais exploro nesse jogo
I have been off and on and off and on with this game since its release. My first playthrough (which I hadn't finished), I rushed the main bosses all the way upto the fire giant, which I then got stuck. Now on my current playthrough, I am having a lot more fun and a smoother feel in progression. Doing each individual optional boss/dungeon and now I am on my way to Leyndell, Royal Capital. Only one slight issue however. I don't recall how I got past the DRACONIC TREE SENTINEL IN THE FIRST PLACE. This is the most issue I've had with a boss since my first playthrough, dying 300 times to Godrick the Grafted. I feel like I should be levelled enough to be able to compete against a generic enemy (especially since I have rinsed Radahn and majority other bosses prior to this sentinel) but I cannot figure it out. It is a very love/hate relationship I have with this game. I love it for the progression - the feeling and satisfaction of becoming stronger to the point where every enemy feels beneath me. I love it for the gorgeous landscape in every zone in the game. I love it for the interesting and unique boss mechanics each possess. But this one, disgusting, generic enemy is my hell. I expect to continue playing this game and hopefully beat it some day, but for now at least - I am no Elden Lord. I will continue my journey, slaying every single beast that crosses my path so that some day, I might feel strong enough to fell a generic knight on a horse.

Edit: Ignore all parts where I was having trouble with the Draconic Tree Sentinel. I am again on the road to Elden Lord (tee hee)
Peak.
ELDEN RING CAMBIO LA PERCEPCION DE MI VIDA ES TODO LO QUE SIEMPRE ESPERE DE UN JUEGO
Beautiful game but it's brutal and it's going to humble you real quick
At Level 146 swinging around the Guts greatsword imbued with the blood flame incantation and coated in ice grease with a mimic to kill Malenia, Blade of Miquella, I can confirm its a rather enjoyable experience.
hyhy
I'll probably never beat it.

Still loved it.
L√§ttaste jag gjort
Yes
Good
10/10 lol. If you're hesitant, watch a gameplay video before you buy. Miyazaki or whatever his name is makes video games better than anyone else, just buy it, youll enjoy it. If you dont buy it, ur mums gay.
this good i like it 


very fun game and not that difficult overall

.

Bring me the Elden Ring
great game
The game speaks for itself.
he he ha
DROL NEDLE
Is good.
Too ez, make it harder next time!
It is very fun.
Fun game with a plethora of weapons and enemies to try them on.
Difficult game so its not for everybody but the boss fights are immensely enjoyable.

Got 200+ hours clocked in at the time of review on console version and i wanted to try out the PC version, and so far so good with minimal stuttering.
Just dodge?
im so glad miyazaki got his car stuck in that snow
best AAA game ive played all around

Perfection.
game gud

best game ever
its great
:)
i died
Very easy
dude its elden ring get it

It's the only game i went out of my way to 100%, so yes you can say i recommend this product.
Big sword go smack
A very long lasting torture session for 50 bucks.
best game
Great game
This game beat the shit out of me and will keep doing so. But god damn do I want to get up and try again. 
10/10 banger soundtrack
Oh, you think you're good at Dark Souls? Have you ever even tried a NG+99, soul level 1, no armor, no weapons, no magic, no damage taken, no NPC's spoken to, inverted controls on an electric drum kit, no rolling, no back step, no sprinting, no lock on, no consumables, no audio, no parry, lowest possible resolution, lowest possible brightness, all boss and enemies killed, while drunk, hanging from the ceiling the entire time, all bonfires lit, walking everywhere backwards, sub-30 minutes speedrun? Yeah, I thought not. Go back to your LoL matches you brainless bump on a log.
i mean it's alright
 best game ive ever played. you can replay it so many times and never get bored, and theres mods. 

Its Elden Ring Baby, LETS GO!!!
i came
good
Perfect game with immersive lore
One of the best games I've ever played.

Do you like challenging games? Yes? Do you dislike open worlds from Ubisoft? But do you like open worlds in general? Yes? Then you'll probably like one of the best open-world games of all time. And certainly one of the best games of the last 10 years. Highly recommended for every Fromsoft fan and every lover of great games that don't want to take you by the hand. You almost get nostalgic when you think of RPGs and games from the late 90s and 2000s, even the early 2010s, and rediscover Elden Ring's / Fromsoftware's passion in them.
Died, got gud, stopped dying. 10/10 would die again.

Top 10 games of all time. Absolute masterpiece....
As a first time souls-like player, I hated this game at first. I thought it was the games' fault and that it was just too difficult. Then, I realized it was a Skill Issue¬Æ. Now, with Get Good‚Ñ¢, anyone can be good at Elden Ring! Just grab the largest sword you can find and put every point you have into strength! Now you too can Get Good‚Ñ¢!
Ok.
You died
Yes
good
masterpiece
deff one of the ez souls games but 1000000% worth it good first sould like game amazing characthers graphics nothing bad about it tbh worth the money mods are also really cool if you get bored of the replayabillity of the game which its fun to play more than one time after beating the game once which i find boring but this game isnt like that
good
This might be one of the greatest games ever. I dont regret a penny.
If i had to be real and say something that i find kinda meh about the game is that almost every side character doesnt have as much effect on the story as i would like them to.
Everything else this game is 10/10 anyway
Greatest game to ever touch this earth
yea
Enfrentate a un viejo racista de Pe√±aflor y a un grafista viciado al oro espa√±ol en este alucinante y flipante mundo de anillos de elden
by far the best game ive played in a decade. it actually worth its price and does not insult my intellgence. only gripe is the quest lines are really vague. beside that love the game
perfect game
Best game
ragadon such fucking bullshit
pretty good
peak
Very fun game, seamless coop makes the game so much more fun
Perfect
The closest game to perfection
I don't get it...

People say, "It's a tough game."but, 
feels more like bad mechanics "disguised" 
as a tough game.
Great game! Played this right after DS1. Cannot recommend enough!
Yes...
peak
geiles teil
If you're fighting an enemy and you need to roll to avoid an attack, wait 2 seconds and THEN roll. Thank me later.
In my opinion far worse than any of the Dark Souls Games (Yes even the second) only Fromsoftware game I liked less is Sekiro
The pinnacle of the Soulsborne franchise.
gud game
if you are insane you'll have a ton of fun as this game is the definition of insanity
Much more approachable compared to traditional Dark Souls. The open world is fun to explore.
too good

if you ever play it, my recommendation is to expect nothing, and let it surprise you.
that is in my experience, the best way to enjoy anything.

the only thing I would have hoped for was a way to save Blaidd at the end, like you can save solaire in DS.


GIt gud
I finally beat the guy with the horse from the beginning
PLEASE, add the option to unlock FPS and play offline. It's so easy for the devs to do it, just disable online when you choose to unlock FPS.
peak
It's a good game.
Yes
Extremely fun, but it is very easy to get lost in the massive map. Overall very fun game and very enjoyable to play. Also has an amazing story so far!
Masterpiece.
vara gud
old ring simulator
very fun and entertaining but if you get mad easily you might need breaks in between fights
no horse ahead
gud game
It is good
Great game. no more to say.
I mean ... duh?
;
Malania ):
I'll just start by saying this game is one of the best games I've ever played, in a sea of positive reviews I'm sure no one expects to see otherwise anyway, but I want to be part of that sea anyway, because I love it that much.

Souls style games were always something I wanted to get into, I love the aesthetic so much, it looked so appealing. But... I use to let other people scare me out of trying these more difficult games because I was worried I wouldn't be good enough and waste my money. With the DLC coming out I decided to give it another go from the beginning with a friend, and boy I'm glad I did... I had some of the most fun in video games than I had in a long time! Sure I played multiplayer, used summons when soloing so maybe I still suck compared to most players... but it was a BLAST! Even with the constant player invasions! It was frustrating and annoying at times (especially with some of that latency issues... I swear I hit him!!) But it was so fun and funny at times.. like hiding as items with my friends watching invaders desperately search for us... kicking them on ladders they were chasing us on. So many laughs were had. 

If you are scared of not being good enough.. take it from a shitty player who managed to 100% the game with friends and summons (I even solo'd Malenia ;w; How?!) It's so worth it, just remember to just have fun with it and it's not worth being scared, mad, or anything~ Play however is most fun for you cause it's just a video game! The gameplay is amazing and the story and characters are great! The frustration is worth the rewarding feeling of success at the end! I hope you have as great as a time as I did!
Maidenless
whats the point of reviewing elden ring? just play it.
add quarterstaff
its great!
make mohg the goat necessary for progression and itrs perfect video game
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (oh)
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now, when you see me, I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me had chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show, you can tell that I'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say, it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now, it's me who they want, so you can go
And take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah, yeah)
If "Happy Ever After" did exist (oh, yeah)
I would still be holding you like this
All these fairy tales are full of shit
Yeah, one more fucking love song, I'll be sick (yeah)
Now, I'm at a payphone
Greatest game of all time
o elden ring

hard but rewarding
great game i only died a few hundred times but i never felt more alive than when a spear was being shoved through my heart after a missed dodge roll

what year is it? i haven't seen the sun in many years , great game , one of the best , amazing story , amazing graphics , great gameplay loop , boss fights, customization and much much more , 1000/ out of 10
I died non-stop. Can't recommend this enough.
Don't talk to me until you have beaten John Elden Ring
I want to end my life
I hate this game. 10/10
Elden ring was an experiance to say the least.

For me Elden ring is the first open world game that justified its open world
20 hours in and i'm barely scratching the surface. What a monumental game
While the game is good, it is a downgrade in many aspects from the original Dark Souls.

- One of the main issues is enemy attacks clipping through walls, years later from the original Dark Souls and they still didn't fix that; 
- Attacks from bosses have weird, sometimes delayed or not natural movement created specifically to throw off the timing of dodging, on the original Dark Souls the bosses are hard but fair, they didn't break how movement animation works, or made it messy to the point you can't identify what you are seeing, for the sake of making it harder for the old players who are already familiar with the dodging mechanic; 
- They have to design the movement from bosses based on the limit of the camera mechanics, they pushed bosses movement to the point the shitty camera dating back from Demon Souls can't make anything visually clear;
- The world is vast but in a negative manner, it makes replayability much worse, you have to go out of your way to get weapons, items, upgrades and so on. The areas and enemies are less distinct from what you have on Dark Souls;
- Yes, every weapon is viable to a certain degree, but the balance still sucks, and makes gameplay much less diverse;
- The game uses TAA that creates visual blur and there is no other option, you can turn off AA, but the game turns it on everytime the game is restarted, the HDR option is buggy and it only works properly sometimes.

The point is, instead of correcting what was wrong with the previous games and building on what was good, they kept many of the issues, they made the game harder on artificial ways, that is bad game design.
ye
Just a lean brain console port.
The lack of customisation of the controls not understandable and ruins the entire game experience.
this game makes me sad, spawn, die, level up, temporary happiness, die again, level up.
endless cycle of pain and suffering.
This is the penultimate of all souls-likes. Don't let anyone tell you differently. Nothing touches the experience or atmosphere or magnitude of this game. Buy it without question. Pull from your savings to buy it. Rob a bank to buy it. Do whatever it takes and play until there isn't a single place you haven't seen or an enemy you haven't felled.
its good but u definetly wanna sewerslide after playing
phenomenal
:]
Fun and beautiful but hard as fuuuuuuk.
ring of eld
Is fun, Yes.
good game big game
Truly a action rpg masterpiece. You're beautiful!
Malenia peak boss

i need a fj from sellen
I bought this game and it looked really good!

I kill*d a person on a horse,
I walked in the villages half naked,
stole a sword,
kill*ed people with the sword,
I drank a potion that tasted terrible,
And then I came home and played Elden Ring
try fingers
but hole
fun
No ultra-wide screen support in 2024. I know its a good game but I seriously am thinking of getting my money back because of this.  I bought  base game along with the DLC and I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately felt like I was back in 2008.

Bethesda just added ultra wide support for Fallout 4 which is a much less successful game.  I guess FromSoft just don't care that the game looks like it is from 2008 on wide screen monitors.

Thumbs f'ing down
Game good, me not as good
This game is good.
bis
i fight, i die, i pick up runes, get skronger, i beat game many times. not bad for a first soulsgame completion for anyone.
high standards maker
Very good, boss very hard
So I met this girl on tinder, Her bio was "Malenia, Blade of Miquella" or something, Kinda cute tho ngl
Elden Ring deserves to be a magnificent masterpiece from director Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team, combining the best essence of the Souls game series with a vast, majestic open world and an easily accessible innovative gameplay
Could this be, dog?
Fought Margit for 5 hours with a katana and a dream, strategy never changed and kept coming back for more.
Elden ring changed my life.

normally i dont write reviews but i chose to make an exception for elden ring.
this game is insane. and i love it. I'm 125 hours in and i keep discovering new stuff.
Also the first time you beat this game is a feeling like no other.
I truly can't recommend this game enough and i can't wait for the dlc.
(sadly i can't buy it) 
anyways just play elden ring if you haven't already.
i used to be maidenless and i might still be but at least i can say i beat elden ring.
Proudest achievement in my life :)

According to my calculations i have been AFK in the title screen for 30-35 hours

10/10 Would do it again
Giant Lobster equipped with MW2 Intervention. I would dropped that mf in a rust 1v1.
Its Alright
GOAT
Great
i js died died died died died n .... ran outta flask
I love killing people with 200kgs of pure steel
Hard open world
A luxurious voyage filled with breathtaking views, impeccable service, and unforgettable experiences at every port of call.




First souls game, made me want to die, loved every second of it. Boss music makes me feel ways
142 hours in and I still don't know what or who tf an Elden Ring is. But does it matter? I say nay. This game is beautiful and metal af.
It real good
Great game. Looking forward for Shadow of Erdtree.
GOOD

amazing
cant say anything bad about the game at all. i played this on release on my xbox one x and had the best time ive ever had in any game ive ever played, i have put off buying it on PC for the past two years until some new content came out.

Today i did just that and i spent the past 2 hours on youtube trying to fix the poor FPS issue and stuttering. unsure why it ran so poorly on my 5600x, 64gb ram partnered with 3090ti.. but fps was dropping to 15-20 fps constantly and just stuttering. 

tried every fix online but nothing helped it run smoothly at 50-60fps. in the end i refunded which is a shame as i was super eager to play it again. 


Very cozy game
Game good, must buy.

Regarding this, Felis buy the damn game, need friend to game with.
Another amazing game. Thank you Miyazaki and From Software...

Who wouldn't want the chance to be killed off every time you see even a rodent.
It calms my nerves to play this game, i feel relaxed and happy. Not prone to smash my keyboard at all.

seriously though this game changed my life.
It's a FromSoft game. 

Unlike most modern AAA companies you know, this one delivers their content exceedingly well and worth the thick $$$ price tag.
First off, Elden Ring
Seek rump
Could this be a rump?
Likely rump
Therefore praise the rump!

I never wanted to break my controller so bad.
goated with the sauce except the enemies have the cool combos instead of you

shit
Behold, the ELDER RANG.
Elden john
yes
Games so good I have 3 playthroughs and all achievements on xbox. Built my pc and bought it on steam to do a fresh playthrough for the dlc.
MASTER PIECE!!
It's a game that grew on me. At first I didn't like it, felt it was too open. Time passed and I started to actually get involved in exploring and trying different builds.

Would recommend, plan to still play for 200+ hours
mmmfgh
love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, hate it, love it, love it, love it even more, super hate it, im gonna kill myself, love it again, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, hate it, love it, love it, love it even more, super hate it, im gonna kill myself, love it again, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, hate it, love it, love it, love it even more, super hate it, im gonna kill myself, love it again, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, love it, hate it, hate it, love it, love it, love it even more, super hate it, im gonna kill myself, love it again, the best game ever

5/5
this game is somethin else man
Do yourself a favor. Become Elden Lord
tuff game
I LOVE THIS GAME!
good game.
if you like bashing your head into a brick wall this is for you because eventually you will learn the hardness of each brick and find the softest brick to bash against again and again and again till it falls in the most effective least self damaging way and if you arent good thats fine thats no skill issue just come back later learn from other games because truely skill issues dont exist its just a future quest to back track on at a later date. Cant understand its complex lore thats fine to I mean we have youtubers that do that for us anyways its not meant to be fully understood and found by just one man all the important stuff is just kinda easy to find and learn. Im just saying all of this because im pro-new player unlike all the narc type players that will hate on any negative yet valid review I mean these people forget these reviews are "do recommend" and "do not recommend" and say skill issue as their only counter argument detering more players from trying it out.
She Malenia on my Blade til I Miquella
Newd more Hug mode
fuck ass game
Plot
mommy melina
Its good but me make very angry :(
Fun game, if you like this kind of thing !
ELDEN RING
I might be a masochist.
Masterpiece.
Hands down one of the best games I have ever played! What more is there to say that hasn't been said before!

I highly recommend you play this now!!
Amazing thought into scenery and gamplay!
might be my favorite game of all time at this point
üëé
Its alright

fye
ELDAN RONG IS FANTASTIC BROS & GALS
very nice
This game is boring.  It's clear a ton of money, energy and effort went into it, but the best word I can come up with to describe this game: contrived.  There's no soul in this soulslike.
Repeatedly fail and overcome challenges.
good.
Best game this decade.
is good game
PLAY IT
The best game
this game has taught me that pure spite and the indomitable human spirit mix very well to beat a boss 10/10
Its tits
Rahdan goes Brrr
game is boring and ass

like dark souls without the dark or the souls
gud
its awesome sauce
One of my favorite games of all time. If you like Fromsoft games combined with an open world setting and great lore then look no further.
Best souls like game I have ever played.
asdasdasda
its a FromSoftware game
This shit hard.
it's a good game
fun game :3
This game is like eating a bag of trail mix blindfolded. You blindly reach into the bag and you immediately bight down on a cacophony of flavors and textures that you have no idea what to do with, but as you become more familiar with each peanut and pretzel, it just becomes that more enjoyable. The sourness of the raisins and its difficulty to chew through may put you off and cause you to pause and take a break for a moment, but that satisfaction of finding a rogue M&M always brings you back till you finish the entire bag thriving for more. But the bag is never truly empty. You go back and find the left over hidden bits and flavors that make it even more addicting to dig through, filling your mind with more questions and causing you to dig deeper into the bag. I love trail mix so much and I am so excited for the Chex Mix DLC.
Good!
I hated myself for playing this for four months straight when it first came out on my old xbox. I can now hate myself again for the next 10 months with the dlc coming out too
What can you say.. It needs no introduction, everyone and their dog has played it by now...
Great game all round. It sucks you in and time flies by. 

10/10 from me..

Roll on Shadow of the Erdtree DLC !
best game i've ever played
Very fun game 10 outa 10. Helps with depression and anger issues.
this game hard
Good Game, BUT ADD PLAYSTATION BUTTON PROMPTS ON PC PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
This game be fun :P

Yeah, I guess it's alright.

A damn masterpiece, holy shit...

It's perfect in everyway and so nostalgic, and they sure don't hesitate of making it difficult for ya.
This was my first entry in the souls series, I went into it with the mindset of a seasoned monster hunter player and it meshed pretty well, I was able to read and dodge through a lot of encounters based on that experience alone, tried out lots of playstyles in the early game, settled on a fun mix of intelligence and strength with the moonlight sword and proceeded to play into NG+4 to get all the achievements on the same save file

It's a wonderfully immersive game that can even be somewhat relaxing after getting a feel for the combat, my girlfriend briefly played Co-op with me but unless you are running with the "seamless co-op" mod then it's really cumbersome if you're trying to experience the whole game together from start to finish

With the DLC approaching I recently restarted a save file so that I can play through the regular difficulty

Don't let the community talking about the game's difficulty scare you away from trying it either, it's not nearly as hard as they say it is save for a select few encounters (*cough* melania *cough*) so you should have a great time if you are a fan of classical high fantasy
This game is peak!

dog
Very gud
Fantastic game. Lots of fair points of contention but the only thing objectively wrong is the lack of replay value due to the reuse of bosses and dungeon content across the game, killing any interest in re-exploration. Still objectively one of the best triple A games to come out in the past few years. It might not be for everyone but you have to respect what it does.
multiplayer is awful
This game changed my life
Dual wielding Golden halberds in tree sentinel armor is how you win the video game

i played 118 hours in 3 weeks and i finnaly beat the game i recomend this if you want to go into seclusion and addiction if you want to beat the game
I love and hate elden ring, and honestly I‚Äôve never felt so strongly positive about a game while also despising it so much lol. 

The Good: 

-The lore and main story is some of the best fromsoftware has ever made, at least in terms of complexity and detail. 
-The side quests/characters. Most of them are really fleshed out and have a lot of depth to them, and are just simply fun overall. Ranni‚Äôs questline in particular, which is the main one, is straight up some of the best stuff fromsoftware has ever made. 
-The art/presentation is untouched by almost any game. To the cool medieval aesthetic or the weird alien touch that some areas have, or the incredibly epic bosses, it‚Äôs just amazing and nothing else. The way that the world is designed so that the erdtree is almost always visible is really well done and just adds an extra layer to the worldbuilding and level design. 
-Most of the bosses are fun to fight, even the copy pasted ones (mostly because they‚Äôre usually easy tho lol). 
-soundtrack is goated


The bad: 
-Copy pasted enemies, bosses, and assets that make exploration feel repetitive and boring, coming down to a basic open world formula that is just boring (imo. Okay, alot of this is my opinion).
-The balancing. There‚Äôs some serious whiplash where you‚Äôll be fighting super weak enemies and then all of a sudden a strong one comes in and just insta kills you, or a boss is just stupidly hard and makes you feel underleveled even when you‚Äôre not, or has an attack that just seems way too strong. Maybe I'm bad though idk. I wasn't using any summons so that certainly doesn't help me at all lol. People like to say ‚Äúif an enemy is too strong just don‚Äôt fight/come back later to kill it‚Äù, but honestly that just doesn‚Äôt feel like good level design to me. In dark souls the enemy placements/strength made sense, but in this game it just seems all over the place. 
-Level design (not talking about the open world here) as a whole is just really weak here, although it shows signs of their expertise now and then. The more closed off and dark souls-like areas are still really open, and feel really lackluster with usually just a ton of weak enemies thrown all over the place for no reason other than to fill space. In dark souls every nook and cranny is designed usually to make the not very careful player suffer horrible deaths, but those moments are few and far between in Elden Ring meaning that most players can rush through with little to no care and not suffer any consequences. Certain sections of the game are really good, but most areas are just not that complicated in their design, and pale in comparison to their previous games. 
-The themes in Elden Ring are shallow compared to dark souls. Dark souls, at least as I understand it, is all about how horrible humanity and the world can be, and how a person can rise through it all and persevere to accomplish great things. (Keep in mind I could be missing a lot as I've never watched any lore videos of either game). Elden Ring doesn‚Äôt really have the same oppressive atmosphere, and instead of persevering you can just summon an npc or other players to help you (You could do this in dark souls but they expanded it here), rather than figuring it out yourself. That goes against one of the main things that make fromsoftware games so unique and incredible. Instead Elden ring‚Äôs themes are more like ‚ÄúOhh damn that‚Äôs cool,‚Äù rather than anything thought provoking and full of thematic depth. (The characters/overall lore is full of depth but in this case I just mean the themes). 
-I feel like a lot of the music, while amazing, sounds a little same-y, and also doesn‚Äôt have the same depth as dark souls 1, where there would be emotions of a boss hidden within. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs much of a thing here, even if the soundtracks are consistently bangers.

Deep thoughts:
Elden Ring is a fantastic game. But in the process of streamlining it and putting it into an open world, a lot of what I loved so much about Dark souls is gone. This is hard to explain, but I want to compare Elden Ring to Skyrim because they are both open world games. Skyrim is all about exploration as well, and is masterfully created so that the player is getting a constant feeding of fun stuff to do and see and discover. Playing Skyrim, my emotions are very consistent like a straight line, constantly stuck at around 75%, for example. I grew up playing that game and it‚Äôs the thing that made it so successful in my opinion, or at least one of the reasons. But then there‚Äôs dark souls. It‚Äôs the complete opposite. It‚Äôs brutal and doesn‚Äôt hold your hand at all, and you have no choice but to get that stuff done or you can‚Äôt beat the game, and you don't have an easy way out for the most part aside from guides and summons, which aren't as op as in Elden Ring. All of this is why I fell in love with that game as a kid. My emotions would be a constant zigzag of rage and frustration, to sadness or fear, and then all of a sudden such an incredible joy that I had never felt before, like it was electric. From -50% to 150%. It‚Äôs a unique experience that you can‚Äôt get from any other game to that degree, and there‚Äôs a saying that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing quite like your first souls game.‚Äù It‚Äôs very true. After that, even coming back to the game as an adult to actually finish it, that zigzag was a lot less sharp. The lows weren‚Äôt as low but the highs weren‚Äôt anywhere near where they had once been. I play fromsoftware games constantly chasing that incredible zigzag. The only thing in real life I‚Äôve ever experienced where I can get that zig zag of lows and highs is in my writing. Writing is hard, just like dark souls. You have to work to get what you want, and there isn‚Äôt any way to cut corners. But the highs? Some of the best moments of my entire life have been from writing. For a game to emulate something so close to that is nothing short of incredible.

But Elden Ring goes against it and follows games like Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, any Ubisoft game probably, and other modern open world games, where they make sure you never have too hard of a time and get rid of a lot of the depth that make rpgs, rpgs.(at least compared to dark souls or classic rpgs). However, as a result, the highs are just not the same. Elden Ring is boring. It‚Äôs such a shallow straight line most of the time that it feels like a complete waste of my hours, at least when I‚Äôm exploring. Yes, there are rewards for doing it, but I see the basic open world exploration formula they used and it‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶ meh compared to almost everything else.

Regardless of everything I hate about Elden Ring, I can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs a fantastic game, just like Skyrim is (I'm not a particular fan of Skyrim's design concepts though in case you couldn't tell). Elden Ring is an 8/10 for me, mostly bogged down by the open world aspect that just clashes too heavily with the souls game formula, and the copy pasted content. I see why it was such a huge success, and why so many people praise it to death the way that I do with dark souls. I just hope that fromsoftware doesn‚Äôt continue with this streamlining approach that almost every AAA developer has nowadays. 

Now, do I recommend the game? Of course. Do you like massive, complex open world games with amazing, often cryptic stories throughout, and challenging bosses? This game gets a lot of praise for a reason, and is certainly a must play for any open world game fan. If that sounds like your kind of game, then go for it my friend, and good luck.
best game I've ever played it's so addictive
YOU SEE THE ELDEN RING, AND THEN YOU DIE. AND RESPAWN. AND DIE AGAIN. AND LOSE ALL YOUR SOULS...I mean...RUNES. This is a true open world non linear game. 90% of it is optional. You can go anywhere, but you'll get your ass kicked everywhere. Compared to Dark Souls, you can expect some quality of life improvements and some minor attempts to keep up with modern genre standards. You get a horse, a map, fast travel, and you can jump now, but that's about it. The game is hard. The late game mandatory areas and bosses can be a real pain. Level grinding may be required, but can still be fun. And there's co op. There's no shame in letting someone take out Malenia for you, she's the worst. I think the invasion based PVP system still sucks, but some people are into it I guess? You will struggle, but there are just so many different armor pieces, weapons, spells, and items to create any build you want. And you can respec at the Mage Academy as long as you have a larval tear. I recommend a faith + arcane + dragon incantation + bleed + crimson rot build. I also enjoy a good intelligence + dexterity + katana + sorcery + frost build. Ranni is my queen! The fun and challenge is in finding the right build for you, then watching the mimic tear do all the work. There are hundreds of missable side quests, caves, crypts, optional bosses, several endings, and new game plus, so ridiculous replay value. A dark fantasy masterpiece, despite some of the same weird FromSoftware quirks, wonky physics, and cryptic nonsense that have been around since Demon's Souls on PS3. You should play this game, but you have been warned. Death awaits.
One must imagine Sisyphus happy and a strength enjoyer.
endless builds, endless fun..!
one of the greatest games of all time

This is From Softwares Magnum Opus. Exploration, combat, build versatility, weapon variety, boss design  are on a new high. You cannot go wrong with this one.

Stunning Graphics, Challenging Game play, And a Story that captivates!
Just barely finished my first playthrough.
Amazing game. Good replayability.
this game is so skibidi
good


It's the only game that I ever got all achievements... Also, it`s the only game that I ever got all the achievements twice! That should be enough for you to know that YES, this game is incredible. 10/10, the best game I have ever played.
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.

good game gg
It took me a few tries/years to actually get invested in Elden Ring and I'm glad I eventually gave it an honest shot. It's very cryptic and I honestly feel like a guide/manual/reference is required to make any progress. Once you have a grip on what to do, the world opens up, and you really start to understand the scope of how large it is. It's really hard to describe just how big the map is. Also, there are so many things to do; I definitely did not 100% this thing. I really wish there was a quest log or location markers to keep track of the game but I understand this game's ambiguity. If you like an open world and a high skill ceiling, I would recommend this.
You know its amazing...
Lots of fun
very challenging but fun  all the builds u can make and  the graphics our amazing the pvp is ok
wouldst thou truly purchase sanction

Fantastic game play and exploration. Combat is incredible. Lore is great but lacks an actual story line (this is by design)
Goated game, one of the best games ive ever played and my favorite from the souls series
Yeah, it's good
Yippie
This was my first souls game and was pretty good üëç
Compited 100% on PS4, don't regret bying it for PC. 35 hours in, 50% complete, soon will be 100% again. Defenetly the best game by FromSoftware
DLC will bring content it needs for old players
Epic game.

You will suffer, you will get tilted, but in the end it's so worth it.

This game is lit
great
just play it and give it time
yes, but the engine is kinda shitty hard locked to 60fps, and especially under linux with amd a lot of crashes that take the whole pc with it. Might not bei their fault, but a shitty driver, but anyway other games do not have that issue.
Best Souls game I've played so far. Every person will have a different experience based on their skill level and preferences. The universe is amazing and well-written, and the side-quest stories are compelling.

My only complaint is the total lack of a quest log to remember where you were in each of the side-quests. This makes it unbearable to discover by myself, and I had to take clues from my friends or search the internet. It seems there is a mod to track all the steps you took with each quest to serve as a history of progress. This would be enough and would enhance the experience with side-quests a lot.

Despite this, it is totally one of the best experiences I have had with a game in my life.

I love From games for their lore and world-building, but by goood I am bad at them. However, I found Elden Ring very flexible and accessible gameplay-wise, as the game has a huge variety of builds and all sorts of things that can help not-very-skilled gamer lol. The world is beautiful, the story is engaging (if you're willing to dig into it), every single moment invokes a sense of wonder.

Oh, and there's also wonderful Seamless CO-OP Mod that lets you play with your friends (it keeps the game offline + creates its' own separate save files), which quadrupled the fun for me.

Highest recommendation.
GOTY every year.

Pretty good game
[h2]Gateway to the Souls-like Realm: Elden Ring[/h2]

As someone who embarked on the journey of Elden Ring without prior experience in FromSoftware's realm, I must say, it was a captivating plunge into a world unlike any other. Elden Ring not only opened my eyes to the allure of Souls-like games but also left an indelible mark on my gaming soul.

What struck me most about Elden Ring was its unparalleled freedom. From the moment I set foot in the Lands Between, I was free to chart my own course, to tackle challenges in my own way. This freedom was liberating, empowering me to forge my own path through a rich and sprawling landscape teeming with secrets and dangers.

But it wasn't just the gameplay that enthralled me; it was the intricate tapestry of lore woven into every corner of the world. Elden Ring doesn't spoon-feed its story; instead, it beckons you to explore, to delve into forgotten ruins, to decipher cryptic item descriptions, and to converse with the enigmatic denizens of the land. In doing so, it rewards curiosity and engagement, inviting players to become not just spectators, but active participants in its unfolding narrative.

Of course, I would be remiss not to mention the game's formidable difficulty. Elden Ring is not for the faint of heart, presenting challenges that will test your patience, your skill, and your resolve. Yet, with each victory, no matter how hard-won, comes an unparalleled sense of accomplishment, a feeling that you have truly earned your place in this unforgiving world.

In the end, Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's an experience‚Äîa journey of discovery, exploration, and triumph. It's a testament to the power of immersive storytelling and the joy of overcoming adversity. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the Soulsborne genre or a newcomer like myself, Elden Ring is an adventure not to be missed.
Well Elden ring was my first souls game, and imma be honest, it was the game that really made  feel something, the last time that I had those feelings was only playing BO2 and GTA5. I had it already beat it on PS4 and was the first game that I preorder in my whole life of gaming, I can‚Äôt not describe the amount oh joy I had discovering this new world and the bosses that I encountered. Later on in the same year that Elden ring launched I had decided to build my first PC, and fast forward this year I decided to beat one more time this masterpiece here on PC, I‚Äôm really proud that this game was my first platinum on steam. My fellow tarnished, I can‚Äôt stress u enough‚Ä¶ Play this game ! This is a most.
And one last thing‚Ä¶Bloodbourne  for PC when Sony !?
FromSoftware's magnum opus
Most definitely the greatest game ever created. Basically, FromSoftware, the creators of the game, took the best parts of all of their previously created souls games and combined it here in a unique way. There is something in Elden ring for everyone to enjoy.
I'm still on my first playthrough and so far I really like this game. Its perfectly crafted and a good storyline. The only thing I feel needs changing is how hard it is to kill minibosses. I mean they are mini for a reason. If your reading this and new or about to get the game I really recommend leveling up vigor, dex and strength. Overall I am absolutely loving this game. (comment if I missed something)
OAAAHAH ELDEN RING AHIAHH
Ye
Game of the year 100% Amazing game!
just trying to get the steam badge thing
perfection

top notch
Masterpiece!
Put these foolish ambitions to rest.
Foul Tarnished, in search of the Elden Ring. Emboldened by the Flame of Ambition. Someone must extinguish thy flame.
It is hard, but it is fun to learn how to do it
This game is amazing. Difficulty is perfect. Only thing is bullshit sometimes with some hits. Melania waterfowl is bs 24/7 and was not fun to fight. Mimic tear op asf so didn't use it for my first play through. Ranni is hot asf. Anyways, I 100% this game and it was great!
50% great souls game 50% open world padding slop
very epic
masterpiece
Its great. Gibs wouldnt know
soulsbrone series go brrrrrrrrr
Muito bom
I like the guy stuck in a pot.
 Great game
I hate EAC it's probably the worst anticheat out there....
Bricked my game for years, bricked my armored core on release, bricked starship troopers and numerous other titles...
I've tried reinstalling games to no avail, deleting all EAC files and reinstalling to no avail, I've tried reinstalling windows to no avail....
I pulled the most smoothbrain idea out of my a** and it worked, drag and drop "start protected game" from VRCHAT to elden ring and now it's working.....
VRCHAT was the only dev who put in the effort to fix EAC being a worthless mess so if you're having issues with EAC and can't play online because of it then here's you're fix probably won't find it online anywhere.
it's gud
my hands down favourite game next to skyrim
masterpiece. This is the game that got me into souls-likes and games like Lies of P. Would highly recommend this game.
Definition of a perfect game.
Let it happen
ABSOLUTE DOG SHIT GAME(LOVE THIS FUCKING SHIT, WILL PLAY IT AGAIN)
i mean its just such a great game and is quite literally game of the year just buy it all ready. i cant rate it higher

game of the year still 2 years later.  10/10
This game taught me once and for all that I dislike souls like games more than Mobas. I got yeeted so hard it took me almost 2 years to find the mental strength to leave this review.

I never really got past the damn bandit camps in the very beginning. I then tried using a certain tool we all know, to make myself stronger so I could at the very least beat ONE enemy. The game then warned me that I would lose access to online functions if I don't disable said tool.

So I just kinda gave up because there is no way for me to play this game. Skill issue :c
This is the peak soul-like game.

Won GOTY for a reason
you don't have the right, oh you don't have the right
NOT MY FINAL REVIEW: Fantastic game so far. Like adding Assassins Creed: Odyssey's open-world RPG to Dark Souls/Sekiro world building while also mixing in a healthy dose of fantasy here and there. So far I'm loving it and will give a full review when I feel ready.
it's fun
great game
Every single girl you could simp for in this game has commited some or several war crimes and/or genocides. Superb.

amazing game
I got a hug from Fia so 10/10
nuh uh
idk why I never reviewed this one. The game is good.
easiest game i ever played, got every achievement in less than an hour
I play this game as someone who doesn't often play video games. The world is interesting and gorgeous and the enemies are creepy af. There is a learning curve for sure, but it is worth it in the end,
Can be played as hard or easy as the player wants. 
Nice entry point to ease into Souls-like games given the difficulty is variable

Highly recommend this game to people who want a challenge. Definitely deserves the game of the year award.

Hark! Gather round, noble lords and fair maidens, for a tale of grand adventure and treacherous lands awaits. "Elden Ring," a marvel of our age, crafted by the hands of the wise and visionary FromSoftware, dost transport us to a realm of shadows and glory, where the brave may find fortune or fall to despair.

In this vast and wondrous world, known as the Lands Between, a tapestry of rich lore and perilous quests doth unfurl. Here, the Elden Ring, an artifact of great power, lies shattered, and with it, the very balance of the realm. The player, a tarnished soul bereft of grace, is summoned to restore order and claim the title of Elden Lord.

The lands are fraught with danger, and every step is a dance with death. Fierce beasts and eldritch horrors lurk in the shadows, ever eager to rend flesh from bone. Yet, for those with the heart of a lion and the skill of a master swordsman, there is much to gain. Hidden treasures, ancient magics, and allies of various temperaments await those who dare to seek them out.

The combat is a symphony of steel and strategy, demanding both swiftness and cunning. One must learn the ways of the blade, the bow, and the spell, for each foe requires a unique approach. The mightiest of adversaries, the fearsome bosses, are titanic in both stature and challenge, each a true test of the player's mettle.

Aye, the Lands Between are not without their beauty. From the misty peaks of the Altus Plateau to the murky depths of the Lake of Rot, the world is rendered with breathtaking artistry. The architecture is grand, the vistas vast, and the details intricate, weaving a tapestry that captivates the eye and stirs the soul.

Yet, be warned, for "Elden Ring" is not for the faint of heart. The path is fraught with trials, and only those of steadfast resolve shall prevail. But for those who endure, who rise from each defeat with renewed vigor, the rewards are beyond measure.

In sooth, "Elden Ring" is a masterpiece, a testament to the artistry and vision of its creators. It is a journey that challenges and enchants, a saga that shall be told for ages to come. So don thy armor, sharpen thy blade, and venture forth into the unknown, for the Lands Between await their savior.
fun
elden ring
Some say its a bad game because they are bad.
the game is easy :)
will take over ur life but its gud
what can ranni hands do tho
guud
best game
It's nearly perfect, it's unbelievable.
Fromsoft has done it again! It's not often that a sequel comes along and adopts an open world and can manage it to make it this engaging. Often when sequels become larger and promise an expansive open world, the level design, map, and content tend to go by the wayside, with the game offering more quantity over quality. 

What Fromsoft has done with Elden Ring is a masterclass game design. They have essentially taken the formula from their top games, and woven them into a seamless open world that contains the intricacies of the dungeons of their previous entries.

They have officially set the bar of how combat, world building , itemisation and open-world games should be designed.  Elden Ring is a Masterpiece!



One of the best games of all time.

Possibly one of the best games ever created.
Worth every penny beautiful atmosphere cool weapons so many different builds you can do pretty cool bosses its just all around a great game i would recommend giving it a try

Just buy the game and try it.
Die, Get mad, Die Again, Sigh, Gets Better, And Wins Boss Fight. Why do I put so much effort in a game but none in my own life?

Baum dimais da conta
Pretty fun game, It is hard though
If you walk into this game and allow yourself to run into combat against the big knight and die in the first ten minutes, I believe you're robbing yourself of the true beauty of the experience.
Elden Ring is a really ambitious project by a team who's biggest strength is avoiding any and all ludonarrative dissonance. Pay attention to the lore options and really make up a person who lived and died hearing that one day they might come back to the Land Between, or that their parents told them they might come here. Play a grounded perspective that avoids pain and death, and explore the world. 

See how far that takes you. Pay attention to the weirdness in interactions, watch for the flecks of blood and the distinctions, similarities, and causalities. Don't lose a sense of wonder. Don't lose a sense of humanity. Don't die so much that death becomes normal and life becomes a thing you ride past fast on a horse. 

Collect flowers. Pick berries. Study alchemical truth.

Played on ps5 around 180 hours to platinum and just recently started my pc playthrough to prep for the dlc. Im around 50 hours in and stand before the boss that will be the entry for shadow of the erdtree. Probably the best game ever made for me personally. If i have to call out one game it would be elden ring. Phenomenal world, phenomenal lore, phenomenal gameplay. Few open worlds manage to actually be interesting but this one is definitely one of them and most certainly one of the best. "Oh damn whats over there?" Youre dead. Love it! I cannot recommend this game enough. And since youre able to level and tackle challenges at your own pace this is also very friendly to people that are new to the soulsbourne genre. Go get it tarnished. Youve been touched by grace! Thanks Myazaki you absolute genius.
i hate foreskin duo
its aight
This game is easily one of my most favorite games ever. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, they give you little to no hand holding which serves a lot of challenge and everything from boss fights to discovering different graces this game is easily the most superlative games on steam.
e
If you told me 3 years ago that I would love this game, I wouldn't have believed you. Never liked the idea of RPGs and the thought of large worlds with a grind-factor. Maybe it's the familiarity from seeing some gameplay and thoughts of others, but the exploration is fun, doesn't feel like a grind, and there's so much to find and explore that you don't realise minute to minute how far apart the milestones are. The exploration is fun as the world is filled with so much of interest regardless of if you have a full understanding of the story and how these things connect.
Look at my horse, my horse is AMAZING! Give it a lick!
Just a brilliant game
i love elden sbing, its so good, godfrey best boss ever. buy this masterpiece please. 
the game itself is very good but the camera controls and the horrible lock on makes the game terrible. i have died so many times because the game refuses to lock onto enemy and the camera is freecam instead of always on the back (which it should be) which means you frequently miss attacks
i like the parry moive,,, would be a 10/10 game if everything could be parried
best game ever love that shi
Try fingers but hole
Behold, Review!
best gaem ever !!!!
this game is the best game i playd but
exquisite.

O Dog O Dog
The best and most accessible a Souls game has ever been. The style of game isn't for everyone, but it provides ample opportunity to learn and get better as you lose over and over, and very little beats the feeling of accomplishment when you finally overcome that hurdle.
i hate and love this game
fuck fire giant.
I would refund this game for $2 if i could.  I put 15 hours back in 2022 and majority of that was trying to defeat one boss.  Yes I know I suck but this game was not good for my mental.  I get that majority of the community loves this game but this just wasn't it for me.  If you are the type that likes to slam their face into their keyboard while you fight a boss over and over and over again until you know their move set, then get it but had I known this was that type of game (my first souls like) I would have never got it. If i could time travel, I would go back to right after purchasing this game and punch myself in the face.
 nice game

Great story, great character customization, great stats' system (weapon scaling), great bosses, great pace. The only thing some people might find to be bad in this game is it's difficulty, even though it is just trial and error.

Overview
Elden Ring is the latest action role-playing game from FromSoftware, renowned for its challenging gameplay and intricate world-building. Collaborating with author George R.R. Martin, FromSoftware has crafted a vast and immersive open world that sets a new benchmark in the genre.

Story and Setting
The game is set in the mysterious Lands Between, a sprawling and beautifully designed fantasy realm. Players take on the role of the Tarnished, exiles seeking to restore the shattered Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord. The narrative is rich with lore, combining the enigmatic storytelling style of Hidetaka Miyazaki with the deep, mythic world-building of George R.R. Martin. The story unfolds through environmental storytelling, NPC interactions, and item descriptions, encouraging players to piece together the intricate plot.

Gameplay
Elden Ring builds on the signature Souls-like mechanics, with challenging combat, strategic thinking, and precise timing. The open-world design is a significant departure from previous FromSoftware titles, offering players unparalleled freedom to explore.

Combat: The game features refined combat mechanics, with a variety of weapons, spells, and abilities. Each encounter demands strategy and skill, rewarding players for mastering the deep combat system.
Exploration: The Lands Between are filled with hidden secrets, challenging dungeons, and formidable bosses. Exploration is highly rewarding, with numerous side quests, hidden items, and lore to discover.
Customization: Players can extensively customize their character's appearance, stats, and equipment. The game offers multiple classes and the ability to mix and match skills, allowing for diverse playstyles.
Graphics and Design
The visual design of Elden Ring is stunning, with diverse landscapes ranging from lush forests and haunting swamps to grand castles and dark caverns. The art direction creates an atmospheric and immersive experience. The attention to detail in the world design is exceptional, making exploration feel both exciting and rewarding.

Audio and Music
The soundtrack of Elden Ring is hauntingly beautiful, complementing the dark fantasy setting perfectly. The music enhances the atmosphere during exploration and heightens the intensity of combat encounters. Voice acting is also top-notch, bringing the characters and story to life.

Pros
Expansive Open World: The game world is vast, beautifully crafted, and filled with intriguing secrets.
Challenging Combat: Combat is rewarding and requires strategic thinking.
Rich Lore: The story and world-building are deep and engaging.
Customization: Extensive character customization options cater to various playstyles.
Visuals and Sound: Stunning graphics and an atmospheric soundtrack enhance the immersive experience.
Cons
Difficulty: The challenging gameplay may be daunting for newcomers to the genre.
Pacing: The open-world design can lead to pacing issues, with some players feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content.
Conclusion
Elden Ring is a masterful blend of FromSoftware's signature challenging gameplay with a rich, expansive open world. The collaboration with George R.R. Martin has resulted in a deeply immersive and lore-rich experience. While the difficulty may be intimidating for some, fans of the genre will find it to be a rewarding and unforgettable journey. Elden Ring sets a new standard for action RPGs and is a must-play for any fan of the genre.

Rating: 9.5/10
gaem gud, promise
The most accessible of From Software's titles imo, I enjoyed it more than the Souls Trilogy, but those games are great too. The build/weapon variety is amazing, and the Ashes of War customization for weapons is fun. It has an open world that doesn't suck and constantly put your brain in high information mode. Graphics/OST are good, game play is amazing, so what are you waiting for? Just buy it, you won't regret it.
TLDR: This game is great and i look forward to the DLC. I haven't beaten the game yet, but my god this game is simply amazing. I love the other games but after 48 hours and still so much to do and find and figure out and try, saying I'm impressed is putting it insanely lightly. This is a game that takes so much from other souls games and turns it to 200, then adds it own flair, including my favorite feature, the jump button.
Perfect game

very pain

very annoying game, i love it 10/10
I always liked the idea of soulsborne games. Being able to learn to adapt to different enemies, having a deep lore, taking your time with the game considering we spend so much on buying these. But for some reason I could never get into these type of games.

But Elden Ring, oh, Elden Ring is just amazing once you get the hang of the game. The best part of the game is the freedom it gives you to roam around the map and take fights according to your skill level and learn the mechanics of the enemies. I almost gave up on this game when I was stuck at an enemy but decided to give it a try again and just wow now a part of me doesn't want the game to get over. The bosses are fantastic to fight and it gives you such an amazing satisfaction once you beat them.

The visuals are TOP NOTCH, the world seems dead as well as lively at times and it just makes it more appealing to the eyes. sometimes i just sit at a site of grace looking at the view kinda like a screensaver mode. 

If you want to play soulsborne type games but you could never get into it I suggest this masterpiece.
played with my girlfriend 100/10
its just like dark souls
A piece of art
goaty
I watch a streamer called Mande I would recommend because if he can complete the game. He uses broken OP builds and still struggles to beat bosses! but he does it
its one of the best
This is just barely a recommend from me, to be honest. There's a lot of jank and a lot of bull shit, but its still a good time regardless. Came back to replay before DLC drops, and the game definitely has more problems than my rose-tinted glasses had me remembering. The combat design for far too many enemies just feels so poorly thought out. 

If there was to be something that would keep you from being this game, in my opinion anyway, it'd probably be the god awful camera and lock-on mechanic. You'll also be staring at the ankles of a lot of giant, and cool looking, enemies. Enjoy dodging what you cant see.

Lore wise and story wise, it's great. Too bad I had to go watch 40 hours of a dude breaking down the lore for me on youtube because it's easier that way than the way the game does it, but i will say there is a charm to the way the game does it....it's just not a style thats for me.

As whole, 6.5/10 from me.

Horrible game dont buy bosses are too unfair :[
It feels like a terrible amalgamation of several different ideas, all slammed together into the same slowly dying soulsborne template. Adding open world to it really doesn't change the gameplay. Bosses are worse than ever, the environments get dull fast. And the story is an even greater mess than ever before. The entire game feels very unrewarding.

But hey, you get a dedicated jump button now. Progress. After roughly 14 years of not having one.
Raani my beloved
Near perfect, a couple of compromises due to sheer amount of content but understandable.
good game
The only advices I could give are to not listen the hardcore community, to persevere and to enjoy the game the way you want. It is rich and has a unique experience to offer.
ŸêAHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The grind was painful but once was everything was on track, its the best experience so far in my life. the story isn't explicit but there is depth to it, as well as the arc of the NPCs.
One of the greatest games i have ever played. Not for the faint of heart and not easy for casual players since it is a pretty hard game but, if you can push through the hardships you'll face while playing then you will not regret it. Give it a shot, i highly recommend.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
Great game. Dark Soul fans will love it. Looking forward to the expansion. Open world, explore where every you want.

You launched on playstation, there's absolutely no reason to not have a toggle for different button prompts in settings. This isn't some magical feature, this is letting us use assets that were already created and in the game files.
yeah this one might be good
Slight challenge
wanted to impress the guy I like by not skipping the tree sentinal (I have never played a souls game before) it took me a little while but I finally did it.
probably the best game ever made, should be an example of the words open world game
awesome
This is the only open world game I really enjoy. Everything is a challenge and yes you can die A LOT no matter what level you are.
Maidenless
its a very nice game really except one thing is the fire giant most braindead boss ever but overall a very nice game
12/10 game easy for new players to souls bourne

game make me smash controller grrrr
Beware of good game ahead
Sadly, this game destroyed the Dark Souls legacy and turned it into delirium. Open world was a bad idea, and it simply destroyed all progression and challenge that was meant to be there. No balance at all - you could arrive at the place filled with monsters who can easily oneshot you and be frustrated like never before. Or you could accidentally become too strong for some other location and lose all interest and passion to explore. The feeling of being involved into fairly balanced and hard fight against some really well designed boss - for example, Artorias - was (and still) absolutely mindblowing. I love when Artorias hits me, because next time I will be better. I will clunch my teeth and hit him back next time. In Elden Ring bosses are too unpredictable, they spam you with so many attacks that learning quickly becomes pain in the arse (and that's on top of what I said about unbalanced level difficulty).

And what about the game's story? I don't care about any maiden or villain you show me, I can't understand what NPCs are talking about 80% of the time and I don't feel my own purpose in all of it. The world and its inhabitants are simply meaningless.

I really tried to give this game a chance, I really did. I have about 3000 hours in SoulsBorne series. But after this review, Elden Ring will be the first game that I am going to delete from my library forever. And I have played a bunch of games, believe me.

Elden Ring is beautiful - it has a ton of funny builds and weapons, gorgeous locations, varius enemies and it was made with passion. But at the same time, I feel no excitement from this adventure, no connections to other characters, no purpose in the world, the story sucks a big one. Just why, Miyazaki? Why? It is not just a betrayal, this one right here...


Elden Ring has just killed the whole generation of games for me. And the fact that people continue to hype around this video game is simply disturbing. I will replay Kings Field, Dark Souls, Demon Souls and Bloodborne, but that's it. The End.


[b]Rest in peace, my favourite video game series.[/b]
GREATNESS.
Fantastic game, gorgeous, epic, fair, difficult, stylish, great look and feel overall
i like the part with the elden ring
Hit bosses with my very strong balls 
10/10
[b]I THOUGHT THIS WAS A CAUSAL RPG?!?!?! WHAT ROLE AM I SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING?!?!? THE VICTIM?![/b]
10/10 would like to be used and abuse again
Yes.
Behold, dog!
help i haven't seen my family in days, anyway. if only i had a pickle
Really fun game when you learn how souls games work. It was my first souls experience and idk if i've ever gotten so angry in my life of gaming. I had it cracked first but I bought it after I beat it for the DLC!
It's ELDEN RING!! If you want to dedicate hours to exploration and the type of combat that will get your heart racing... then look no further... you have found the only game you will need for quite some time! Pick it up now so that you're ready for the DLC!

i like this game i think

Amazing game! Can‚Äôt wait for the dlc.

yeah this is probably the greatest game of all time
If you like the color yellow, this is the game for you. Every single yellow color palette you can think of is in this game. Oh... you want a game-play review? Right! I recommend that if this is your first Fromsoft game, like it was for me, get friends. Not only are friends just a great idea for enjoying life, but friends who have the experience help bring you into the "know" when it comes to things that will actually help you. This game was not built to help you. O no... poor maiden-less Tarnished. It was built to punish you until you find a way to overcome adversity and climb to the top of that great hill to taste the dust of victory. I know what I said. I recommend this game to my friends who have the wherewithal and tenacity to do that. I don't recommend it to my casual gaming friends who don't find mighty challenges to be entertaining.
Dogshit game
The amount of lore videos you will have watch to understand most of the story is probably the same as the amount of hours you'll have on the game. pretty neat game
Rump ahead!
Try finger, but hole!
HARD AF but once you get the moves down and upgrade the character, it gets easier

best game ever
GOTY! DLC SOON!!!
yes
YES
Its a great game, it has beautiful environments, a huge area to explore, a lot of enemy types and bosses, a ton of gameplay styles. If only it had a better quest system it would have been even better. Being forced to use an online guide to be able to do most quests is ridiculous for me. But besides that, its a lot of fun.
Great game. Ngl just play it.
try fingers, but hole!
Great game... buttt only if you can handle the amount of deaths u will encounter

Best game of all time.
Real Good :)

best game ever
One of the best game plays you can find with so many viable builds as to be absurd. 
You are kidding yourself if you think it has a story ( the massive videos are mostly guessing based on a few scraps of lore here and there).
The side quests are essentially impossible without a wiki open as they all require you to go to numerous super specific locations in order with almost no guidance for most of them on a massive open world map and most have arbitrary cut off points that can cancel them  if you do specific things.
Since most builds are based on items and were they are is completely random at first glance don't feel bad to look up on wikis where stuff is. For a game that is designed to be super frustrating if you don't have knowledge it can be beautiful once everything comes together.
aneurysm
This game is so good and perfectly challenging that after i finished it i gained hair in places i never had or didn't think i could grow hair and YES...even there.
Words cannot describe how amazing this game is, and everything I could say has probably already been said by others.  only have a couple of hours on pc Elden Ring (whitescreen crash), but I have hundreds of hours on console (ps4) and have beaten the game nearly 30 times.
game of all time my absolute favorite game ever

gud game
Elden Ring
dis that good shit right here
9/10 game would be 10/10 if ranni had four feet instead of just two
Master piece!
I spent 170 hrs on my first playthrough on PS5, so as far as the game itself, it's massive and easily a 10/10. I'm mainly writing this review to talk about performance. Like I said I played this on PS5 originally and the performance there was ok but not great. I would get a solid 60 fps in dungeons and castles, but in the open world it would frequently drop to the mid to low 50's, at times maybe even the high 40's depending on location and situation. I initially avoided the PC version because I had heard that it suffered from stutter issues, however those issues must have been patched out at some point because in my 24 hours with the game so far, it has run nearly flawlessly. It should be noted that occasionally I'll get one very large stutter a few moments after launching the game, but then everything returns to normal and I won't have a single other issue for my entire 5 hour + game session. On my system (4080/13700k) I get a solid 60 fps at all times with everything maxed out with raytraced shadows OFF. The raytracing in this game is pretty demanding and even just turning RT shadows to low can cause the frames to drop to the mid 50's during certain times of day when the sun casts long shadows for trees in some open world areas. Mostly I just play with RT shadows off to maintain that solid 60 fps at all times and that alone has made double dipping from PS5 to PC worth it, and just in time for the DLC later this month.
this game changed my perspective on life. I WAS REBORN INTO A BETTER MAN AFTER PLAYING 1 MIN OF ELDEN RING
It's nothing as revolutionary as its sold, but big Dark Souls with a horse is fun.
very good game maybe best game oat

best game to ever be

Only one word I can say thank you elden ring elden ring is my first soul game and I saw myself I really get addicted to it I love it

O mundo de Elden Ring √© visualmente impressionante, com paisagens que variam de florestas exuberantes e montanhas nevadas a ru√≠nas antigas e p√¢ntanos sombrios. Cada √°rea √© √∫nica e cheia de detalhes, criando uma atmosfera envolvente que mant√©m os jogadores imersos do come√ßo ao fim. Sem falar de seus bosses marcantes, literalmente uma aventura √©pica que testar√° suas habilidades e paci√™ncia.

best game of 2022
Came back to beat the game just to prove i can beat it faster than Kai Cenat. But fr it's a goated game with amazing combat and graphics. One last note......... screw mogh.
one of the best game i ever played...worth every dollar i spend
all the memory i made through the game is so amazing
if i have to pay the same amount of money just so i can experience that feeling like the first time i play this game 1 more time...i definitely will do that

A game in which all the bad comes from the gays.
This ring is very elden.
one piece
good
best game ever created I would add more but im tired rn.
The exploits never got patched out and can still be used in multiplayer. They have no intention after a year of fixing them. Game is old enough now where every low level pvp is a dupe twink.

O, elden ring
by far one of my favorite games, played over 200 hours on xbox also
Hell Yeah
Yes, but from the bottom of my heart Malenia can really go f*** herself. :)
fun very hard game
its not dark souls 3 but is a great game nonetheless
Play with a controller.  It feels better.  Great game, buy game.
The game runs smoothly and is really fun. The World design and enemy design is incredible. Combat is difficult but fair (mostly). You will play this game for too long and never find all its secrets or Nepheli Loux after Stormvail castle.
Nah, I'd Win.
good
very fun, renellla made me put a whole in my wall, not joking :)

Best game of all time (played since launch on PS5), but on mouse and keyboard it was incredibly unwieldy. The whole reason I bought it on steam was to try mouse keyboard, and it just wasn't working for me. Requested a refund, and steam came through withing a few hours of the request.
10/10

finished the game on playstation

since then have moved to pc and so had to start again

the joy and pain of going back to elden ring

every time i played dis game i dont stop edgin to dis game and malenia can get it
Just Skyrim but harder.
a worse version of dark souls 2, the open world kills the difficulty curve and makes the game more frustrating than fun. and 40 bucks for dlc? thats 100 bucks for the whole package if you preordered the game then had to buy the dlc separate, which is plain greedy from soft, i'm disappointed in you guys.
Good game, haven't seen the sun in ages
Git Gud
Fromsoft did it again
You really gotta experience this one for yourself. If you are even remotely interested in the genre, this should an easy purchase for you. Especially with some DLC coming around the corner.

11/10, easy recommendation.

The game is flawless a true masterpiece I‚Äôve got no complaints it‚Äôs definitely worth the 60‚Ç¨. I would buy it even if it was like 100‚Ç¨. I recommend this game to everyone it‚Äôs so fun. It also has its challenges too. The game is hard but so fun. BUY IT NOW
Once you get past the learning curve it is a great game.... 100+ hours later lol

U need to buy it blud
What is there left to say about Elden Ring that has not been said already? As such, I will keep this review as brief as possible, only pointing at the negatives I have with the game. Fret not, for these are few, and do not sully my overall enjoyment of this incredible game.

Open-Worlds are a double-edged sword. The freedom they bring allow for non-linear progression, and a level of adventure and discovery a linear game simply cannot dream to compare to. However, that sense of discovery simply does not exist on subsequent playthroughs. It is difficult to bring myself to play through an open-world game more than once as I already have gone through the entire game, and seen most or all of what there is to be seen. When I went down the well in Mistwood, and came upon a beautiful underground, I was floored. That sense of discovery was something I hadn't experienced in an open-world game in a while. But I doubt I will feel the same way on a second playthrough. It is tough to get excited for a story if you already know how it is going to end.

Difficult seems very unbalanced in some areas. The Haligtree had some of the most bizarre, and difficult enemy placements I've ever experienced in a FromSoftware game. What are typically bosses would outnumber you on 3v1 fights in small rooms. Not to mention some bosses are overwhelmingly fast, making it difficult to punish as slower builds. I am glad that FromSoft has balanced intelligence and dexterity builds to be more practical than previous games. I always felt that if you were not a strength build in Dark Souls, you are pretty much doomed to fail. However I feel that strength builds have been left in the dust this time around. There is a reason why the meta revolved around dexterous, blood loss builds for a while at launch.

And lastly, to fill in spaces in this enormous world, assets are frequently recycled. Catacombs all feel far too similar, and mini-bosses and bosses are reused to the point where they do not feel special. If I ever decide to return to play Elden Ring a second time on New Game+, I highly doubt I will revisit the catacombs at all.

In summary, Elden Ring is FromSoftware and Hidetaka Miyazaki's magnum opus. 

Do I prefer it over Dark Souls 1 and 3? No, I do not. 

But do I consider it the objective better game? I do.

Elden Ring implements, expands, and polishes all sorts of gameplay elements from all previous FromSoft titles. Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and even Sekiro have all lead to this game.

I give Elden Ring:
9.0 Soldjars out of 10

I look forward to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and whatever this incredible studio and director have in store for us next.
Elden Ring is a good culmination of FromSoft's previous works refocused into one experience. I've put too many hours into this game, and it all felt worthwhile. New players to the genre ought to have a good time, as there exists a handful of ways to overcome obstacles and defeat bosses. Exploring the massive world of The Lands Between and trying out a variety of weapon builds is a blast. Definitely a recommend!
i hate this game, buy it
i have come to realize if you do not like this game it is a skill issue.

GOAT.

Amazing world building, incredible game building leads to an immersive experience unrivaled in today's gaming world

was having a blast till i saw the elon musk build...

Bloodborne PC WE NEED IT HERE
No ultra-wide support. Artificial black bars are added and the game still renders what is behind them. From needs to get with the times and stop releasing these half cooked PC ports.

Enjoyment ahead

Goated game
Best Souls game I have ever played.
Do I really have to pay for the new Shadow of the Erdtree DLC after have bought the Deluxe version of the game back then in the release?. Love the game, but fuck it.
If you like the Dark Souls Franchise you'd like the base difficulty of this game, but if you don't have the patience
or tranquility level to not get irritated about dying constantly this game is not for you
Best Game Ever!!!!

This game is an absolute banger, I played 3 times to it with different friends and it's always a different experience that makes me so comfortable <3 The graphics are breathtaking, the outfits are amazing, I love that we can all have our style !
Fun fun fun!
No better feeling than wiping the shit eating grin off of morgott's face, very satisfying with every boss you defeat
Yea, pretty cool I guess.
i became elden lord and lorded all over the lands between
goated
havent played much but it seems fun
Practically perfect. Even people who wouldn't usually be into Souls games can enjoy Elden Ring at their own pace due to the open world.
First Souls-like game I played and absolutely loved it. Stunning world building and some seriously impressive lore. Gameplay might not be for everyone but there are plenty of playstyles that can be viable for even casual gamers.

I have played through 4 times now on PC and PS5 and the PS version is definitely more optimized. PC has some random stutter issues and a bug with HDR thats still not solved. I don't like the quest design as its never clear what to do to progress questlines. seemingly random triggers and no real quest log to track anything. This makes using a guide necessary if you want to do everything. I also don't like the story. While the lore is quite good, the story is a mess. I know that's typical From Software style but if someone is playing for the story, they will be sorely disappointed. Also the big reveal at the end is not explained even slightly. No one is going to read a dozen scrolls and talk to 10 different NPCs to get fragments of the story. If I have to watch 2 hour long Vaatividya videos to make any sense of it, then its not good design.

If you don't care about the story, then this might be the best game you've ever played. Highly recommended but with a few caveats mentioned above.
‚ÄúOh, Death‚Ä¶ Become my blade once more

has woman
its elden ring dude
Fantastic action RPG that will satisfy you with twitch-reaction combat, sandbox world exploration, endless amounts of treasure hunting, and dungeon raiding. One of the top Action RPGs of all time!
masterpiece
best open world i have played and its a nice challenge
the bets game in the world 100% deserved game of the year idc
Soulful
Incredible game, terrible optimization. Run without eac offline if you average 40-50 and youll probably hit a solid 60 at max settings, however this means no messages or online play :(
Completed the game. Biggest piece of shit game i've ever played. And yes I beat Melania as well. 

Story is boring/none existent, bosses are too big a part of the game. Might as well make a full game where you play 150 bosses, and complete it when all are dead. It's so so cringe. Never wasted so much time on such an unenjoyable game in my life.
Masterpiece!!

This is what happens when a game studio and it‚Äôs directors didn‚Äôt compromise their vision for anyone or anything. This what a complete and finished game free from greed looks like when it doesn‚Äôt waste game development and potential thinking of ways of continued revenue through  live service, micros, and season passes. 

Elden Ring joins a rare table of perfect modern games
This stupid pop up keeps asking me to post something so here it is. Now go away. 

Great game. Thumbs down because they made me review through annoyance
the easiest game(not) on the planet. the bosses doesn't one shot you(NOT). mobs are very easy to kill(not).
recommend it 100% must buy game for sure.
I mean it's ALRIGHT
Literally the best gave I have ever played.
I was never into Souls games, but this changes everything. It has to be one of the best games I have ever played. 

Buy it, trust me you won't regret it.

Dark Souls 1 - 3, now Elden Ring... What more can I say 10/10!!!
amazing
Pinnacle of all that is golden
I've been trying to defeat Radagon and Elden Beast for the last 8 days, totaling approximately 34 hours of failed attempts. I never said I was a God Gamer, but I thought I at least had a modicum of talent worthy to defeat these final bosses and become Elden Lord. Dear Christ in Heaven. I use to love the music of Elden Beast. It sparked wonder and awe from within the deepest chambers of my soul. And now? It haunts me in my dreams. Taunts me. There is no God. Only suffering. This damn cosmic slug! It spews it‚Äôs gold frothy light at me. It flings its galaxy smog at my face. It hurls its homing stars as I try to flee and fail. This damn cosmic slug pounds my flesh to a celestial pulp, deconstructing my atoms until I am nothing but stardust floating in a sea of a black void. There is no God. Only suffering. How many hours will I continue to torment myself? How many more days will I submit myself as a mere plaything for the Beast called Elden? Fortnite would never hurt me like this? And yet, I crave to be hurt. ‚ÄúTomorrow will be better,‚Äù I shout into the abyss. ‚ÄúTomorrow I will become Elden Lord!‚Äù Copium, sweet, sweet, copium..................................

good game
Definitely one of the best games FromSoftware created ever, in Top Five.
Now that finished everything in the game, I gotta say, didn't expect the Diallos & Jar quest would be this good. How Diallos changed during the story, Jar's ambitions, the ending... really liked this quest. I don't need to talk about bae quests, Ranni's and Millicent's :D
In the end, I have to say Frenzied Flame Ending was a God-Tier ending. The music, the set, the theme... everything about it was amazing.
Now it's time to wait for DLC!
Awesome game ! Dlc i am ready !üëä
absolutely immense game. my only real complaint is there isnt much guidance on how to follow quests so i feel like i need to have the wiki up when i play

[h3] Not sure what all the hype is about [/h3]
It's a good game, sure... but after beating it, there isn't much to do. It would be cool if they added [b] loot boxes [/b] to the dungeons for a chance at getting legendary items, or at the very least, a [b] battle pass [/b] to keep things interesting.
This game is also missing the option for a [b] first person mode! [/b] Should always be an option in modern gaming.
Overall, this game feels pretty dated, will change my review if the DLC will add these features.

everything in this game wants to kill u.
i just spent 60 dollars on this game.  everytime i turn in the game it becomes laggy. but when i just move it doesnt and its honestly just annoying and even tho im on the lowest settings it still does it its so fucking annoying if anyone can reply and maybe fix this please do.
this game is awful don't buy it -Dylan Barr
Overwhelmingly hard, Overwhelmingly annoying, Overwhelmingly love it.
I feel emboldened by the flame of ambition
It's alright.
Amazing story, amazing visuals, amazing bossfights, better than ds1r, 10/10.
I had several hundred hours on the xbox version and was about to complete ng+4 when I made the jump to PC. Couldn't recommend it enough, the difference in gameplay and feel is astronomical. Highly recommend making the switch to PC for stable framerates and better picture quality.
can hug woman
It's the most beautiful game I've ever played in my life up to this point.
elden ring (and the dark souls series as a whole) is as close as it comes to being a berserk game without actually being a berserk game
I have played previous From Software games like Dark Souls 1 and 2 and it was clear that the controlls were wnot made for PC keyboard and mouse and the camera was awful getting stuck in corners and walls, they were clearly poor conole ports for PC. 
After all the praise I saw about Elden Ring I thougth to try it out thinking that maybe this time they did a good job porting it for PC but I was mistaken. The camera controlls are better but the lock on feature is horrible on PC keyboard and mouse. You are trying to lock on to the Horse boss at the beginning and when he rushes you and  is in front of some goats the lock switches to the goats as if I am trying to fight the goats at trhat moment. From software has never made a good port for PC and I was deluded in thinking that they would. This is a horrible game for PC with mouse and keyboard. Not recomended. This is a 0/10 for me.
The ring was in fact elden, 10/10
Ranni:)
BEST GAME EVER
The game play, graphics, plot, story, boss fights are all amazing and great fun; this coupled with the eerie yet thrilling vibe make it the best game I have played. 10/10 recommended.
i am no longer  maidenless
cancer game its perfect
big sword go brrrrrrr
Give up on your foolish ambitions
Its pretty alright
I sure love being scammed by "Deluxe edition" that for price of almost 2nd full game gave mediocre soundtrack and average artbook. 40 more bucks for "DLC"? Nah, not htis time.
great game, i wish there were more poison lakes, rats and dogs tho
[h1] It is mind-blowing, how much Fromsoft has put in this game. [/h1]
The open world never feels empty, and you really feel (and get) rewarded for exploring every nook and cranny.
The diversity of the areas and the enemies and the scale of certain structures is also amazing!
Add to that the large variety of weapons, spells, summons etc. and you can customise your character however you want!
I am only 35 hours in, but this [i] might [/i] just be the best Souls game!
Game slaps me around like my childhood. 10/10
Ich love this game my ex is probably gay now
One of the greatest games ever made.
10/10 One of my favorite games of all time
Dark Souls 3 is better then elden ring i only enjoy elden ring for the bosses and thats it parry in this game is weird hitting is good. Horse is terrible i hate it to move around the map and killing bosses with the horse. and the most unfair gameplay in elden ring it has to be getting hit through walls and even in the boss fight arena getting hit by enemies at the door when im in a boss fight they not supposed to hit you Fix your game. In dark souls 3 none of that parry is good getting it through walls None Dark souls 3 is just better in general. I would rafter to play dark souls not elden ring in my mind. If this is your first dark souls game i say go buy dark souls 3 first then think about getting elden ring, Elden ring has alot of bugs but is a good game if you know where togo Some area is hard and some is not. I give elden ring a 7.5/10 is a fun game but i prefer to play dark souls 3 then elden ring bc elden ring has a lot of bugs. but for dark souls 3 zero bugs
Love the game. The bosses have their own battle themes and you've got many weapons to choose from, many playstyles also. Nice replayability and i can merely wait for the new dlc! I can only recommand the game. Do not get this if you don't like soulslike games that include a lot of trial and error(dying a bunch of times) at the beginning. Have fun!
Best FromSoft game.
Absolutely beautiful game, graphics look awesome, story telling is great!
Overall the game is a pain in the ass as the first souls game for me.
Awesome game
yeah
Another amazing instalment in the From Software game library. 

Essentially, this is a proper open world Dark Souls game which worked wonderfully, the story is top notch and graphics are beautiful.

For me personally, I find games that are completely open world can be overwhelming and I struggle to do more than 1 playthrough since it has a feeling of a massive time sink as I always want to do everything in these types of games. I managed to get all achievements apart from 2 endings as I have only finished 1 playthrough.

I am 100% a PvE player and dislike PvP, so I can't really comment on the PvP side of the game other than it is very popular.
peak.
I will walk with you
O DEATH BECOME MY BLADE ONCE MORE!
FINALLY NOT GAME SHARING THIS GAME ANYMORE SO I CAN WRITE A REVIEW ON THIS GAME Elden Ring is arguably the best game in the series, delivering an expansive and fascinating open world that's a joy to explore. The landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful, truly some of the best visuals seen in gaming. Each area is packed with secrets and challenges that keep you engaged for hours. The bosses are a standout feature; they're brilliantly designed and offer a tough but fair challenge, although a few do repeat throughout the game. Devs really nailed the climactic feel with the last two bosses‚Äîboth feel like true final bosses and provide a satisfying end to an epic journey. I enjoyed Elden Ring so much that I couldn't stop until I had unlocked all the achievements. It's a masterpiece that's not to be missed.


gud game
I am obsessed with this game and get mad that i cant roll in other games now.
this game is not bad
.
not dark souls 2 pretty gay
ds2 but open world
Eh... it's better than many other AAA titles out there but within it's own genre of FromSoft games I had far less fun than in DS1. Running around in the open world that has nothing else other than monsters has little interactivity with it, it's not like I'm going to affect the world, and it's not a historical world where I can learn something fun along the way either... it just feels pointless, as in, I could just "walk around and kill everything" even without open world, so why add it, other than making me ride a horse and teleport a lot.
olhuohophi
lit
I broke 10 controllers while fighting Melenia.
worth every penny!!!
who doesn't love this game? just shut up already. SHUT UP AND BUY IT
hell yeah
why no 21:9 support on pc. great game - played it on xbox series x and ps5. wanted to play on PC, but black bars left and right, come on guys.
fuck yeah
goated
I've tried playing this game several times over, but each time something stops me.

I do appreciate the open world. At times, it is stunningly beautiful. Enough for an Explorer like myself to fall in love with. But contrast this with the other Souls games and this one is only marginally better than Dark Souls III, and that one was garbage in my opinion. Most don't share that view, especially not since DS1 and DS2, along with Demon's Souls are my favorites and no doubt will certain readers such as potentially you discredit my view as nothing more than "git gud" because how dare I criticize what you love.

Frankly, here's my issue with Elden Ring.
The controls, are godawful. No matter how I try to rebind them, I sincerely hate them. I never feel like I am in control of my character, I am a slave to the will of the game. After a while I may adapt, but it's not a fun time. Even after adapting fully to the controls, it just never feels as good as the others did. It's certainly no Dragon's Dogma, but it's hard to beat perfection. Imagine if this game was just as fluid as DD is. Then it could certainly be something wonderful.

So take this with a grain of salt.
You may end up loving this game.
But the controls ruin any kind of enjoyment.

A fun game with TONS of mythology and lore, but most of it makes little to no sense, honestly.  After 6 hours, I gave up trying to understand the game and just reveled in the boss battles. So... many... boss battles...

its perfect, i love it
It took me a little over 2 years for me to beat Elden Ring picking it up and putting it down when I would feel some burnout. As someone who naturally explores as much as they can I found that the game was full of surprises and would give you a whole arsenal of "tools" that you could use whenever you got stuck. It's one of those games that doesn't require you to explore but definitely rewards it if you do. The bosses felt fair and each time you die you felt like you were "downloading" their move set and getting better. With the ability to make the game as easy or hard as you want by using a plethora of different items, summons, and weapons it feels like it has a lot of repeatability which is something I'd want from a game that makes you want to stay in its world. Overall I'd say it was a great game and is definitely worth the challenge if you want to pick it up. I'm excited for the DLC and what that has to bring but for now I'll leave you with a rating of 9/10

TLDR: 9/10 
Exploration is fun in this 1 but the bosses bring it home
more like SMELLden ring!!
yes it is fun but it is the harest game iver ever played
harder to get to the boss than fight the boss

one of the best games i've ever played, and imho, one of the best games of all time. the world building is amazing, characters are interesting, and the feeling of beating a boss is a top 5 feeling of all time.
100/10
A very fun game. a few problems such as other players invading your world in multiplayer, so if you want to play this with your friends, i dont reccomend.
If you want to play the game by yourself it is a great game, just be warnned of the multiplayer inconvenience.

Loved the game on PS%, bought the PC version to enjoy widescreen. No widescreen support. Refunded.
Amazing story! I would expect nothing less from a souls game!

This game is very beautiful, It challenges your skills and has a great story.
this game is so bad lmao uninstall before its too late.
Dont do it.
Finished the game 3 times on my own and still playing the coop mod with friends. Best game i have played in my life. but its not for everyone. <3
may chaos take the world
i refuse to believe that this dumbass game got game of the year it makes no sense. in my experience i have found and confronted the most bullshit shit off all time. the boss godfrey is the hardest in the game and melania is easier than margitt. i do not recommend buying this piece of shit game.
:p
hard but good
It good thats all you need to know
Highest endorsement. Play without info or guides and luxuriate in exploring a beautiful, brutal world, with well-balanced but challenging exp and equip pacing, a sense of destinations in the vistas with almost continuous expansions in magnitude of a fantastic world, and decent diversity in build-based playstyle (I've now played four). Pay attention during cut-scenes, as conversation history is not immediately available. The story reveals itself in a convoluted but fun way, so pay attention to all dialogue, equipment info, etc. to tease out the grand narrative. Warrants multiple playthroughs and thus high value for money. I recommend playing with settings as high as possible while maintaining a consistent chop-free framerate. I turn down settings as I go. A long, rich, adventure of the highest order.
10/10 -- ruined my marriage but worth it
For lovers of Dark Souls, this game is a must play!
I beat the game on my 8gb ram toaster at 25 fps (including Malenia) so ya'll have no excuses.
Also ... ez.
Only if you accept all the suffering, all the pain, all the frustration, all, that makes you wanting to quit... only then you will see all the beauty of this game. 
Then, you will realise, what this game really means and you will apreciate all that torture you¬¥ve been through.

Just let the game guide you through your journey, it is all worth what it costs.

PS: Malenia best boss fight I could imagine, just do it
Good
It won game of the year, what else is there to say. 

I don't even think I'm half way through it but I am confident that I will at least triple my play time I currently have as of writing this review (35 hours, edited after I beat the game at 68 hours.) 

With so many builds, so many different ways to play this game and quite literally the best environments/setting in a video game I have ever played.

This game is now my favorite game of all time. What a masterpiece.


Finally, Dark Souls 2-2
game is good soup :>
Wow...
Fun game, hate the camping MFs that jump on co-op games. Assholes got nothing better to do than sit on a tower and kill every under powered co-op that tries to get close.

This game is a masterpiece in every single sense of the word. There will likely never be another game that achieves what Elden Ring has and if there is, it'll probably be another FromSoftware game anyway. I could write a 500 page essay on why this game is so perfect but I'll just say this instead - 

If you love Dark Souls games, play this. 
If you've never played a Dark Souls game, play this. 
If you don't like Dark Souls games, play this.

If you are a 1st time souls-like player dont expect to be good at it. The combat is just great and exploring is a thing in this game too. Basicly you choose the difficulty by getting the right equipment for a certiant boss or an enemy. Definitly recomend it, also im a first time souls-like player and im not complaining too much about how difficult this game is.
The game beat me. 10/10

I have to admit something, I‚Äôve only ever beaten Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2. I got lost in DS1 after Nito. Once I moved towards the end of DS3 I got busy and never returned. And when I reached the final boss in Sekiro‚Ä¶. Well, I just couldn‚Äôt do it. And finally, Elden Ring. I didn‚Äôt finish Elden Ring. 

I don‚Äôt know why yet, maybe that‚Äôs the point of this review. What made me stop? I remember having done so much. I went down into the deep caverns of The Lands Between, went far off to meet Ranni, rejected the serpent king and his advances, fought the giants, and just to save everyone here from my ramblings; I eventually made it all the way to Morgott. I killed Morgott. But then I stopped. Just kind of, dropped it. 

Perhaps a realization hits me while playing From Softwares games. A realization that I will have to keep pushing through over and over again, and that the time to do this could otherwise be spent completing other games or activities. But isn‚Äôt that silly? Games are meant to be experienced! Not just another task to scratch off the list, right!? Hm, well, what if the experience is robbing you of other experiences? What if, over the course of many years, I‚Äôve already had this experience before. Dodge, attack, get hit, heal, dodge, dodge, attack, attack, run. I‚Äôve done these same things, continued to memorize enemy patterns over and over again, went to the same screen to check if a new items stats warrant swapping out. 
But isn‚Äôt that just games? Like, most games in one way or another?

Am I bored of games? Do I not like these games? Am I not good? Can I never be good? Why am I doing this? What‚Äôs the point of any of it? Should I finally just give up? Should I put my foolish ambitions to rest?

The game beat me 10/10.
I don't understand anything in this game but it's very interesting

The experience of playing Elden Ring for the first time is perhaps one of the greatest things I have experienced in my entire life of gaming. The sense of wonder, the sheer size of the game, the polished gameplay, incredible aesthetic, and just the unbelievably consistent level of quality throughout such a massive project is astounding.

200 hours for one single playthrough - loved every second of it.
It‚Äôs pretty cool.

One of the greatest games of all time. dog.

While a big fan of previous Fromsoftware games, Elden Ring I feel was a bad step out of the Dark Souls mold that they've so perfected by the sole choice of making the game open world. While very impressive at first, I do feel that this single action has greatly hampered the game in terms of progressing, finding quests and special objects, and keeping to areas your meant to as it is very easy to find yourself in a much higher level area than your suppose to be simply by riding your horse for a bit. Furthermore, the enemies within Elden ring get tiresome fairly quickly due to there not being a large variety of enemies like previous titles, with several of the main enemies simply being reskinned multiple times to fit different kingdoms and given one to two new attacks and atop of that, if you have played previous FS games, one is likely to note that some enemies are simple reskins of other game's enemies. The story also I feel is not as good as previous games with it feeling more like a generic fantasy universe as opposed to something grim like Bloodborne or, as mentioned a few times, Dark Souls, even though it continues to play with the whole "Life and Death" cycle that the DS series has done, though it just is not as good (For spoilers, search Youtube). While I like many of the locations, armors, weapons, and the new mount system, I was not greatly impressed by gameplay or story, which I feel was hampered by their choice to go open world, as opposed to say similar to original dark souls but larger maps, as it is very easy to miss things to help you in quests or to simply fail quests as you progressed too far into one area or simply never met them due to not finding them, this game is VERY difficult to play without a wiki and map opened up on a browser, much more than previous game and a problem I never really had in the earlier games thanks to quests being easier to find and complete thanks to these smaller locations. So, while a pretty game with some improvements to Souls-like games, I find this ultimately is a step backwards as opposed to forward in terms of quality and playability.
died over 200 times lost count after that wolf in the caslte 10/10
jork peanits when ranni
Did not dislike anything. Great game!
First things first, After 120 hours of experience in this game as my first fromsoftware game i can say 1 thing  straight. This game is NOT FOR EVERYONE. If you don't have patience and and u don't enjoy open world without lots of navigation you will have hard time. I had to use ER wiki to find out most of stuff. The game is very punishing. A game where every death has to be meaningful. If you still decide to play it this game will stay  with you for a while. Its hell of a good experience with crazy story and graphics. At some point of game when u start building towards you endgame build u become more and more crazy and you can recover from your mistakes pretty much fast. Becoming the elder lord after that long and painful road is the most excited thing i ever experienced in my gaming carrier. 
Overall i do recommend it my Elden Ring rating is 8/10. Don't get me wrong its great game it was just not my cup of tea. It require so much commitment and strategy and patience something i don't most of the times when i come back from work. But in other hand if you have a lot of free time and u want to spend more than 150 hours in game. Than this will be the game for you.
Best moments:
1. Boss fights. (Most cinematic boss fights in my life esp Radhan Event)
2. Different builds and game play options.
3. Ending and late game.
4. Geting Rewarded for exploratin.
5. When u start understanding how the game works its becomes so fun and addicitive.

Worst parts.
1.Not enough navigation outside of yellow graces on map.
2.So many things you can miss because game does not tell u what to do or where to go.
3.The zones are not with level sign (You can go in level 90 zone as level 35 and geting 1 shoted, because the game is way to open)
4..Outside of 1 tutorial in start you have nothing else to teach you how to become better.

Graphics,Combat and Story is really on point. 
I just wish i had quest Journal or something and more navigation.
Once again overall 8/10.

My biggest advice: Do not get discouraged. Do not be afraid. If you die go some where else you can always skip and come back later. Death is not ending. Death is lesson. If i did you can do it too !



"Marika's tit's"

Love the game. as some one who has never play any fromsoft game before in the past, this is my first game getting into it and its super fun, it made me want to try out all the other souls game after completing this game.
1. 60 fps lock
2. no ultrawide screen support in 2024
Ahh... Suffering...
Best game I've ever played.
dope
good game
literally my favorite game of all time. i dont care if you dont like souls likes or rpgs or whatever just stfu and play it you wont regret it

goat
The only moment that mattered was being held by Fia
Was always hesitant to start this game but now I can't put the game down. 1000% recommend to anyone.
9/10 I beat the game but at what cost? Definitely didn't die more than 1000 times.
shit game
yes very old rings yes very ring yes old very yes would reccomend yes again
not bad
spent 100 hours playing this game, and another 100 dying to large men

10/10

bring me more large men
Well finally finished my first play through. Yes it took 2 years for me to finish lol(stop playing for awhile and Bg3 came out) but I love and hate this game. So top tier gaming. 
Bear Witness!
This might be the greatest game ever made.
best game
It would be a blasphemy not to recommend this game. But as with all souls like games, not for the faint of heart.
if you're in to self-harm this is for you
Good game.
Top
Amazing game that lets you explore a whole world with different areas, all with outstanding scenery, music and great bosses. The main story is an unforgettable masterpiece, second to none. Though the best part ofc is Ranni the four armed witch, that finally can rid you of your maidenless title :)
Very good Immersive rpg game
Diving into Elden Ring, I found myself enraptured by a game that masterfully blends dark fantasy with open-world exploration. From the moment I set foot in the Lands Between, I knew I was in for an unforgettable experience.

Elden Ring's gameplay hooked me from the start. It retains the hallmark challenging combat that FromSoftware is renowned for, demanding precision, strategy, and patience. Yet, the open-world aspect introduced a new level of freedom that was both exhilarating and daunting. Exploring the vast, interconnected world at my own pace, discovering hidden dungeons, and engaging in spontaneous battles kept the experience fresh and exciting.

Riding my spectral steed, Torrent, across diverse landscapes‚Äîfrom eerie swamps to towering mountains‚Äîwas a delight. The ability to traverse such a large world with fluidity and speed added a new dimension to exploration. The game's world felt alive, with secrets lurking around every corner, beckoning me to uncover them.

Elden Ring is visually stunning. The art direction, blending gothic and fantastical elements, created a world that was both haunting and beautiful. The detail in the environments, from crumbling ruins to lush forests, was captivating. The game‚Äôs lighting and atmospheric effects further enhanced the sense of immersion.

The sound design and music also stood out. The ambient sounds heightened the tension during exploration, while the orchestral score added grandeur to the epic battles. The audio experience was integral to the overall atmosphere, making every moment feel significant and immersive.

On the technical front, Elden Ring performed admirably on my system. The game ran smoothly with only occasional minor hiccups, which were quickly overshadowed by the sheer enjoyment of the experience. It‚Äôs clear that FromSoftware put considerable effort into optimizing the game for a wide range of hardware.

Elden Ring exceeded my expectations in every way. It‚Äôs a game that not only challenges but also deeply rewards those who invest their time and effort. The combination of an expansive open world, intricate combat mechanics, and a richly woven narrative made it a standout experience. Whether you‚Äôre a die-hard Souls fan or a newcomer to FromSoftware‚Äôs games, Elden Ring offers a journey that is as breathtaking as it is brutal. For me, it was an unforgettable adventure through a mesmerizing and unforgiving world.
gud
hard af as usual
i love everything about this game
i don't understand why people love this game so much, its just a bland open world with an empty map,reused bosses and  uninteresting loot, i wish they just gave us something like ds3 or bloodborne it could've been much better. and don't get me started with the awful performance, iam really disappointed in fromsoft this time.
hopefully these issues would get fixed in the dlc
Greatest Game of All Time
ez game
Great game, I have so much fun playing it. Would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about purchasing a game.
constantly crashing and freezing my pc, which is annoying! the world of this game is 10/10 but thats about as far as they did good, combat is lazy and messy and they credit themselves by it for just saying thats how they design it to be hard. bosses skills and moves and abillities go through solid structures etc that just seems sloppy in designs. what keeps you playing this trash game is the desire to beat it and hate it afterwards. as its not worth the attention or awards it got. fights like the dark cruicble twins at the auriza hero grave have just annoyed me beyond any kind of negative feeling a game should do. these kinda poorly designed fights arent fair or skillfully designed, there just a very poor careless mess the devs think are challenging . lets the rest a game down
great game
walahi 10/10 game please play it it is peak one of the best games ive ever played. ive even 100% -ted the game
What if the Elden Ring is just a moldy onion ring?
make me go happy not sad
Fun
Absolutely fantastic, I finished it 4 times before on other platform without any summons and all optional areas. A must-play game.
YES CHAT WE DID IT!!!
[h1]Elden Ring: A Sprawling Open-World Adventure[/h1]

Elden Ring offers players a vast open world to explore, filled with a multitude of locations waiting to be discovered. The lore woven throughout the map enriches every corner, creating a puzzle that players piece together bit by bit. The combat system is more dynamic than ever, with numerous possible builds to experiment with. However, it's worth noting that the monsters are significantly stronger than those in From Software's previous games, although some may find that the diversity of builds makes the game easier than previous "soul" titles.

The game also boasts a diverse range of atmospheres, from tranquil plains to decrepit ruins, and from putrid lakes to snow-capped mountains. While there is a plethora of monsters to encounter, some players may lament the reuse of bosses, diminishing the variety of encounters relative to the size of the world. However, the game makes up for this with its intriguing magic system, which offers players a refreshing approach to combat.

Elden Ring's lore is exceptionally rich, crafted in collaboration with acclaimed author George R. R. Martin. Hidetaka Miyazaki's vision to explore a new type of game, blending open-world exploration with the hallmark challenges of a "soul" game, is executed masterfully. However, some players may feel that the simplicity of character builds has been sacrificed in the process.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a triumph of world-building and storytelling, offering players a captivating journey through a sprawling and immersive world. While it may not be without its flaws, its ambition and depth make it a must-play for fans of open-world RPGs and From Software's previous titles alike.

very good

I enjoyed it,  some areas really take your breath away, other areas are pain.  overall it's a unique experience where you can immerse yourself for a couple hours and challenge yourself in your own terms.
One of the greatest gaming experiences of the past decade, the exploration, the gear and build options and the freedom to go wherever ya want are ace!
I mean ... good luck.
great game, made me bald and i m seeing therapist regarding my anger issues. 10/10 would recommend!
whoever thought delay attacks were a good idea, fuck you
Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.
fun and cancer at the same time
I did it.
mmm
FromSoftware can't be bothered to properly port their game to PC so I can't be bothered to leave a proper review

If you are looking to venture forth into the Soulsborne catalog, I would highly suggest starting with Elden Ring. This game is the definition of excellence in the genre. An absolute masterpiece and one of the finest games I have ever had the chance to play. I have been playing video games for about 25 years now and I have never been so enraptured by a video game than I did with Elden Ring.

I loved the game so much that I originally played it on PS5 and then bought it here on Steam and replayed it to get ready for Shadow of the Erdtree.

I am so ready for Shadow of the Erdtree! Cannot wait!

Give this a go and persevere through it all.. you will not regret it. Ten out of Ten.
Nah, I'd Win.
good game
The GOAT.

Also please bring Bloodborne to PC.

Probably Fromsoft's best game. I'm burnt out on the repeated Dark Souls formula and with this game essentially being Dark Souls 4 it's too much of the same for me. If you're not burnt out on Souls you will most likely enjoy this game.
best souls game ever made
ngl they kinda cooked with this one too

One of my top games the feeling of it is so perfect


Very challeging, but not so as the other fromsoft series
,asterpiece at mi0hjn qupw)h d)

.
Elden Ring is one of those games that you just need to play at least once in your life. It's probably the closest to an actual work of art mixed in with a combo of some of FromSoft's previous games.

The game's music and art direction is so perfect for the setting being presented, and felt incredibly immersive for me. The music feels as though it belongs in a movie with how dramatic and beautiful it sounds. Probably the best in FromSoft's lineup of games in my opinion. Elden Ring's art direction is also phenomenal in about every way. The only gripe I have about it, although it may be just my own opinion, is that some parts and areas get a tad redundant and some parts recycle enemies and ideas from other sections, but it's not enough to say it's bad. 

Open world in the game is also pretty interesting and does a decent job making sure the player always has something to do, and of course has some of the best vistas I've seen in a game. Honestly I took a little too many screenshots it's so good lmao. Seeing parts of the map that I couldn't get to made me explore looking for ways to get to where I wanted/needed to go, and rather than just being a straight shot to my destination, the game always threw a number of different things that would get me sidetracked and I'd end up going on like three other whole little adventures before doing what I set out to do. It's very good for an open world.

The gameplay, I think, is a great combo of Dark Souls, Bloodbourn, and even Sekiro thrown in. FromSoft seems as though they wanted to bring the best of their older games into one, and did that they did. It really opens up the world for exploration, brings out the most interesting combat to always keep you on your toes, and has amazing locations that allow for exploration so you can find different paths through the area with many goodies to find. 

The story is about as insane as you'd expect. It's FromSoft.

The game's insanely good, if you're reading this just thinking about getting the game just get it. Don't think about it, just get it and enjoy it. Trust.
good

elden ring !!!
I PLAY, I DESTROY, I UNINSTALL (REPEAT)
Great Game
amazing worth every penny
It's just that good. It's easy to see why it has won so many awards and Honestly with 200+ hours in the game it has almost infinite replaybility. Every time I start a new Game file I find something new that I hadn't discovered before in previous Saves. Not a veteran From Soft fan. this was the first toe I've dipped into the From soft Franchise and it has me wanting to torture myself more in the likes of Sekiro and Bloodborn as well as other Souls games.
My favourite game of 2022, I played over 250 hours on PS4. The best parts of this game are:
[list]
    [*]Many great challenging bosses, especially towards the end of the game. It was really fun to beat all bosses on RL1. Top 3 bosses imo are [spoiler]Malenia, Mohg, and Horah Loux[/spoiler].
    [*]Despite what some people think, the combat system is amazing, fair, and well designed. The combat is similar to Dark Souls 3 but improved. Jump attacks are a great addition too. Also easy mode does exist, its called using magic and ash summons.
    [*]The world is very pretty especially with a reshade mod for PC.
    [*]The added quality of life features such as the stake of marika which respawns you right before boss is a great addition.
    [*]The lore is very interesting.
[/list]

The downsides of the game, while fairly minor, are:
[list]
    [*]Not all bosses are designed the best. Particularly, fromsoft seem to not be able to pull off duo boss fights (demon princes from DS3 is the only exception). 
    [*]While the open world was okay to try and is done better than most big dev studios, its makes the game have less replayability. I've beat the game 6 times, and at this point I just run through the open world, get key items and stick mostly to the legacy dungeons and certain caves. I miss the compact level design of Dark Souls 1.
    [*]There should be less weapons. For example, club and stone club are basically the same but one does more damage. I wish they designed the weapons like Bloodborne where each weapon is unique.
[/list]

Overall still an amazing game. I'm hyped the for the DLC :D
made my soul feel more fulfilled than sex.
It has got the things that I didn't know that I wanted.
W Game
very fun game, but it is confusing at first and i had to look up guides for absolutetly everything on my first playthrough but all in all, it was really fun playing the story

One of the greatest games ever made.
This is probably one of my favorite games of all time. Seemingly infinite replayability, a nice number of endings, fun combat to learn (if not to deal with) and so many great builds and weapons to try. More than worth the cost to play and enjoy, especially since you can even do so with a couple of friends.

Elden Ring Review: A Masterpiece of Modern Gaming
Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)

Visuals and World-Building:
Elden Ring‚Äôs world is a visual feast, boasting stunningly detailed landscapes that range from lush, verdant forests to desolate, haunting wastelands. Each area is meticulously crafted, brimming with secrets waiting to be uncovered. The interconnected open world is a marvel, offering seamless transitions between diverse environments that invite endless exploration.

The challenging yet fair difficulty ensures that every victory feels hard-earned and immensely satisfying.

Story and Lore:
The narrative of Elden Ring, enriched by George R.R. Martin's storytelling genius, is an intricate web of lore and mythology.

Audio and Soundtrack:
The audio design in Elden Ring is impeccable, with a soundtrack that enhances every moment of the game. The haunting melodies and powerful orchestral scores are perfectly suited to the game's epic scope, while the ambient sounds bring the world to life. From the quiet rustling of leaves to the thunderous roar of a boss battle, the soundscape is immersive and evocative.

Conclusion:
Elden Ring is a landmark achievement in the world of gaming. It seamlessly combines the challenging gameplay that FromSoftware is known for with an expansive, richly detailed world and a deeply engaging story. Whether you are a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer eager to explore its depths, Elden Ring offers an unparalleled adventure that will leave a lasting impression.

Priced at around $59.99, Elden Ring is a must-have for any gaming enthusiast. Its extraordinary blend of artistry, challenge, and storytelling makes it not just a game, but a profound experience that redefines what is possible in the medium.
this game is like drugs you'll do it because its fun and you can stop whenever you want.
i like it.good game.If your a chad, play this 10/10 masterpiece.
good game
I fucking hate this game
My God, this game is amazing. I want to spend my whole life in Elden Ring world. I fell in love with this game.
fun and hard just never got to mad yes i did quit sometimes but i came back that day
Very easy game
This game is great, but it isn't as friendly to noobs as most others
A tragic, brutal, and beautiful world, From Software truly succeeds in building a world that is not only inrapturous to get lost in, but translated into lessons in my own life. I cannot recommend this game and the rest of from software's library enough
Good Game
I absolutely loved this game! I had it since launch but couldn't get into it. Until recently and i loved it. it was one of the best games I've ever played. i was intimidated by its challenge but i over thought it. This has got to be one of the most rewarding games I've ever played. I'm now playing the other souls games that i imagined would be to difficult. Loving those as well definitely not as much as Elden Ring. I highly recommend this title.
i hate my life
It's a very fun open world game that you  can play for hours and not get boared.
Y E S
best game ahead
Try finger but hole
.
:)
Big Sword energy.
try finger but whole

I like yes:)
skill needed
it was sometimes insanely difficult but at the same time I also beat elden beast on my first try. Fun
They nerfed everything in this game and buffed some of the bosses. Yes I love this game but seriously i have plus 9 blasphemous blade and im making no progress against Niall wtf.  My first playthrough it only took me twice.   Amazing game but the patches keep getting worse
this game is so cool
8.6/10 - from a person who dosen't like open world games

easier than DS3 even without summons (I would Recommend not using any weapons that use somber smithing stones for a DS3 difficulty {non magic}).¬†however this game is much better than DS3 if not just for the Stakes of Marikas and Torrent witch make the game so much more fun to play and tbh it would go from a 8.6/10 (harsh btw) to a 6.5/10 dew to how frustrating it would be to play without these two features.
elden ring is the best game that has the best players and I would totally recomend

This game is definitely among the best I've ever played, absolutely deserved winning GOTY.

Exploration and curiosity are really rewarded - and sometimes punished with bosses or traps but it's a Soulslike, so what did I expect - although sometimes the map can get a bit big and daunting. The boss design is really great and versatile with a little bit of everything to make sure things stay fresh. Builds are also versatile and easily respeccable thanks to Rennala and the rebirth mechanic; additionally most upgrade materials become an unlimited resource once you're far enough into the game allowing for a wide variety of weapons to be used without having to settle on a single weapon and playstyle too early. The combat is as you would expect it from a FromSoft Soulslike, challenging and rewarding.

All in all an amazing game and I can't wait for Shadows of the Erdtree
Incroyable, le jeu me donnait pas envie de base mais depuis que j'y joue je me r√©gale
awesome game play it
What words can even describe this game? It's a generational experience.
I've played 150 hours at the time of this review, and I can say, having beaten the game 4 times with and without others, that it is a masterpiece of its time and kind. It may not be as good as Bloodborne, but it sure does hold a special place in my game library, right at the top.
100% the game kinda ez
it fun me bonk
eden runk
It's just a flat out fun challenge with a lot of depth to go into, but even if you don't know what you're doing, slap 40 points into vigor and the rest into your weapon scaling and you're set.
It really is as good as they say :)

Good Game 5/7
Dette spillet har funnet seg hele veien til midten av hjertet mitt. Det er ingen annen vei √• forklare dette spillet enn sjarmerende, facisnerende, flott, fortryllende, praktfull, str√•lende, sv√¶rt ekstrodin√¶r, meget imponerende, enest√•ende, praktisk, l√¶ringsrik, magefullende, j√∏rdberet p√• toppen av kaken, guddommelig, overjordisk og ypperlig vidunderlig. Men, det er en s√•kalt Elden Ring sjef med navn Malenia, Blade of Miquella som gj√∏r denne overjordiske spillet til en mindre praktfult spill. Tilslutt, min annmeldelse p√• spillet m√• nesten ligge p√• en 3/10, p√• grunn av denne sjefen Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
the best gateway drug for getting into the other fromsoft games
good game
Guys, after thousands of attempts, I finally beat Soldier of God, Rick.
thank you GOAT Miyazaki
WOW! JUST WOW! AMAZING GAME! CANT WAIT FOR THE DLC!
When this game won game of the year i was dissapointed and wondered why everyone loved it so much. After several months i decided to buy this game and it has completly changed the way that i view it. The game is a ton of fun and it drove me to buy the first 3 darksouls as well. Heres to hoping that the DLC is just as good.
too easy game, make it harder next ime

What I love about ELDEN RING is that i can i can hopelessly die an uncountable amount of times and the game is still rewarding, exciting and enjoyable. This is my first souls-like and is vastly different in gameplay than my other games, but I love it and very excited for the upcoming DLC coming in June.

THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE! 

To set the stage, all you know from the outset is that you play as a ‚ÄúTarnished‚Äù of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. What that actually means, how one might go about doing that, and what the deal is with that giant glowing golden tree are all things that you have to discover yourself. Like other FromSoft games, the grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there‚Äôs no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours. There really should be, but it is a story I nonetheless enjoyed trying to piece together for myself. I look forward to supplementing that knowledge with the inevitable painstakingly detailed lore videos that emerge from the community later. 

It ended up being the organic side stories that kept me most enthralled rather than the grand overarching plot that credits Game of Thrones‚Äô George R.R. Martin as its scenario writer. FromSoft smartly doesn‚Äôt change much in its approach to these from the Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro; you‚Äôll just naturally meet characters as you explore and discover the world and become involved in their problems. There are no ‚Äú!‚Äù markers on the map, no waypoints to guide you to them, and these characters don‚Äôt always flag you down or initially want or need anything from you. They‚Äôre just people with their own agendas and goals, whose stories are impacted based on your own actions or inactions. 

I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map.

That was actually kind of refreshing in an open world as vast as this one, and it was always exciting to see a familiar face pop up again later as I was eager to learn about what brought them to this new part of the world and how their journey had progressed. The trade-off, of course, is that without any markers, quest log, or journal, it becomes very easy to forget about certain plot threads and accidentally leave them unresolved by the end. That‚Äôs a bummer, and I‚Äôve already felt regret at missing out on stories that some of my colleagues have had ‚Äì but for me it was worth it, because even after 87 hours, I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map absolutely full of unresolved sidequest markers. Besides, any missed quests give me extra incentive to continue onto New Game+. 

‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù is the word that every aspect of Elden Ring‚Äôs design connects back to. From the moment you set foot in Limgrave, the first of many interconnected regions of The Lands Between, you are completely free to go wherever you want. And sure, that‚Äôs far from a new concept in open-world games, but the way it's handled here is truly extraordinary. If you wanted to, you could be an explorer and spend hours upon hours in Limgrave, delving into every mini dungeon, fighting every boss, discovering every NPC, and leveling yourself up to better prepare for what‚Äôs next. Alternatively, you could follow the Light of Grace, guiding you toward the main path and the first major dungeon ‚Äì or you could find a hidden path to a new region that‚Äôs meant for higher levels and completely bypass the first major dungeon entirely! Maybe even steal yourself a cool weapon early while you‚Äôre there. 

A few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness.
Again, this is not unprecedented, but a few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. For one, Elden Ring doesn‚Äôt scale enemy levels to match your own at all, so jumping into a later region means you‚Äôre always dealing with stronger enemies, making the risk/reward prospect of doing so very real. But perhaps more notably, the way its different areas are connected makes finding these new ones more than a simple matter of choosing a direction and heading towards it. Limgrave is designed very specifically with a main path in mind that takes you through Stormveil Castle, and finding a way around that truly feels like you‚Äôve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I‚Äôve explored.

You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous FromSoft game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there‚Äôs now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill. 

Elden Ring's difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre.
The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games ‚Äì weapon affinities and weapon skills ‚Äì by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let‚Äôs say I find a really good rapier and I really like the moveset, but I‚Äôm building my character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won‚Äôt get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If I find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, I can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if I eventually decide to respec into a different build, I can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons.

The most important element of Elden Ring‚Äôs philosophy, though, is the freedom to just walk away and do something else when you hit a wall. Elden Ring is hard ‚Äì which is to be expected from a FromSoft game ‚Äì but its difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. I hit multiple points, even all the way up until the moment when I reached the very last boss, where I‚Äôd unlocked paths to several bosses and simply could not make headway on any of them. But even though I hit dead ends on those paths, there was always somewhere else I could go ‚Äì a region I hadn‚Äôt thoroughly explored, an NPC quest that I had set aside for later, a Light of Grace indicator that I had not yet followed. There was never a point in Elden Ring when I was at a complete loss of what to do, and every time I explored those other regions and followed those alternate paths I would find new gear and items, level up my stats, or learn new spells or skills that would eventually give me the extra edge I needed to power through a boss that had given me problems.

This game has made me mentally insane.

GOTY EASILY
Epic
A true masterpiece! I would put it in my personal top5 of my 30 year long "gaming career". 
Warning: You need time and commitment to truly enjoy this big of a game. The fact that you can go almost anywhere from the start, as well as the lack of a tutorial might scare casual gamers at first but if you overcome that hurdle, you are in for a ride!
all I'm gonna say is , if you like exploring and hard fights buy it, if not this is not the game for you
Take risks and explore
perfect
I mean its alright...
One of the best games i have ever played cant think of anything bad about it just pure perfection highly recomend

One of the greatest games ever made.
Elden Ring is such a great experience im currently around 17 hours in and ive explored so much, but have only discovered a small portion of the massive world. There is so many things to do in this game it is great.

I live, I die, I live again
Holy shmokes
100% this on the xbox. upgraded to PC, puirchased it again and already put 70 hours in haha i am ready for the Erdtree!!
"hidden path ahead" there was no hidden path ahead :(
Poggers
Elden Ring is a few steps forward and a lot more steps backwards. Compared to Dark Souls 3, the highs are higher but there so many more lows, and the lows are much lower. The legacy dungeons such as Stormveil and Leyndell and main boss fights such as Godrick, Godfrey, Radahn, Maliketh, and especially Radagon are Fromsoft's best, and some mechanical additions like jumping help elevate and add another layer to the level and boss design.

While it comes with a world that is undeniably pretty and fun to explore at first, the game has many issues that really inflate in severity as you progress. Once you pass the first two or three areas, the optional content of the world severely degrades in quality. Copy-paste dungeons with limited selections of enemies and duplicate bosses tear a hole through the immersion of the game and can really drag out the runtime.

The combat of the game is not so perfect, either. Many required bosses have problems in their own right, such as the Fire Giant or Godskin Duo being abhorrent to fight due to overtuned design elements that feel engineered to force you to cheese. Furthermore, the balance of the lategame gets absurd. Enemies and bosses will kill you in two or three hits, and while that is fine to happen under certain conditions, "50 VIG with medium/heavy armor" should not be one of them. They massively stretched the standards of what you need to have acceptable tanking to the point where a setup that would make you feel near-invincible in DS3 makes you feel just barely capable in this game.

They really need to stop fucking around
perfect. You can make the game easier or harder not by a slider but by the time you prepare. If you still thinks its too hard summon a friend or two. nearly all builds are viable. You like the deafult axe more than the super duper hyper bos drop? Sure, upgrade it and run with it. the ammount of customisation and builds avainable is astonishing. Turbo gamers can rush through no summons or co-op and make the game harder, while casual players can gang on the bosses and still have a lot of fun.
Of course
just play this g
good enough
Yes
A breath taking open world Souls game with many locations, dungeons, secrets, and bosses to discover and conquer on your way to become Elden Lord!

Combat is tough but fair. Exploration is more important than ever with the jumping mechanic, similar to Sekiro. The new Ashes of War system lets you change almost any weapon's special move with other abilities, allowing you to change your play style with a weapon you prefer.

Classic environmental and lore story telling of Fromsoft by reading item descriptions or interpreting the vague dialogue of the interesting NPCs that you'll meet.

Coop and invasions feel similar and are quite fun. You can still join "Covenants" but they aren't mutually exclusive anymore, meaning you can join all of them and complete their quests. Some are areas and quest might be locked behind story progression so be careful on the timing of completing them.

If you enjoyed any of the previous souls games then you will feel right at home with Elden Ring. I'd say this is more fast paced than Demon Souls or the first two Dark Souls, leaning more toward Bloodborne and Sekiro for timings and speed.

Overall a 10/10 souls game!
Dark Souls amazing depth and gameplay but with a huge open world. Truly a remarkable game that goes above and beyond. Fromsoft Never seems to disappoint. 10/10
Amazing game

VERY GOOD GAME.
pretty good
great game
Hard game. Made it fun when I looked up a map for where all the bosses were and just explored in that direction. Otherwise I was clueless and wasn't fun.
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella
its alr
git gud
this game is good thats all you need to know
Why tf i can't deflect.
-Sekiro player
I played for a few hours, it was fun I guess.
Superb graphics design
Easily the best pure gameplay in From's Souls line up.  The open world is great on the first run, but makes following runs pretty tedious to get going because of all the mindless running around collecting seeds, weapons, talismans and other items.  Build variety (or a randomiser mod) makes that tolerable though, and the gameplay and boss design is on point.

It has some BS because it's a Souls game so of course it does, but it's kept to a minimum.
Maybe the true Elden Ring, was the friends we made along the way.
got gangbanged at some ruins never playing again
is very good
epic. draconic tree sentinel gave me every mental and physical illness known to man.
Greatest Game to Ever Lace Them Up. The Giannis of Video Games, LITERALLY!
Good game, but it has really REALLY bad bosses. late game becomes a chore. far from a masterpiece, dark souls is better
I am not someone who typically plays "souls-like" games, but i found this game to be just awesome. This game is challenging, but it never felt "unfair" or "cheap."  Admittedly there have been points in the the game that were extremely frustrating and felt impossible to beat. There is a great deal of satisfaction that comes from overcoming these challenges. I would not consider myself good at video games, but i have been able to beat all of the major bosses (including Malenia) if you are patient and persistent you will be successful. 

This game offers great build diversity and some very interesting weapons and armor. The Story and lore are incredible and the world building is really impressive (although it is sad and pretty much no one has a happy ending) 

characters/monsters are well designed and nice to look at (even if they are hideous abominations)

combat is both punishing and rewarding. attacking/dodging/moving with intent and strategy will lead you to victory, while arrogantly attacking even the easiest of enemies will be punished if you are careless. 

I highly recommend it. it is certainly an experience that will be a standard for games for years to come.
suffering :D
this game is great if your neighbors don't care about you screaming really racist things
fire giant sucks if you are using a normal build
commander niall is just unfair and i am a skill less smooth ape  the solution to every problem is just get good exept for rychards skull attack that is bad game design

Lot's of bosses, great exploration, good combat, tons of weapons, beautiful art direction and soundtrack... just git gud scrub.
Nice souls game

game has lots of dogs. I say good game.

Hope I can finish in time for the DLC!!
Almost the perfect refinement of all things FROMSOFT. Could use a few more kinds of bosses, and a boss rush mode or a way to revisit old boss fights. Also, some more ways to make stealth gameplay more viable. Otherwise, this game is damn near perfect.
Best game ever made!

If youre a dark souls an its a great game to get into
best berserk game without being a berserk game
What an impossible game to learn from the start. I use a controller on the PC. Some things dont work with controller, like quick weapon changes for left and right hand side. And some things dont work well on keyboard. Just trying to use the different attacks was so cumbersome. I have never had to spend an hour on the initial trainer and still barely be able to change quickly between weapons. Really aweful and I am sorry I wasted $100 on buying this. Way to hard to just play, and I did not even get to a mission.
I love this game, it has good story and challenging bosses/enemies.

this being my first game of its type i have ever played, IT WAS Hard at the start, very..... it is also very time consuming, would recommend if you have time on your hands
Just beat NG+7 before writing this game and just wow. Fucking amazing game and one of the better games of all time.
V good
maybe add challenging difficulty next time
isekai game
I wish i could put mixed. The gameplay is pretty fun but is extremely weighed down by frame rate issues and performance. I have watched multiple videos and they all say the same thing and sure it improves it slightly but its pretty sad that I can't just play a game on my pc at a decent frame rate.
good
i might be going mentally insane :D
The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can‚Äôt predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.
first fromsoft game and will not be the last that i play!
Elden Ring is like any of the previous Souls games...just better. Sure Elden Ring is still as hard as a guy after three viagra and sure the experience might be rough but I can say without a doubt you'll enjoy the ride.

10/10
its darksouls. play for pain.
i love the platforming in this game
super easy game but also very good
h
This game has a lack of feet, but everything else is ok I guess
Brother
The perfect game!!! If its to hard there are many ways to make it easier like coop or just op builds. This game is a 10/10
Elden Ring is my first souls game, and after my friend nagged me to buy it for countless weeks I decided to give it a chance. It took me forever to get into it, taking monthly intervals between playtime. After the third main boss, I was hooked. The gameplay is enjoyable, the graphics are absolutely stunning, and the storyline is great. I believe anyone should check out Elden Ring, even if they feel like they wouldn't like it. I was saying the same thing, it's now sitting in my library 100% achievements. :)
guuuuuugd gayme:]
mmm yes
My most favorite game of all time!
The best game ever created
Like every other AAA game, it feels like everything happens 2.5 seconds after you input anything after movement simulations have been ran through a dozen different physics algorithms and three different state machines programmed by 30 different programming teams none of which were involved in the game design.  I'm sure fans will say "that's part of the organic difficulty", but I remember when games were responsive.
yeah this game is pretty good, i suck at it tho
if you like pain you will like this
incredible game

PRAISE THE BLOODFLAME

Elden Ring is a challenging Souls-game RPG game.

I will preface this review by mentioning I've actually played the game solely using keyboard & mouse, so yes I will definitely mention that the controls and attacks were very wonky at times. The learning curve of the game is very high, the game has so many mechanics, attacks and items to use that it quickly becomes overwhelming. It is a progressive experience where you first learn the basics, then slowly integrate more strategies as time goes on. Thankfully, all you  lose on death are runes, so you can spend your runes on level ups and equipment without being penalised by dying repetitively to an hard enemy or an hard boss.

Elden Ring has a ton of main quests and side quests alike, with a cast of interesting characters and bosses. Everything follows the same theme, but each of them are very unique nonetheless. The monster design of Elden Ring is THE BEST I've ever seen in any games ever, considering I love grim and terrifying-looking creatures. The story is pretty good, but while it is probably an unpopular opinion, I think it could've been better. I felt attached to some of the characters and some parts are very intense, but I did feel detached to the story as a whole for some reason.

My favorite thing about Elden Ring is the everlasting feeling of constant progression whenever you unlock a new site of grace (fast travel waypoints) and after beating major encounters you have to work hard for to learn the mechanics of the bosses. My second favorite thing about Elden Ring is the hundreds of different weapons, armors, spells, incantations and different builds you can come up with.

The graphics are amongst the best of any games I've ever played, the cutscenes are super well made and the background are even more beautiful. Some of the animations while moving are a bit wonky, but the scenery is a breathtaking experience every single times. The spell effects are also top notch and the variety of backgrounds/dungeons/castles/shacks/etc is simply put crazy.

The soundtrack of this game is absolutely amazing, but it's mostly atmospheric or intense. It doesn't really have any memorable songs from what I could tell, but it is a very pleasurable auditory experience.

As far as the controls and overall mechanics of the game, I obviously think that a ton of things are overtuned or wonky. The platforming is very bad in some parts of the game and some bosses really feel like they hit outside of their hitbox. It also happened to me a countless amount of time I swing my weapon an inch too far from the boss and then get punished by almost dying due to missing my hit and trying to recover from it. That made most of the gameplay super frustrating and I definitely loss a ton of time to bosses and certain enemies due to that.

Also, the requirements for this game are quite high. Yes, the graphics are amazing, but my 2070 struggled with a lot of the game on the highest settings. I had only 1 crash thankfully, but I had hundreds of slowdowns when there are big explosions or a lot of smoke or whatever.

As for the expected playtime, it really is honestly almost endless. If you go for different builds, different routes, different choices, collecting everything and going up to NG+7 (or higher), you will have a few hundreds of hours in this game easily.

Overall, if you are willing to put a ton of efforts into learning a deep, complex and hard game, it is worth and it is worth the full price. Just keep in mind it is a really hard game and unless you use summons and the best setups, you will need a lot of practice to beat the first few bosses and even more to beat the harder bosses.
GOOD GAME!
There are so many dogs! So many to pet and love! Definitely the best farming simulator I have ever played!
One of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. Gameplay is top notch. The world is deep, layered, and filled with lore. I absolutely love this game.
this game is low key fire get it or you are a goober
It's good
already finished game on ps5 multiple times. pc stutters a bit but 10/10
obvious why it won game of the year
Shitty unbalanced game, too difficult, 644 hours in and I'm still stuck on 'Rick, God of Soldiers' or whatever his name is. 7.8/10 Too much water.

Game hard, game good
When I started fromsoft games with DS3 I played a lot of open worlds and really wanted to see what they wold be capable of doing in this genre and had big expectations when the game was announced, but I gota say that this simply blew my mind and went way over what I had been dreaming for years
If Kai Cenant can beat Elden ring then so can you. If you can‚Äôt then you‚Äôre forever maidenless.
really picks up after ~200 deaths
One of the greatest fantasy open worlds with so much content and amazing variety. To me it may not be Fromsofts best but they certainly made a title worthy of game of the year in 2022 and lets all hope the DLC can make this even better
best game ever
This is my first FromSoftware game and honestly I am surprised at how addictive I found it. Played once for 100 hours (didn't finish) and came back a year later for a new save file and am still having a blast at it.
If you think you can find a better open world souls game than this, you should lay these foolish ambitions to rest...
the first type of game like this and ill always love it
W game no complaints
11/10 prob gets better
Game of the Decade !!

The greatest game of all time
Masterpiece. This game is so good you should wait full price.
the best game 4ever
Wel one of the best games there is on the market
On my 2nd and 3rd play through (simultaneous, one on ng+ and one with my brother), and I'm still finding some new things. What keeps me coming back to this game is the sheer quantity of quality content in the form of boss fights, unique weapons and skills, and small areas that I find despite thinking I've done nearly everything.
After my first play through last year, I did my best to understand the lore hidden in the Lands between and I'm amazed at the depth this game offers. Miyazaki does not miss, this game is a masterpiece.
Yes....
beautiful

after 150 hours in the game i still find new stuff/ have lots of stuff i want to try out , endless replayability,great combat and great bosses. BUY IT!
it's okay
I put this game down when it first came out. Can't recall why I did not get into the first time. Started watching others play and loved the game, but still didn't play it until the announcement of the DLC. Which gave me the incentive to play through the game and it has been a joy. I'm only 30+ hours in (rookie numbers), but it has been a fun experience running around and exploring the world of Elden Ring.
Epic Battles and Engaging Gameplay

The battles in Elden Ring are nothing short of epic. Every encounter feels significant, supported by impressive animations and a high level of difficulty. The difficulty is just right to enhance the feeling of reward after mastering a tough opponent. This sense of achievement is one of the main reasons why Elden Ring is so captivating.

Extensive Playtime and Exciting Exploration

Another highlight is the sheer length of the game. The world of Elden Ring offers countless hours of exploration, where new armors, weapons, abilities, and spells can be discovered. Every corner of the world is beautifully designed, inviting you to linger and marvel.

Performance Issues and Frustrations

Unfortunately, the gaming experience is marred by significant performance issues on the PC. To utilize my system‚Äôs maximum graphical performance and achieve a smooth image, I was forced to use a community program that bypasses the 60 FPS lock. This solution worked well as long as I played offline since the program does not harmonize with the Easy Anti-Cheat system and would lead to a ban if used online.

It is disappointing that the developers do not want to implement basic performance matters such as the FPS unlock themselves. Playing online was a frustrating experience with constant screen tearing and an unstable 60 FPS lock that even my RTX 3080 could not consistently maintain. This is particularly annoying since there is no cross-play, making it unnecessary to artificially limit PC players.

Pricing Policy and DLC Strategy

The developers' decision to release a DLC for a hefty ‚Ç¨40 without addressing the easily fixable flaws of the main game is hard to accept. The main game still costs ‚Ç¨60 even two years after release, which seems outrageous given the existing issues. It is understandable that fans of FromSoftware have high expectations, but in many aspects, Elden Ring feels overhyped.

Conclusion

Elden Ring has the potential to be a masterpiece but is held back by severe performance issues and a questionable pricing policy. The epic battles, engaging gameplay, and beautifully designed world cannot fully offset these flaws. FromSoftware should be ashamed of not addressing such basic performance problems while still charging high prices for the main game and the DLC. The game is definitely overrated.
:)

Probably the best game ive played
good fucking game well done
litty
put a ring on it
its hard and thats what makes it fun also the dlc is coming soon so that is about a extra 60 or 65 hours you can add to this game but if you dont want to spend cash on a dlc dont worry this game has a ton of mods that make your game funny and harder also you can play coop properly if you mod the game so thats a plus
i am in love with malenia
Decent
Holy shit this game so fucking hard its make my cock throb from all the dying i genuinely losing my mind. Its a fun game the only problem is waiting for the dlc. WAITING FOR THAT SHIT IS LIKE NO NUT NOVEMBER MAN. Highly not recommended to others because it gives your virginity back so prepare to be a virgin cause miyazaki is not taking any prisoners.
took me a long time to come around but i get it now. dis fun
Just No-hitted Malenia, I'm just better
Good game, very scary, very rewarding, lots of fun.
decent
easy foe's await
My first Souls Game but made me fall in love with the series. Have played through multiple times between Steam and PS5, there is great replay value. If you are up for the challenge would definitely recommend to anyone. Beautiful game.

How this sh1t won GOTY?
Screen tearing (if you want to play with freesync or GSYNC, you need to turn off HDR, LMAO and tearing is f4cking unplayable with HDR on), performance issues on high end system, outdated graphics, bugs like mobs attacking you through the wall. They never fixed all this problems, just added useless ray-tracing and now created DLC on this sh1tty engine with fps cap on 60 LMAO, are we in 2010? What a joke. 
The game positions itself like a hard to complete game, but it‚Äôs easy and even DS3 looks harder game compared to this arcade sh1t. May be it is ok game, but not GOTY with all those problems, learn already how to fix the game, Fromsoftbottom. 
Sometimes, people like to overhype some shitty games for nothing, thats crazy. Yeah and for all this problems in AAA you pay 60‚Ç¨

Paid ¬£50 to be called maidenless. 10/10 would buy again.
I am not a Souls-like fan traditionally, and I've played most if not all of them, or at least tried to. Elden Ring however really hooked me and I actually beat the entire thing and have pre-ordered the DLC. The open world aspect of this game allows for grinding for a baby gamer like me, to help the game be a bit more forgiving. Combine that with the ability to use summons to aid you in battle, and you have a recipe for how I loved this game.
good game
I was a big hater of this game until I tried it a few months back. Once you get into the game it gets really good. Changed my life.

best game to ever exist crafted by the hands of god himself
cool gaem
I cannot believe I never picked up the Souls games before. Easily a 10/10
The culmination of every King's Field and Dark Souls games... and the lore is still CRYPTIC AF!
Holy cumnshit. This game got me into DS3, then DS1. I'm a total from-head now. Anyways.

HIGHLY recommend this game if you like the medieval RPG-ness of Skyrim, but you want more "real" feeling combat. The combat in these games (Elven Ring, Dark Souls, other games in the series and genre "soulslikes") is SOOO good. It is tough but fair, in that, you know you were impatient/sloppy, and that's why you died. You will die A LOT. It will be FRUSTRATING. Definite controller-thrower, but do not rage. This game has actually helped some of my anger issues.

It just feels so real. The item scarcity, the combat, the way the game DOESN'T tell you EVERY single thing, or put a quest marker on a overlay compass. You just play the damn game, no one knows wtf is going on, and you keep picking up these worthless items "consume 10,000 ruin tomato for a 5 second boost in stamina" that's an exaggeration, but holy shit. This game. Everything you'd hate about this game, you love it. It's GOOD because it's HARD.

This game is huge. You will not fully explore this game even after 200 hours (I didn't). It's also BEAUTIFUL in a gloomy kind of way.

Biggest thing I wanna say is I don't even feel interested in playing skyrim or hardly any other games now. Seriously these games are that good.

Try not to die.

its good

good shit
at the time of writing it seems to work really well on linux using Proton Beta. Also the progression I had on my windows machine seamlessly transferred over just by installing it, meaning I didn't have to start over from scratch which is a huge plus.
I finished Elden Right for the first time on my PS5. This game is something that I thought that I will never experience in gaming. World in this game is HUUUUUUUUUUGE, you can spend 150-200 hours in it and still most probably you will not see everything. Combat pacing is similar to Dark Souls III, it is quick and responsive. Level design is on a level I have never seen in any other game. Progression feels great. You see and feel your character getting stronger with every hour played.

This game is almost perfect. But it has few problems:
- No normal coop. Really FromSoftware? Huge world in which you can spend even 200 hours but no normal coop? Thankfully that was fixed with a mod which you can download online
- if you miss some optional area in the beginning of the game and you will find it later, then you will simply steamroll through all enemies and bosses in this area. It is good to be powerful, but not THAT powerful.
- No normal cities or normal quests. I understand this approach in other games like DS1/2/3. But here it simply doesn't fit the world. Is it really so hard to introduce quest log describing the ongoing quests? Why all lore and quests have to be hidden behind this "Dark Souls" mistery curtain?
its alright
l

Great game. FROM Level Design to the small details in weapons and enemies.

This game is awesome

its fun but hard

One of the greatest games to be released in recent times. This was the first souls-like game I ever played, and I couldn't put it down even after 13-hour work shifts. Truly addicting and incredibly rewarding gameplay. Amazing story, huge build variation, and unique enemies and bosses. This game provides everything you can want and expect from a AAA experience. If these types of games interest you, this is where you should start!
Very challenging, but for someone like myself who has never played a FromSoft game, this is truly a wonderful experience. Highly recommend as long as you don't mind tough fights (though I think that it's rewarding at the end).

Game is goated with the sauce. I write this review with my deepest heartfelt apologies to Seb and Nicketh. Please forgive me for my blatant ignorance and stupidity in avoiding Elden Ring until now - sorry just isn't enough. I now understand that my decision to sleep on this game is one of the worst disasters that I could have ever achieved in my life.
i have played alot of bad games but this really tops it this was an awful time playing please do not buy dont get how it won game of the year
good times ahead

Amazing graphics

overall a really good game I just dont like maliketh or milenia bc they both are bs bosses that can insta kill you no matter how high your health is. You can make this game easy by summoning even if I chose not to but play how you want and dont let the playerbase trick you into thinking its cheating or you're a worse player cuz of it, although yes you're taking the easy way out you could always come back and do it without summons next time.

9/10
10/10 game just play it
amazing game, tones of different endings with great story lines, and amazinggggg artwork.
Probably the only open world game I've actually enjoyed playing. The game is full of content and interesting things to find and explore.
Combat seems more forgiving and refined compared to previous games by Fromsoft. The storytelling method Fromsoft uses is still incredible and engaging, plus the game allows you to play in whatever way you want to play.
Also, play Seamless coop mod if you want to play with friends, and/or Convergance if you want more content after you finish the game.
GOog
Not done, but so far, so good. Offers lots of freedom for the most part, and many things are left unexplained, and is left to the player to figure out. It's pretty neat if you got the time to invest, and there's a true feeling of growing your character incrementally over the course of the game (rather than having power spikes at certain levels).

However, that's not to say the game doesn't piss you off every now and then. Some scenarios are made to throw you off, usually leading to near instant death without prior knowledge. Some cases are just painful/tedious, like having to walk across half a cave just to make a 2nd attempt to fight a boss.
Peak gaming
Foul tarnished, in search of the Elden Ring.

one of the best games ive played
FINALLY, MY SUFFERING IS ALREADY END!!!!

SMOKING MALENIA..
really good game and really recomend this game if you are a big souls fan and really fun with friends.
Made me cry and also break my wall down all in one
   I want to start off by saying I absolutely hate souls like games/combat, and the first 10 hours of this game was a slog for the type of games i usually play, however once i finally immersed myself and figured out the gameplay loop, i went from HATING this game, to putting it in my top 5 single player experiences. The world building is great and if you are a lore buff there is SO MUCH here for you. if you are a gameplay buff once you realize the gameplay loop and how things are acquired and how you are rewarded for beating areas/bosses or finding secrets you will see the genius in the game design.

   To summarize if these types of games aren't for you, I recommend giving it a real honest shot i don't think you will be disappointed It got Game of the Year for a reason. From hating it - to my top 5, take it from me this game is a very rich and rewarding experience.

Now I'm just waiting on Brandon Sanderson to world build for a game like this!

Good game, I've been enjoying it a lot. It's not a 10/10 it definitely can be better if certain things can be tweaked.

One thing I hated is not able to view the map while in combat, I understand you don't want people teleporting but in dungeons you can view your map but you can't teleport away, can't we just have the same thing while in combat ?
Makes me want to split open my skull but i get cool armor so its ok
this game is terrible i beat it 10 times to make sure trust me
would get scarlet rot to smash Malenia

This game is one of a kind. So many things have been said about it. 
To me, it gave me freedom that other games never did, and for that I am grateful.
It changed my perspective in a lot of things; and I began to look at games in a different way.

I will always recommend it. 10/10 For the thrill, the adrenaline, the danger, the defeat. the frustration. It all came together as a triumph of life.
This is the best and worst game ever created.
big boi elden mans
the best game to exist
good game
What a game. I'm so glad I finally got around to playing it. Amazing combat, really fun magic, great world design. It's just fantastic.
Dont get me wrong the game is and can be fun. The bosses are extremely hard and unbalanced especially early game. As well as them giving you little to no rewards maybe a sword and 15k cash and if its a main boss a rune thingy you cant use unless you find or buy the casters for them. On top of it all when you finally kill something its not a sense of accomplishment but rather a feel of thank god thats over.

best game ever
ill review this masterpiece whenever im not busy playing it
Elden Peak
One of my favorite games second only to Bloodborne. I play this game if I can't play Bloodborne, or if I'm just bored. Sometimes it angers me, but I always run back to it.
Overall a very good edition to the souls-like genre, sure sometimes bosses tend to spam a single attack but it's not that big of a deal most of the time (except for elden beast that pu$$y  just kept swimming away and won't let me unga bunga him) but besides that very fun would recommend
literally the best game ever made. i can't reiterate just buy it (or pirate it then buy it when you have money)
very good game!
nearly flawless game

This game is so hard

O melhor game j√° que toquei nos √∫ltimos 5 anos.
still trying to beat the soldier of godrick
TOP 10
hardest game i've ever played [first souls game]
64 hours and counting, still maidenless.
ez pz üçã sqeze
I'm not a fan of how the world opens up. The constant fighting makes it less believable, and the lack of a difficulty setting doesn't help. Losing all money upon death, which is essential for advancement (except for upgrading potions), is frustrating. The lack of direction at any point makes me not want to explore the world, and ultimately, not play the game.
good

best game of the all time

brilliant

AWFUL QUEST SYSTEM and stupid autosaves ruining my playthroughs. unplayable without a 100% walkthrough and without backup saves every 5 minutes
Malenia is gay please install some jet mods and u will have 10x better time than normal O_O
this is the greatest game of all time
Elden Ring is a near-perfect game, thanks to the brilliant collaboration between George R. R. Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki. The story and setting are rich and immersive, pulling players into a dark, mysterious world.

The game's breathtaking scenery is a standout feature. Each region is unique and meticulously crafted, making exploration visually captivating. The art direction and environmental design are top-notch, ensuring that every corner of the game world is a pleasure to discover.

Gameplay strikes a perfect balance between challenge and engagement. Combat is precise and demanding, requiring skill and strategy. This level of difficulty is fair and immensely satisfying, giving a true sense of accomplishment with every victory. The variety of weapons, spells, and character builds adds depth and replayability.

The story is a masterful blend of Martin's intricate narrative style and Miyazaki's cryptic storytelling. Lore is conveyed through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, and character interactions, encouraging players to piece together the narrative themselves.

With the upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, excitement is building within the community. The prospect of new content and challenges is tantalizing, promising to expand on the already rich world of Elden Ring.

In conclusion, Elden Ring offers a captivating world, challenging gameplay, and a compelling story. It's a must-play for any action RPG fan, and I can't wait for the release of Shadow of the Erdtree.
Many word is to much,pair of words is not enough,one word PERFECT
Â•ΩÊ∏∏ÊàèÔºåÁé©
One of the best games i've ever played.  Completely changed my mind about RPG's, gonna check out more asap.
fuck you phoenix

peak
very very good and pleasing game

ygiuo
this game will make u want too slither ur way up a shaft
What a godly game! Maidens everywhere
I AM ADDICTED HELP
Awesome game
No word
I‚Äôm a 45-year-old father, probably one of the oldest gamers trying to keep up with these whippersnappers. I‚Äôm a single dad to my 14-year-old son, who‚Äôs a certified master of avoiding quality time with his old man. For Christmas in 2021, his uncle gifted him this game, so naturally, it got installed faster than a dad joke can be told. By the end of the week, he had racked up 24 hours of gameplay, which was about as horrifying as discovering the internet history of a teenager.

Desperate to reconnect, I decided to dive into this digital abyss and made myself a Steam account. I figured, if you can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, join ‚Äòem, right? I loaded up the game, picked a character that looked suspiciously like a pixelated potato, and started wandering aimlessly in this strange new world. It felt like being the new kid in high school all over again, minus the braces and awkward dance moves.

Completely lost, I turned to my son for help. He hosted a game, and I joined, praying I wouldn't embarrass myself too much. Surprisingly, it was a blast! We bonded over slaying virtual monsters, which is way more fun than discussing algebra homework. It turned out to be the best time I‚Äôd had with my son since my wife passed away, and not just because it didn't involve any more awkward attempts at 'dad and son' small talk.

This game has since become our secret weapon for family bonding. We‚Äôve forged an alliance stronger than any superhero team, and even managed to drag our adventures out into the real world. Now, we spend more time together outside the house too‚Äîthough I still can‚Äôt get him to stop watching YouTube videos of other people playing the same game.

In the end, this game reminded me that there‚Äôs fun to be had in everything, even if it involves getting schooled by a teenager. It‚Äôs brought us closer and given us a treasure trove of ridiculous, happy memories. Who knew digital dungeons could lead to real-life family treasures?
without a doubt a must play for anyone that enjoys a good games, I haven't got the words to make this game justice, pick it up and play it
It is a very satisfying game.
I LOVE THIS GAME
yup
it is hard game
but fun 
still fugureing out on how to know what "build" fits my play style
this game sucks only because im bad at it
Everything I wish Jedi Survivor was (it doesn't lag)
üëπ
Nah, I'd win
absolutely
I hugged someone and got a weird ending at 69 hours, 10/10 would hug again.
elden ring? more like empty ring
too long
Michael Zaki cooked with this one
You know what you're getting, most accessible souls game so far, hurts you really good, makes you want to cry but in a really rewarding way
d
I love how this game reminds me of my childhood, abusive and unending. Good times.
makes me mad but its a damn good game. broke a couple controllers though
And now im maidenless. 10/10
good game
little guidense and overley complicated but hey i get to hit big monsters

i played this game for an two hours. wanted a refund bad. then i was like, probs wont get the refund anyways cause over 2 hours playtime. so i started playing again, and this is peak. so fun and addictive now that ive gotten used to some of the mechanics. i cant wait to progress and die more. worth it ngl. its just fun.
First off, I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS GAME (proven with my play time). With that said, i cannot recommend right now. I know its been about two years since the game released and its still hindered with frame rate bug. After 2 mins I log in the game, the framerate dips and kicks me out EVERY TIME. I cant even play with my friends because it keeps kicking me out of the game and by the time the framerate reaches 60fps, I have to reset the game and the cycle repeats. I really do enjoy this game but the bugs currently is hindering my experience. I've tried everything that's been recommended online but nothing works and I dont want to disable e-cores or use any mods.
(If this does get fixed soon or gets fixed when the DLC comes out, then I'll change my review)

p.s
here is my computer build specs
Processor	AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16-Core Processor             4.20 GHz
Installed RAM	64.0 GB (63.1 GB usable)
Graphics Card  Geforce RTX 4090

I really shouldn't be having problems -_-


fun
Really enjoying the game so far, played around 40 hours
i recomend this game to everyone seeking a challange and is ready to rage quit. I wish i had the money to buy this piece of art and i would like to apologize to all the people that payed for the DLC
ok
one of the best games ive ever played!
eyes gouged 10/10
I was misled to believe that ER is a mysterious story-boss fightsfull narrative only to find a dead open map with no UI guidance/ no quest marker/ no indication nor anything implying that there is a story. Lore from out of game sources is NOT a good story-telling. Am glad I have never touched any prior souls games. Boss Fighting IS a bad thing to base an entire game on, esspecially when you dont even give any background story by text ingame behind each boss......Fk this. No youtube video mentioned anything useful or a warning that it has no story, only the usual "hurrrr y'know like Dark Souls hurrrr fighting bosses aimlessly is fun hurrrr"

Not fun, glad I paid less than its listed price. I am unfortunate that I bought it from a 3rd party store for a lower price.
absolute abomination of mechanics, delayed attacks, my character basically reacted after 200 years of me pressing the button
good
very cool
Great open world game. some dungeons get repatative but other than that great experience. Story is worth persuing as well as quests scattered around the world.

Best game of all time
Outstanding.
shiii is bussin bussin
One of my favorite games in the past 10 years
peak
Quite literally the best video game oat.
best game
This game is fire, I didn't think it at first but that was because I was bad at the game but now that I am better at it, this game is absolutely amazing.
Great game to explore on your own and even better to join a friend. There's a lot of weak players end game that camp the starting zones with powerful items, so heads up if you try to join a friend in the starter zones.
good
You will get your ass kicked, and love it.

This is my first Fromsomft game and I couldnt be happier giving it a try.

XbleepX Melenia though.
If you haven't you really need to play this game
With the amount of time I've put into the game, Its been more than worth the money.
Best Rom-Com ever
who up elden they ring
gg
Best game ever
You don't have the right, O you don't have the right.
Therefore, you don't have the right, O you don't have the right.
waow
Dog ahead.
‚öîÔ∏è
Makes me want to kill myself. 10/10 game.
If you used Mimic Tear you didn't beat the game.
Been 2 year and QoL still shit.

All vessels are destined to one day break.
Bought again on Steam after playing on the PS5, the revenge tour was worth it.
this game is HUGE and a nice challenge

GOTY
It took me a long time to really get into this game. For me Limgrave was just a huge empty field with a lot of concealed caves and other areas holding upgrades and resources to help advance the game. When I first started playing that's not really the kind of experience I wanted and it hurt my initial impressions.

After finally getting a helping hand from a friend and a jumpstart on my progression, I was able to tear through the rest of the game and almost finish two more NG+ cycles.

I love this game, but it almost has inverse Dark Souls 1 syndrome for me. Elden Ring's open world is almost a hindrance to me because the opening areas largely feel like padding that were designed but not really developed into interesting zones. While I've seen a lot of claims that the game consistently gives you a lot of options for places to explore and enemies to go fight against if you're stuck, I didn't start really feeling this until I was well into the Altus Plateau, which is nearly halfway through the game.

Limgrave is largely populated by world bosses that you're going to see repeatedly like dragons and Tibia Mariners and Night's Cavalry. The same is true for Caelid except that almost half of Caelid is more-or-less endgame and will likely get you killed if you wander in too early. Between the two, there are maybe three legacy dungeons, and only one of them has an end boss which is both unique and actually advances the game in a meaningful way. Everything is just so many open fields with tons of generic enemies which drop neither significant amounts of runes nor upgrade materials.

Meanwhile when you get to the Capital Outskirts, the critical path becomes a lot more apparent and the areas begin to feel more like traditional Soulslike levels with shortcuts and branching paths and other things that flow rather than just sprawl out in all directions.

If you're like me and are don't really care for the open world aspect and the need to constantly bump your face into walls to find advancement for your character build, I highly advise having the wiki open on a second monitor while you play. Doing so for me helped me develop concrete goals and locations to visit and explore for things I wanted rather than just wandering the world aimlessly looking for interesting things to interact with.
good
Put these foolish ambitions to rest
If you don't find this fun js git gud

why cant i romance dung eater
Cosmic horror wrapped in a facade of high fantasy.  You will die.  Probably a lot.
Bro I just want to get to the gameplay rather than running around an empty world full of copy-paste dungeons, gets repetitive real quick. Game looks great but it's a glorified walking (horse riding) simulator.
best game ive ever played in my entire life
Very fun
Very good
HUGE OPEN WORLD GAME.. DIFFICULT BUT REALLY SUPERB
amazing
very good
I never got into the Souls games, but I really really enjoy this one. It has ZERO hand-holding which I love and the boss fights are intense and rewarding to beat. The game seems a bit cluncy on mouse and keyboard so I would recomment a gamepad for this.

Only downside is that they enforce 60fps limit which is silly. But you can get around that using mods.
greatest game ever created
Masterpiece of a game, the story and gameplay are just amazing. The game also looks incredible, fromsoft really knocked it out of the park in that way. I only have one complaint with the game and thats the multiplayer, coop is clunky and the system needs to be reworked in the next title. Also sadly due to the changes to invasions its a lot less fun for both sides. Capping the player count to 4 while also only having invasions on coop players just leads to a ton of problems
Fantastic game
I Unga, therefor, i Bunga
Maybe the best game I've ever played
thing wont load pass the log in screen. its been a bug since 2022 come on fromsoftware...
Truly amazing adventure experience!! I never tried any soul games before since not prefer any death of my avatar. However there are many choice in this game: generally avoiding a hard battle, getting stronger and coming back to the fight. Moreover it is so fun figuring out the secret of this world. What happend before we come??
Insane
i whack them with my fingor
gud
mohglester
Best game of all time.
goated game
cant fuck melania.
If you haven't played these before there is a 'hump' I found I had to get over before I enjoyed it.  That said, once I made it past that point in the game I became obsessed!
sheeeshhhh easyyyy radagon
497.0 hrs on record Id say I love the game and then some. No other game rivals it, looking forward to the DLC
epiccc

good gam
masterpiece
GOATED GAME
Behold, Peak!
since no one will ever read my comment, I am gay.
just finished the tutorial, game of the decade.
the best game
one of the best games i ever played, insane graphics and the size of the game huuuuuh its big
crazy how its just the best game of all time
Incredible
beautiful graphics, and difficult but fun game play.
too hard chat

Elden Ring is the single greatest gaming experience of my life.  I had only touched a single souls game when I was 11 and only once and properly got my ass beat (BloodBorne).  However this experience as an adult really changed my life.  The game is incredible a massive sprawling open world with so many secrets, amazing armors, cool weapons, cooler bosses, fun npcs, challenging fights where it really feels like your overcoming a massive obstacle.  In conclusion elden ring is incredible I love every boss and im so glad i played it.  Amazing game 10/10 cant wait for shadow of the erd tree!!
yippie
It's a masterpiece!

Only problem is that because the game is so massive it is easy to crash and hard to find the issue.
gud
I laughed. I cried with rage. I cursed Malenia Blade of Miquella two thousand times.

I'm not a Souls fan, but I'll be damned if this game isn't a total masterpiece. From the first moment the Tree Sentinel stomped my ass in the starting area, to the absolute triumph of downing the aforementioned Malenia, [i]Elden Ring[/i] is an unforgettable open world experience that rewards exploration and risk while making you scared for your life at unexpected moments.

Months after I finished playing this game I don't remember a single detail about the convoluted story, but I remember very clearly the mood and tone of the world: dangerous, mad, unpredictable, beautiful. [i]Elden Ring[/i] doesn't hold you by the hand, which makes its early hours a challenge; but on the flipside, the sense of accomplishment you'll get from downing its challenging, sometimes aggravating boss will stay with you for a long, long time.
It's alright I guess 
(Just played the greatest story of my life. It's obvious why this won Game of The Year, not belittling the giant that is God of War Ragnarok.)
This game made me Maidenless IRL
by far hardest game ive played yet the most fun game i have ever played. highly recommend playing
good
it was alright
If you enjoy Dark Souls, self harm, insanity, and dopamine this should be a good fit for you.
Huge world which is very hard but very fun to explore. note that the quest that you go thru has no way point. you have to find it on your own.
Literally fixed every issue I have with DS3, absolute masterpiece of a game.
Fia. That's it
seek lord
super fun
I just don't like interacting with this game. Once again, Fromsoft is competing to have the absolute worst PC experience imaginable.  Game is unplayable on mouse and keyboard. You can't even bind your quick-item slots to an individual key. It has to be a key combination because on controller it's also a key combination. "Just use a controller" is a pretty pathetic thing to have to say. Action rpgs on mouse and keyboard are not a new concept.

Also.. Frame rate locked to 60? in 2024? There is a third party fix, but the game's anti cheat will flag it, so you can't even unlock the framerate unless you want to play a neutered offline experience. Wonderful.

I'm obviously in the minority, but this game manages to piss me off every time I try to play it. It's absolutely unacceptable that a company with this scale is still somehow this bad at making a PC port of their own game. Unacceptable. Would like to play it but fundamental control issues make it a hard pass for me.
Yes
Just yes
Good game Garrett cobb fuck godskin duo!!
Greatest game ever made
Some of the worst hitboxes I have ever seen, its an ongoing FromSoft problem
it's ok I guess
rubbish game

Love this shit. Though I still prolly prefer DS1 slightly.
The Age of the Stars is all I needed
Probably the best game I've ever played.
Screenshot Simulator
perseverance & never giving up when you‚Äôre knocked down, just like life (-: ‚ô°
One of the best games ever made.
Not here to make a lengthy review, but I felt I needed to make A review in some form because god damn this game is something. It is massive, truly endless shit to do, EXTREMELY difficult for majority of the game, if not nearly all of it. I hated it for a good portion of my playthrough, not only for the difficulty, but because I felt the stats and attribute details were WAY too complex for me to grasp, therefore my build may have been somewhat tainted. Finally, after several tens of hours, and getting to areas that I can get good runes grinding from, I can say I am having a shitload of fun playing this game. It is truly a masterpiece, and the cutscenes and lore are INSANE.  I will say, though, prior to getting to good grinding spots, the game felt unnecessarily difficult to level up. That is my main gripe. Other than that and some wonky hitboxes, I will respectfully give this game an 8.8/10
Elden your ring NOW
I had a lot of fun with Elden Ring.

The immensely large world keeps on delivering and surprising you till the very end.

It is not a forgiving game, and it does not hold your hand, but it does make things like items and their associated quests a bit more obvious as NPC's aren't all completely insane.

I'm excited to play the upcoming DLC so much I've taken a week off work.
amazing
straight gas
prepare to get your cheeks clapped, foul tarnished
very beginner friendly
Elden Ring would flip the gaming world upside down if it was real
Eels and Escalators ain't got nothing on this game I tell ya
get good
Playing this game got me maidens
best game i ever player waiting for that dlc tho
DLC Hyyyppeeee !!! This game is Fire!!
mythical type game
Even after a second full playthrough, it still is an insane soulslike. 
S teir game
its like the olympics cuz theres rings but its more like the army simulator game squad 1944 (formerly post scriptum) cuz theire's guns
ye
Great game, it costs an arm and a leg but I have no self preservation so yeah
Goat
Best game of all time.
Great open world game with endless amount of things to do. Easily top 5 games I've ever played. PC port could use some work though...
Not for the faint of heart.
10/10 worth every penny

top5 game
Pain.
amazing
died
If you're like me and have dabbled in the Souls games and knew Elden Ring would be good but weren't sure if it's for you, I have this to offer: It's basically adult Breath of the Wild
SPOILER FREE:
This game made me lose my mind at times but I loved it. I loved walking up to enemies and being knocked off the face of the earth just to get back up and shoot them with a beam of magic straight outta Dragon Ball Z. The bosses were nice and well thought of and the movesets truly made me want to rip out my jugular.
I modded it with co-op so I quite enjoyed hearing the audible pain within my discord voice chat as I was being yelled at for my blood build. Not only that, seeing and hearing my friends jump off cliffs and get their butts handed to em' was awesome. I came from xbox to PC and not much has changed. 
From player to player I reccomend using the "Cranial Vessel Candlestand." the ash of war is highly situational but being able to slap my homie with a burning candle made this weapon peak of entertainment.
Anyway, I gotta go try and beat destined death so hears my positive review
Best Game Of All Time
Terrible Game 10/10
may chaos take the world
holy shit this game is good
This game is nothing but a masterpiece, ive only had about 20 hours in the game so far, and i can say that i have never experienced, and enjoyed a  game like this. If your wondering of trying it out, I highly suggest you do so, and i very well hope you enjoy Elden Ring as much as i did.
it was ez ngl totally didn't go bald and break a controller.... nor did it take me 113 hours to 100% this game ez fr
very nice could be a little more detailed in the story line / quest line department
ended the edging steak
Amazing experience, this game is a blind buy with no catch
I am not one to write reviews but this game is beyond gorgeous and every minute that I play it I am enjoying myself and I am eager to keep exploring. Anyways play it and get gud.
hehehe funny number
why dose the fat white man have a tail?
good game
GOTY for a reason
nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare
I would recommend good game, but now stuck on logging into game server screen so if anyone knows the fix that would be great
i hvae around 200 hr on the game rn its just so beautifull
I have bought this game on like three separate platforms, and each time it has sucked me in and consumed me completely. Elden Ring is objectively the best game I have ever played and it's easily a contender for my favourite game of all time alongside Like a Dragon Gaiden. Genuinely a must play.
SO much love
the best game i ever play
game ahead
peak
ok
Couldn't tell ya why I decided to wait 2 years from launch to start playing but incredible so far
maidenless
No ultra wide support in 2024. Returned instantly. Fix it then I'll play
Just 100% Elden Ring, It is a masterpiece, for my first souls game I had a blast and this game is the starting point of my new journeys from FromSoftware. This is my new favorite game, highly recommend.
"arise now, ye tarnished... ye dead, who yet live"
Perfect introduction to the souls genre. but still pretty easy (so far...).
g
fun and hard
behold
Malenia is hot
GOATED
bery goob. wood play agen. 420/69
Honestlyu,.this game is the goat like if it were SkyJay from Smash Ultimate, he the goat like the game
no other games compare now
This is my favorite game of all time. Playing it again for the fourth time and it never gets boring to me. I will play it all the way up to the starting area of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Can't wait for June 21st.
This thing took over my life.
Very good challenging game good for first time souls like experience
Forget game of the year, this is game of the decade.
Best single player experience I've ever had in any game. It's a must play for anyone seeking challenging combats, stunning visuals and in depth lore. 10/10 masterpiece.
VERY COOL
Unreal game. Great story line, challenging, and addictive
its very immersive
fries, garnished.
I love this game
DLC coming soon and i still haven't finished the game once. 

The game is AMAZING i just suck
This game slaps
R wing
fantastic game that allowed me to finally fix my marriage and my relationship with my parents. fantastic combat with a story that'll resurrect your grandmother just so she can experience the genius of it's writing, like the fact the "Margit" and "Morgott" are actually the same person. However you can't break your fall with your horses' double jump, because of woke.
WORST GAME TO EVER EXIST!

get it 10/10
gas
gh
I'm still stuck on Soldier of Godrick. Someone please help
a
Tough game but fair.
Worth playing.
10/10
melina could GET IT.

edlen ringn
near to a perfect game if not perfect 10/10 would 100% recommend
I love fighting tree sentinel 17 times! the fight gets more and more enjoyable each and every time i fight a new one! 11/10 masterpiece
makes me wanna kms but decent tbf
EEpy
game good story better
Another masterpiece in a long line. From Soft cooked again, as always. PLAY IT! BECOME ELDEN LORD!
Lots of content, best souls game by far no debate needed.
lotta content
Why does everything 1 shot me?
If you like epic boss fights play this godly game
Maybe suffering is not that bad
Love the open world approach to a souls game.  There's a lot of creative freedom allowed, and the game doesn't punish you like normal if an area is too hard.  Just go somewhere else, which might even be harder!  but this is a souls game after all. :)
i wore a pot on my head
I hate my life :)
big sword i am happy
Great story, unreal graphics, cool gameplay, just wish there were more blood dex weapons
<3
Miyazaki the GOAT
sword game
Get gud
porbably the best game ive ever played, loads of replayability and great art direction. may look boring at first but one of the best games ever imo
This game changed my perspective on life...
This game made me marry a rebelling woman, get stabbed by women, fall in love with a women who is married to a man who is also her, kill them and then get attacked by a pokemon. 10/10 experience, would play again
üî´ü¶û
easy  game
easy ngl
Couldn't make it past the tutorial
Sekiro betta
Good game ahead, also pain.
Try dying.
This game is great, has cool enemies, end even great graphics, but dont let that distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines. And on top of that he just came into Harry's and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust.

Best game ever
Malenia is Hot
Simping for Ranni, Melina or Miyazaki?
Its amazing
nawet nie taka trudna
amazing soulslike and soulsborne, doesnt deserve the hate from other soulsbornes
10/10 gameplay and graphics (my opinion ofc)
Best Game Of All Time !
My favourite game of all time. I was never able to finish a single player game since I was cursed with league of legends, but this game healed me, I haven't even touched league in these weeks it's a miracle! Nice not intrusive story (I hate cut scenes) and filled with action getting me that good dopamine, insane graphics and world development, 10/10. Now the only logical thing is to play all the Souls games.
goated ass game
yuh uh
great game
First souls-like I finished. I need to get around to doing the other endings and see the rest of the content as I felt like I may have missed quite a bit in my first playthrough.
:)
A great games for Souls Veterans an newcomers alike. I've played every FROM game from Kingsfield and demon souls to this one on every platform, and this is by far my favorite.
Game to hard, cannot git gud

First off, great job!
ring

you will lose hours of your life and enjoy it other than fire giant fuk that man
Verily, this be a game of divine tier, a marvel most splendid. Without a doubt, it standeth as mine most cherished and favoured game. If thou dost not possess it yet, I implore thee, procure it forthwith and with utmost haste. Truly, it is an acquisition most worthy and delightful.
Please add a hard mode, I almost fell asleep.

After 129 hours immersed in the captivating world of Elden Ring, I can confidently say it's an absolute masterpiece that exceeds expectations in every aspect. FromSoftware has once again proven their unparalleled ability to craft a rich, immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming.

First and foremost, the world of Elden Ring is breathtakingly beautiful and meticulously crafted. Every corner is filled with stunning vistas, ancient ruins, and hidden secrets waiting to be discovered. The sense of exploration is unparalleled, with every new area offering a sense of wonder and excitement as you uncover its mysteries.

The gameplay mechanics are refined to perfection, blending challenging combat with deep RPG elements seamlessly. Every battle feels like a true test of skill and strategy, requiring careful timing and precision to overcome formidable foes. The variety of weapons, spells, and abilities allows for endless experimentation, ensuring that no two encounters are ever the same.

But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its rich lore and storytelling. The world is steeped in history and mythology, with every NPC, item, and location contributing to a vast tapestry of interconnected narratives. Exploring the lore of Elden Ring is a rewarding experience in itself, as you piece together the puzzle of its world and uncover the truth behind its mysteries.

Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, Elden Ring is a game with a soul. It's a testament to the passion and dedication of its developers, who have poured their hearts and souls into creating a truly unforgettable experience. It's a game that challenges you, inspires you, and leaves a lasting impression long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. It's a game that sets a new standard for the industry and reaffirms FromSoftware's status as one of the greatest developers of our time. Whether you're a fan of action RPGs or simply appreciate masterful game design, Elden Ring is an experience you won't want to miss.



BEST GAME EVER
games beautfiul
Is gud
why there is no ELDEN RING 2 :(
good game
I mean come on - quite possibly the greatest game I've ever played.  Ran through a few times on launch on PS5 and now making my way through on PC for the DLC.

Does not get much better than this.
Git good.
very addictive.

Can't wait for the DLC! Keep cooking, Fromsoft!

Just unbelievably good. BUY
good

The best game I‚Äôve ever played
borderline incomprehensible story and dogshit quests, i love it
pretty bussin

Im not just a lord, Im an ELDEN Lord. Presumably, thats because I've aged so much trying to get to and from Limgrave to Leyndell that Im no longer the maidenless young whippersnapper that I was but an elderly dead inside lord. 100/10 Would recommend it.
Very challenging but i love it

im touching myself
wonderful game. I have never hit my desk harder.
Hard af at first, gets better, then worse, then better and so on. there is points where you feel like theres nothing to do, but actually there is: level up by farming runes. don't make the mistake of ruining the best farm: the lazy dragon glitch, i accidentally killed him not knowing how the do the glitch properly so make sure to watch a yt vid before its too late. is the game hard: yes very, but it turned me from a below average video game enjoyer into a resilient half decent player. this game is so hard that when i am faced with challenges irl i say to myself "its not as hard as elden ring". you know its a good game when you learn life lessons from it, get trashed and still want to play it and drop 30 hours on it (I've never played a non-online game except for minecraft for more than 30 hours. I can definitely see myself playing this game for 100s of hours, if not now, some time in the future after i have had a break from the game. at first i took this game seriousley but like most things in life, they are better when you put a funny spin on them. DISCLAIMER: this game does NOT have difficulty options (I never knew until i bought the game and i immediatley got trashedand rage quit for 1 day but then watched yt vids on how to get better etc and now im actually enjoying the game). Have a good one.
Visually stunning with amazing game-play.  Starting is the hardest but very worth it.  One of the best game experiences I've had!

Its alright.
FROMSOFT. With a history of Expertly written story driven epic's, FROMSOFT is a Legend in this time. Gamers drool to get the next look or acquisition of a New IP. This is a game like no other in history. It's Dark Souls combat mechanics,it's extremely detailed unparalled art work,and a fantasy story that is deep and unforgiving at times, makes this the game of the Century unless undermined by a tremendous effort from FROMSOFT themselves,or another A Company who can produce this kind of game ,and background story, that would have to blow this away! The sheer size alone makes it epic like no other. Get the game. Nuff said.

A great addition to the "Souls universe"
I've not beaten it yet, but man it has DEPTH AF. It's been a minute since i've seen a game that had this much attention to detail. Dark Souls 3 on ultra is close but not clsoe enough. The ray graphics are insane in Elden ring too. even tho my pc can't run those really.
Overall: Game is fun, addicting, keeps you pulled in. Good Co-Op system, Build variety even tho i wished they was a little more(but i haven't explored everything just yet) Soild 8.5/10
Great game.
does not support ultra wide.
gud game :)

Try finger buthole
its hard but fun
So beautiful
really easy game, i cant believe how easy of a game it was. not even a challenge it was as easy as breathing, as easy as taking a silent fart and killing everyone just by the smell of it.  BRUHHHH my friends were like "ohh this game is so hard bleh blah bhel blahh" BS. i definitely did not die to tree sentinal 50 times. hek i didnt even get to use my crimson flask a single time just because the game is too damn hard....... i mean EASY TOO DAMN EASY.
miyazaki will never learn i guess, he will still be making these easy af games. BRUH someone must tell him that GODS like me walk among mortals. pftttt sekiro LAME AF, i definitellly DIDNT DIE TO A CHICKEN 10 times.
so easy gitgud nubs
A masterpiece
truly amazing, whole game is just beautiful, however its one of the easier souls game

Once you beat something worth while the game decides it gonna freeze, and by freeze i mean take the whole pc with it. Advice, don`t buy this game on pc, ever. The worst game on the best system, plain and simple. This game is still horrible and anyone i meet from FromSoftware will be getting punched in the face! have fun 
yes
It's pretty good. Is that enough words for a review yet?
This is a peerless RPG; it doesn't build a world so much as force you to infer the world that exists, always seemingly a bit out of reach.  That sense of tangible surety is what drives you (well, me) to fight on, to think after each death, to memorize patterns and count hits out loud to a rhythm.  This is the culmination of the soulslike formula and it's obvious in the maturity of its systems and the easy brilliance of the visuals, sound design, and resource management systems.  Genuinely one of the best games ever made and certainly worth playing for people of any skill level,
cool
el ring
great
its fire
c:
If i was rich-rich i would offer FromSoftware 1 million dollar tip.
really cant get into this game dont recommend
amazing game and very challenging
very good and top 10 games in this generation

you can die anywhere....definitely a yes for me
Fun asf
best game ever

I would write a more indepth review, but im too busy playing Elden Ring.
amazing game

There is nothing left needed to say about this masterpiece of a game, incredible gameplay, experience and story, nothing quite like it nowadays

W game Came back for a second playthrough on co op with a mate since he seen Kai Cenat play it Reminded me what being a victim is like. Lost a controller in the process but was worth it in the end
Should be enough to get you off the stress. And then build up even more stress
great game! and get good.

The only game where you can die 100 times to a boss, not change a thing and kill him on the next try 10/10
:3
its aight i guess

Must try. This is a masterpiece.

good .-.

first try.
I've spent a lot of hours in a lot of soulslikes, unfortunately this is the worst I've ever played. Idiotically simple bosses, idiotically easy progression system, achievements based on go, collect items, you have an achievement. I doubt that the  dlc will fix the game's problems. And as always, pvp is not playable, you come across the same builds all the time.
its pretty good

one the of the best open world ever created with a lot of mystery to discover. although its a really challenging game, its not like other souls games where you HAVE  to beat the bosses to progess the questline, you can just do other thing and come back later

HIGHLY RECOMMEND
elden ring
Needs more swamps

Malenia Blade Of Miquella?
played for 10+ hours before I even wanted to get to Margit. the best open world I've ever seen
i had a massive skill issue. But i got better. Amazing game how the fuck do people understand the whole game
very fun game :)
you know.... its alright
This game should be put into a museum because it is a work of art. The music, animations, storytelling, and everything is amazing. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge, and even if you don't there are ways to make the game easier and more enjoyable via using different items, forms of magic, summons, etc. I do not recommend this game for anyone who hates a challenge, and anyone who hates grindy games. You have to do a lot of grinding to beat the game. Of course you could be a natural and go crazy, and barely have to grind the game. but for most you will need to grind a considerable amount. Overall this is an amazing game, and you should buy it and the dlc that comes out soon.
Yes, It's really good. My first souls game, and I can't believe how much I love it, it's liberating playing and open world game with no hand holding. A Masterpiece.
Foul Tarnished get rekd

Good game.

mohg-lester445
Try finger but, hole
Sweet, easy to start
Short version: Great game, just didn't get the same out of it as my previous Dark Souls experiences.

Long version: This is a well made game with bookoos of content. My main thing is I went into this expecting another Dark Souls game, and that is not what I got. The DNA is there, of course, but I constantly found just a little something missing. Upon finishing the game my thought was "Have I become a Dark Souls purist? Would I have had more fun without summons", etc. This is by far the easiest Souls game that FromSoft have put out. I do think part of this stems from the fact that if you do practically any amount of exploring, you will get overleveled. The result of this was I never got any moment of triumph from killing a boss as I killed practically every boss I encountered in 1-3 tries, including the final boss. I also ran into the problem of doing most of my lore homework by reading descriptions and what-not, but I still had little idea what was going on, and so this hurt my enjoyment of the game somewhat significantly. So while there's a ton of different builds to play with, plenty of places to explore, and lots of bosses to fight, I left this game feeling empty. I don't wish to review this as negative as it's still a solid game, I may have just inaccurately set my expectations, and was disappointed when they weren't met.
it gave me white hairs like queen Ranni . praise the stars
[h1][b]A True Masterpiece Of Gaming[/b][/h1]

When it comes to video game awards, more often than not, they feel meaningless. Plenty of games have been awarded "Best of show" and achieved "WINNER OF 50 AWARDS!" only to be released and, at best, merely be very good and, at worst, not that good.

Elden Ring deserves all the praise it gets. It is an absolute modern masterpiece and one that will age like fine wine.

This is a soul-like game refined with an open world approach that in no way is bloated but instead uses it to its advantage. Take visuals. The world of Elden Ring is lovely and bleak. Beautiful and smile. Its a testament to FromSoftware that they have done a grand job of world building, lore and visually. There is a minor blemishes but nothing to ever take away that fantasy immersion of sheer wonder and terror that Elden Ring provides. The audio is just fantastic from is orchestral score to the ambience being done to perfection.

This leads to how exploration is implemented. One one hand Elden Ring is all about exploring and taking your time in getting more powerful and skillful, knowing when you can push through and when to retreat and come back to an area/boss when you're more powerful/capable. Rushing or just being stubborn will just see you get your ass handed to you again and again with very little, if any progress. Therefore exploring is highly encouraged but instead of it just being a chore, it becomes a thrill. Not just in curiosity sake (you may find something that makes you more powerful or becomes a vital aid, you may find an area that is too much which then serves as a goal) but in different kind of environments you can find. Elden Ring is so visually diverse that just finding a new area is a reward in itself.

And boy does Elden Ring make you work. If you're not familiar with Dark Souls type of gameplay, lets just say its punishing gameplay that pushes trial and error to the forefront, making you memorize enemies and environment hazards well enough to overcome them. Yes, you will get frustrated, angry and stressed in places. But this is part of the beauty of these types of games. They build up, knowing that, if you keep trying and learning, you will eventually overcome what is causing such pain and those emotions turn into feelings of relief and satisfaction, which make it very rewarding. And to Elden Ring's credit, its not as harsh as past FromSoftware games like Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice or other well known "Souls-Like" such as Nioh.

This is mostly because Elden Ring also expects you to be smart rather then overcome via 100% skill and hard work. Yes, it's all well and good being able to dodge roll and exploit openings from your enemies. But sometimes, you can take advantage of the level design, hiding in a room and cheesing the enemy with a bow while it thrashes around, doing its powerful attacks in futility. Or using a summon to distract the enemy and use hit and run attacks. it's all about "work smarter, not harder" Make no mixake, you will be working hard but you'll also find ways to make the burden less so.

Even its issues can be a blessing? A Boss exhibiting dumb AI? Enemies falling to their deaths? In most games, that lessens the experience. In Elden Ring? That's reprieve her. A "thank god it's happening" moment. You don't scoff at the small shops Elden Ring provides, you breathe a sigh of relief. And in terms of current issues, its really hard to fail the game. Maybe you can poke at the lack of lore? Well welcome to a FromSoftware game. It can feel longer than a usual soul-like game but that's just the nature of it being an Open-world game.

In reality, the only reason to not give Elden Ring a chance is because you don't like Action-Adventure and/or Open-World games. Otherwise, you owe it to yourself to play Elden Ring. Beautiful, fantastic gameplay with a ton of replayability. It's the kind of game to make you have faith in AAA. It's masterpiece.

Not my normal type of game, but I instantly fell in love.
Never would I have thought that I would enjoy getting man handled in any game more than in any Elden Ring.

this game is great dont get me wrong but the last boss the elden beast is so stupid i know you are going to say just be better i have beaten this game and 100% it on multiple different occasions and it is the elden beast that make me wanna kms thank you
I gotta say, as someone who didn't really like the Soulsborne genre and never tried to properly play through them before, Elden Ring is the best intro to this franchise. You will die, ALOT. But you will succeed eventually. Don't let the seemingly hard bosses get you down. Because you can and will rise to become the ELDEN LORD!

There's a reason why celebrities and mainstream figures actually like this game. You just have to be willing to jump in and find that reason yourself, fellow Tarnished. Be ready for the DLC, everyone!
Game looks amazing, is difficult but rewarding and mostly fair to the skills of the player. In general it's a well made game, but combat and targeting can feel slow and clunky at times and they could have easily added a tiny bit more narrative and directions to make things make more sense. I wouldn't want spoon feeding like in many other games, but in example it's wierd how the game intentionally pushes you forward through grace directions the "wrong way" in the beginning. This despite you being 20-30 levels underleveled and should go in the opposite direction to quest/grind the rest of the starting area instead.

It's well worth a buy if you like RPGs and challenging games. You'll probably hate it at first and curse your heart out, but just don't give up and you'll come to love it after a while. You might want to do yourself a favour and bring up a progress route map at times to check if you are where you are supposed to be instead of hating on the game and doubting yourself!
This game is wonderful and I do recommend you try it if its on sale BUT the game is not perfect the bosses will often feel very unfair and performance is still a very large problem. if you can look past those flaws this game is great 

solid 9/10

This is an absolutely amazing game that I will never beat. In many ways it is the best souls-like game that Fromsoft has put out, and certainly one of the best games in recent memory. If you've never played a souls-like game before, this might be the best place to start. Remember: keep calm, and try to time your dodges and attacks instead of button spamming. You can do it!


Try finger but hole

goty

gud
great game
BECOME THE ELDEN LORD TODAY!!!! ONLY $59.99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best RPG game and universe I played in a long time
Marry me Malenia 
Marry me Ranni
Yes

An amazing game. There's so much to do, and so many styles to try out, you could easily play for hundreds of hours and still not have experienced everything. THIS is Gold Standard AAA Gaming, look no further. Sure it's hard to get into, sure the difficulty ramp is a tad bit steep, but keep at it, and you'll be Elden Lord before you know it.... and with your favorite class as well. There's something for everyone - the damage-hungry player who is way too greedy, to the tank who LIKES getting hit and feeling powerful, and everything in-between those two and not. Give it a try. Stick with it. It'll grow on you.
great game veryfun
I can't fuck my 9'8 mommy Marika >:d So ima fuck the devs in the ass.
git gud
yes
best final fantasy ever
One of the greatest games of this century
reeeeee
Legend
JUST BEAUTIFUL
Greatest RPG in my opinion. Too good to pass up!!
One of the games so far
It always draws me back in 10/10 would grind through again.
i'm a soul's veteran with over 3,000 hours in the series. this is the greatest game ever.
Best game i have ever played
fun
After finishing the game, I spent a few days thinking about what to write in this review, and honestly, I'm speechless. So just buy it and be happy.
Por la salida de Elden Ring, Elden Ring... Es tu salida, saliste del videojuego Pfff. Mando un saludito a las grrrr, y en verdad a todos ustedes de Elden Ring...

I got 150 hours on the PS5. Got all trophies and all. Gonna try and do that here on PC. It's def one of the best games of my life (saying that as a 90s kid who's stuck in mid and late 2000s games and keeps b!tching that we don't get good games anymore.) Really, it's rare for a game to grab my atention nowadays. The ratio is something like one game every two years. This is on my top 5 games of all time. Lightning in a gawd darn bottle.
one of the greatest games that i have ever played, the story gameplay and graphics make for a very impressive experience!
the world of elden ring will suck you in for hours on end as you adventure the different parts of the map coming across different boss encounters at random times.
the game is very user friendly for new players but will still be a great challenge for players who may have played other from software titles.
the story of elden ring is very well thought out linking most of the main bosses together and making you want to keep coming back for more.
overall the game is great giving a challenging but fun experience that i highly recommend!
 
also the seamless coop mod is a great way to play with friends as the in game multiplayer issnt the best.
good

everything
Masterpiece
I watched a rock fall off a cliff for 66 hours
Very good game, you get hugged by a weird woman that sleeps with corpses! Would recommend!

Too expensive game, initially you pay 60 for the game plus the rest for all the keyboards and mouses that break
wrote a message that says "Secret Passageway ahead" in front of literally the first cliff in the game, and next to that message is countless bloodstains.
breathtaking scenes and voice acting. 

*SPOILER* 
[spoiler] loved when john elden gives you his ring post game [/spoiler]
One of the best games I've ever played, in my top 5 definitely. If you like taking down big bosses in a badass way, and don't mind doing it taking 500 tries, get the game. Really fun.
good
big sword
the game is the best

Great game, very long and somewhat difficult but I find the challenge to be fun, with mods like the seamless coop mod on nexus mods u can easily play with friends but the in-game coop can be annoying and difficult, apart from the issue with coop which can be fixed easily, i have no other issues with the game
good game
best game ever
Master piece. Must have in your collection.

But quite easy for any hardcore soul-players who like challenging themself
June 21st will change the world (again).
gud
best game ever created
One of the best action RPGs I have every played. Picked it up during release, sucked at it and put it back in the backburner but recently tried it again and now I can not put it down!! Once you get the hang of it, IT IS SO WORTH IT!!!!!
beautiful game
the game is awesome
                            .
IDK man this game slaps hard
good
Dumb ass game actually is so overhyped im good at these games i pretty easily played through it and i went into a big area in the roundable table and lose 120k runes because i didnt know that an enemy was there cause no indication. I went back to kill him and gain my runes and they werent there, i didnt die after he killed me or anything else, i went straight back. doesnt display anything. so overhyped its not funny, the art is beautifal as are the combat mechanics. except the only bad thing is how they dont do anything for new players or any indication about where your going or what is ahead. I play offline so player messages arent a thing for me.
read the writing on the ground, my fellow tarnished have saved me more times than I can count
First time playing a game of this style. Found it extremely enjoyable. Very difficult at times, but the game is forgiving enough that it's really on you if you set yourself back by losing a ton of runes or progress. There's also pathways around most hard enemies if you don't feel like taking them on at that time. If you're someone like me that prefers more casual gameplay, you can get that in this game. I've been tending to over-level and then go back for the harder bosses so I don't have to stress too much and I can just enjoy the game. But that's my play-style.

A ton of stuff to do. Biggest drawback is getting lost and not knowing where to go. I read a lot of guides and recommended pathways. Some questlines will cancel out others. Alternate endings. Tons of things to know in this game but it sucks you in.
good game.  you buy game now
Finished this game in PS5. I will continue my journey on this game on PC. One of the best!
use the co op mod
Been 200 hours and I'm still finding new stuff
Its fun but it kicked my ass
gud game
dog ahead
good
so so so so so good, your just gonna need guides sometimes and no life
Sure, you could just play the game through and have a great time, but you could also browse Reddit and Youtube for 2 years after and get a PhD in Elden Ring/real world architecture, history, art history, metaphysics and mythology. 

I have never played a game that is so intellectually rewarding the deeper you dig. Even after 257 hours (and counting) I still only have vague theories of what an Elden Ring actually is. 10/10.
amazing game, polished right off the rip. waiting for the DLC now, can't wait to suffer again! 10/10
love bloodborne and ds3 way more ironically enough but this is still rlly good
i regret everything
good
W game. So far I have only defeated godrick and a few other mini bosses but I am injoying the game.
amaziing game man
gud
close-up toes and magic, very good
Played it for about 2 hours when it first came out, then got annoyed it doesn't support 3440x1440 resolution. 
If you select this option, picture is still 16:9, but with black bars on the side. 
I'll get back to the game when developers join us in 2024.
I love miqueller. Wowie, I do hope he won't die and perish a horrible and agonizing death once the dlc is out.
Malenia is a monster
i really like Malenias gyat from face two. i recomand edging while you are in lategame
i wished my horses balls would shrink in cold areas like red dead
Great game! Lot's to do!
grope alexander
nice
cool
Fromsoft's work has led toward this amazing, epic RPG. The only issue is with replayability, running around the map and side quests can become tedious after a few playthroughs.
W ring
Ranni
Bought this game back in 2022, I regret every bit for not playing it as soon as possible on the contrary, I do not regret 100%'ing this game at this particular time. It's been a LONG time that I had this much fun with a piece of media quite like this. FromSoftware I am looking forward to everything you're putting out on the market. TAKE MY PENNIES!!
Its the best game ive ever played it is beuitiful and yet extremley difficult and complex 10/10 game definently should try out
can't wait for the dlc
This is literally the best game I have ever played in my life.
good
Sigma ohio skibidi goonlord
good
Honestly a masterpiece, definitely one of the best games out at the moment.
- Insane scenery
- Smooth combat (Pvp is meh though)
- Story is pretty deep
- Good boss design
- Open world is full of secrets you can discover
Good game me like
death... so much death
"Elden Ring: A Haunting Symphony of Beauty and Despair"

In the realm of Elden Ring, where shadows dance and light whispers, there lies a world of haunting beauty and unyielding darkness. It‚Äôs a place where ethereal landscapes stretch into infinity, painted with the melancholy brushstrokes of a forgotten era. This is a game that doesn‚Äôt just challenge you; it consumes you.

Elden Ring is a masterwork of stark contrasts. It‚Äôs a dream woven from the fabric of nightmares, where every horizon is both a promise and a threat. The scenery captivates with its ruined splendor, each ruin and dungeon imbued with a silent, sorrowful history. The world breathes with an ancient life, whispering secrets to those brave enough to listen.

Yet, this haunting beauty is but a siren‚Äôs call. Elden Ring doesn‚Äôt coddle or soothe. It stands indifferent to your struggles, a monolith of uncaring cruelty. The land is littered with the bones of the defeated, a testament to its unforgiving nature. Here, every step is a battle, every victory hard-fought and hollow.

As you traverse this cursed landscape, you are met with adversaries that embody the world‚Äôs relentless spirit. Each foe is a dark reflection of the game's harsh beauty‚Äîsome are grotesque yet mesmerizing, some monstrous yet majestic. The combat is a grim dance of death, demanding precision and patience, where even a moment‚Äôs lapse can lead to ruin.

The lore of Elden Ring is a tapestry woven from cryptic fragments and half-remembered myths. It does not spoon-feed you its story; it lets you uncover it, through exploration and peril. It‚Äôs a journey of discovery that is both rewarding and maddening, as you piece together a narrative that is as elusive as the wind.

This is a game that harkens back to an era where games did not hold your hand, where each failure was a lesson etched in the harshest of tones. Elden Ring doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre sick, weary, or if your heart is fragile. It demands your best, your utmost resolve, and then some. It‚Äôs a stern teacher, its lessons carved in the scars of countless battles.

Yet, within this brutal indifference lies a form of grace. There is a profound beauty in its darkness, a poetry in its pain. Each defeat deepens your resolve, each victory, a fleeting taste of triumph that leaves you craving more. Elden Ring is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a saga of persistence against insurmountable odds.

In the end, Elden Ring is not just a game; it‚Äôs an experience‚Äîa darkly beautiful journey through despair and triumph. It is a reminder that in the face of unyielding adversity, there is a strange and haunting beauty to be found. It is a challenge to be embraced, a world to be conquered, one death at a time.
good game
fun
yes
Great game if you like being killed over and over by a fat and skinny duo.
behold, something incredible!
My number 1 favorite game that is a gem
tye shi

Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece, an epic blend of intricate world-building, deep lore, and challenging gameplay. FromSoftware has outdone itself, creating a vast, interconnected world teeming with secrets, unique environments, and diverse enemies. The open-world design feels organic, encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity with rich storytelling and immersive detail.

The combat system, true to FromSoftware's tradition, is punishing yet deeply satisfying. Each encounter requires strategy and skill, making every victory feel earned. The customization options, from character builds to gear, offer incredible depth, allowing players to tailor their experience to their playstyle.

Visually, Elden Ring is stunning. The atmospheric landscapes, detailed character models, and hauntingly beautiful art design create an unforgettable experience. The soundtrack complements the game's tone perfectly, enhancing the emotional weight of the narrative.

In summary, Elden Ring is a triumph in game design, offering a challenging and richly rewarding adventure. It's a must-play for fans of the genre and a shining example of how video games can be both art and entertainment.
Try finger, but hole
Elden Ring should be gatekept.
Best Game
10/10
Addicting.
Pretty easy actually
played through 5 times on ps5 and now starting fresh on PC for the dlc.  Loving it all over again.
Great game. Interesting lore, fun gameplay, etc. An open world DS3(which is not a bad thing, DS3 is great as well). Build Variety is great here, only problem is that after a few playthroughs the game becomes a bit boring since you know where most everything is. Still replayable if you switch up your builds though. Buy if you like soulslike games, but if you have a problem with difficulty maybe avoid, early hours might leave a bad taste in your mouth if you don't know what you're doing.
Goated
I love being ass raped 1000 times than i ass rape them 1!!!!
ggs

If you like hard games. This is probably up your alley.

One of the hardest parts is the loading prog....It crashes 2 out of 5 loading screens if your bar stops moving its stuck don't waste your time and just close your game... Progress could have been lost and I heard you can be banned for doing this if you were in pvp... so take that to heart.. still its not like you have a choice loading screen crashes is part of the game and part of the difficulty lol.
GOTD
Do I need to say more?
it is very realisitc and it is fun fighting monsters and bosses i very do recommend this game
Such a legendaray game
I hate myself so much but i gotta keep playing!!!
game good! u buy! with dlc! cry and piss a little! then beat game! then happy!
Yeah, I'd buy it
One of the best games I have ever played. MASTERPIECE
good game
Good game kinda hard to learn all the different weapons and magic that can be attained.
this game reminds me of the OG Xbox game Ninja Gaiden and to be honest its just perfect for an adventure dungeon slasher. you can do so much stuff before even touching the main quest line. definitely give this game a shot you wont be disappointed and don't be afraid to watch some guide videos or read some guides they really help you get familiar.
very fun game
DOPE!

Super good game, supreme graphics and replayablity and overall best souls game must buy
tarnished
A very late review considering how long ago I played this, but this is my favourite game of all time. The level of effort they put into this game is just unmatched, and I don't see any game topping this anytime soon
GOOD GAME !
best world design best bosses best soundtrack
i like it i have played it
for sure one of the best games ever made.
if you like stealth, it has it.
big weapons? got em.]
magic or faith? in the game.
bows, crossbows, great bows, thowing weapons, crafting, upgrading, leveling, dress up!
its got it all. with a story so deep you'll likely watch an entire series of videos to get just the jist.

I got gaming addiction relapse because of this game. 10/10
.
Finger, but hole.

In all honestly though, this being the first souls game I have ever played, it was also one of the best games i have ever touched. There is so much to explore, collect and bosses to fight and so many play styles to swap between. This game is what a beautifully finished work looks like and was made with love. 

Thank you for this creation because this is possibly my favourite game
git gud
gud game
Top 3 games OAT
GOTY for a reason
a great intro to all souls games
Excelent game
Very fun Game
touch grace
It's elden ring
Top 3 games oat for sure
Great Gaem proves a challenge with the mix of PVE boos fights being challenging and not always straight forward for newer players and the PVP aspect of invasion to keep you on your toes while exploring the world and dungeons.
good game
Played on xbox for well over 200 hours, and have about 30 ish on pc. Best game of the decade hands down.
Masterpiece ! As far as I'm concerned, nothing else to say.
I've died more time falling off cliffs than the actual enemies. Worth is tho for my pookie bears Ranni and Radahnüó£Ô∏è
goat
idk what everyone's talking about bro this games way to easy i beat Margot in 30 minutes of my first time playing and it just got less hard from there all i did was search up a good guide for beginners and now im level 478 and have beaten the entire game. even NG+ doesn't change anything much but make it honestly easier to level up. Mods if your reading this please consider changing the HP of bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree. i would like to have to grind a little to get strong enough to beat a boss. because in all honesty Elden Ring is too easy... Even then after around 25 hours on this game it was fun, maybe needs a little more of a challenge but other than that the game is good
really good game. I think they're are better reviews than mine, so check them out if you want more detail. Recommend playing 10/10.
I've played this game for 10 hours and it feels like I haven't even seen a tenth of the world
n
Masterpiece
Best game
Great game, but terrible enemy design.
best game i have played ‚ò† good luck
ish good trust 100

I have not seen my family in five years
radahn sold me fent
Literally the best game I have played in over 10 years, you can not miss out on this game.
Game's just good
best game ever
Hard at first but once you get the hang of things it becomes fairly easy and very fun,
:)
Good game, just poorly optimized

Game is good. Would recommend.
this game is good, trust.
A flawed masterpiece getting held back by stupid stuff like no Ultrawide support, bad performance, a lot of bosses copy pasted around and being capped at 60 fps for some reason
amazing
It makes sense now why this game is never on sale.  Might be one of the most beautiful, fantastical and refreshing games I have ever played.  A new world, new lore, different character tropes, this game has it all.  I cant believe it took me this long to finally play this game.  I love it!!!!  One of the greatest games in existence and I am all in!!  10 outa 10
In my opinion a good game to get used to the souls games as this is one of the easiest of them all.

(I started at this game)
Honest thoughts at first I was really confused about what to do in this game, as there is no direct storyline it's kind of you go explore and do what you want. But once I started to learn stuff and all the objectives I instantly wanted to play this game more. It honestly is a perfect game and takes a little bit to get use to but then just make sure you stay on top of exploring every area to the fullest!
Literally the best game in the world. I beat every boss in the game no words!
good
yes
its cweel
Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune!
one of the best games you will ever play. 

Elden ring is a very difficult and infuriating game which will push you hard, you will die many times to the same boss over and over and have to bare through complex maps, swamps and hoards of enemies. 

however that feeling of finally killing a boss you dies tens of times to is amazing and will make you feel so fulfilled. 

the boss fights are amazingly coded and look stunning, the map is large and also beautiful with hundreds of different areas for you to explore and thousands of different weapons for you to use depending on your play style. it won game of the year for a reason and i highly recommend it to anyone who owns a decently good computer.
This game is a masterpiece.
elden ring
Must play for anyone that considers themselves a gamer. obvious is obvious. the entire Souls series is a must play.
The best spent ‚Ç¨60 of my entire life.
Its a very good game, totally worth the price, the only thing i personal dont like is the coop system, but in overall, is totally worth it.

[spoiler]Boc and I are a "thing"[/spoiler]
‚òπÔ∏è
I first played this on console when it released and quite enjoyed it. Having made the switch to PC gaming, i wanted to replay it on Steam to be ready for the DLC.

Some people will tell you that Elden Ring is the easiest game from FromSoftware and well, they're right to some extent. This mainly lies in two things: first, the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you're feeling overwhelmed to come back later, after getting more levels and gear. That's something you couldn't really do in their previous entries. Also, you have access to a variety of powerful tools: weapons, skills, builds and summons that can make your journey much easier.

You want to do it the hardest way possible? Great, skip those, you're in for a challenge. You could use some help? Use them or summon a friend to assist you. I can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don't want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss, but still want to experience the FromSoft touch. There's no better way, just play the way that gives you the most fun.

The game is Exploration with a capital E. No symbols to tell you where to go, no quest diary. It can be intimidating, specially if you tend to have FOMO. The good part is that, by closely looking at the map, you will find clues to places of interest. The play area is huge, so is the content. At times i felt like it was too much, but at least you can't accuse FromSoft to deliver you an incomplete game.

Some graphical assets are heavily reused, that's true, but it didn't really bother me that much. Speaking of graphics, if you like dark fantasy atmospheres, oh boy, you're in for a treat.

That game is making FromSoft accessible to a wider array of players and it's perfectly fine with me.
I think you already know that you want this game. It's amazing!
Yep.
love it

BEST GAME EVER.
Best opened world I've ever played despite the harsh difficulty. But if those of you have any trouble or feel like giving up, just reevaluate or even start all over as a magic user and just play around with it. F anyone telling you not to use magic or not to use summons and what not and enjoy the game for what it is. Even play co-op with friends. As someone who has played this game without summons or magic my first play through, it is very frustrated indeed. Other than the difficulty, there's still fun to have exploring, finding mobs that are easy as hell or locations that you can "thrive" in before having to face the main bosses or sections. Even if you're not a soulsbourne player and want to experience optimal game play with interesting lore and mechanics, then Elden Ring is perfect. If you like Zelda breath of the wild or tears of the kingdom, then you would love this game. Can't wait for the DLC coming June 21st! See ya'll there brave Tarnished...
Reject matrix, obtain Elden Ring.
Best Game Ahead
so sigma
ranni
i have no idea what im doing but its quite satisfying when you finally kill a boss on the 108th attempt
Amazing game probably one of the best ones i've ever played it's such an amazing experince with great graphics and open world. Warning that this game does NOT help you in almost any way it's basically "here's our game, figure it out." Really great when you know what you're doing!
I hit a brick wall halfway through but loved it up til then!
this game almost in every aspect worse then ds3
Best Game
game good, godskin duo bad.
great game
The capstone of my gaming career.
NO MAIDENS?

I've never played a Souls game before and was scared to fight when I started. However, the deeper I got into the game, the more I respected the fragility of your character and the satisfaction of defeating a challenging opponent. After 150 hours, I can proudly say that I am still scared to fight but have gotten pretty good at it.

While playing, I was going through a difficult time in my personal life. Immersing myself in this game helped me make sense of the "bosses" and "demigods" I had to face in the real world and helped me get through my hardships. The beautifully tragic world and horrifying abominations I faced fit so perfectly in a heartfelt story that I'll think about long after the final battle.

If you need to face your demons, I highly recommend this game. I also promote using the Seamless Co-op mod so you can enjoy it with your friends without interruption.
gud
Didn't expect to be slamming desk so much, very good game
This map is wayyyyy too big and filled with pointless and redundant side content, cut down the map size to 1/2 and get rid of all the mini dungeons that dont have to do with story or have an important item at the end. combat is great, best of the souls likes imo with the greatest depth and variety.
Elden Ring has quickly become one of my all-time favorite games, and with over 120 hours spent in its mesmerizing world, I can confidently say it‚Äôs a masterpiece of modern gaming. From the moment you step into its beautifully crafted landscape, you're transported into a realm where every detail is meticulously designed, every corner brimming with adventure and mystery.

The game‚Äôs visual beauty is truly breathtaking. The lush environments, intricate castles, and hauntingly beautiful ruins create an atmosphere that is both immersive and awe-inspiring. Whether you're exploring dense forests, scaling towering mountains, or delving into dark dungeons, Elden Ring‚Äôs world is a feast for the eyes and a playground for the adventurous spirit.

One of the standout features that has enhanced my experience immensely is the seamless co-op mod. Playing with friends transforms an already incredible game into an unforgettable social adventure. The mod integrates multiplayer elements flawlessly, allowing for seamless exploration and cooperative battles without the usual interruptions. Sharing the journey with friends, strategizing for epic boss fights, and uncovering hidden secrets together adds an extra layer of depth and enjoyment to the game.

Elden Ring‚Äôs gameplay mechanics are superbly balanced, providing a challenging yet rewarding experience. The combat is fluid and satisfying, with a diverse array of weapons, spells, and abilities that cater to various playstyles. The open-world design encourages exploration and rewards curiosity, making every discovery feel meaningful.

The storytelling in Elden Ring is another highlight. The lore is rich and deeply woven into the fabric of the game, inviting players to piece together the narrative through environmental storytelling, character interactions, and item descriptions. This approach creates a sense of intrigue and engagement that keeps you invested in the game world.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is not just a game; it‚Äôs an epic adventure that captivates your imagination and challenges your skills. Its stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and seamless co-op capabilities make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Highly recommended for those looking to embark on an unforgettable journey with friends in one of the most beautiful and well-crafted worlds ever created.
my glorious elden ring... where do i begin? i love this game more than life itself. this game COMPLETES me. i am nothing without it, and it is nothing without me as its elden lord. i call upon the graces of the stars, meet me in the next life. i love you elden ring!

easy game don't fret

GOAT
Leaving at Not recommended until I finish this first playthrough trying to run a pure strength naked grafted blade wielding lunatic who hasn't bothered to look up how you unlock crafting yet after 100 hours. Was told I should look up guides, but I never touch the stuff in 30 years of playing crash bandicoot and world of warcraft and don't plan to start now.

I have uninstalled this 12 times and it keeps ending up back on my computer, this is bad design, It should prevent me from downloading it again after I uninstall so I stop suffering.
5 stars

No le entend√≠ nada, pero que juegazo
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends the best elements of FromSoftware‚Äôs signature design with the epic fantasy world crafted by George R. R. Martin. As a player, you‚Äôll embark on a perilous quest across the Tarnished Lands, a realm shattered by the shattering of the Elden Ring.

üî• Combat and Challenge: 5/5

The combat system is both punishing and rewarding. Each swing of your sword feels weighty, and every dodge or parry requires precise timing. The challenge is intense, but overcoming it brings an unparalleled sense of accomplishment.

üåÑ World Design: 5/5

The Tarnished Lands are breathtakingly beautiful and hauntingly desolate. From the towering cliffs to the twisted forests, every location feels handcrafted with care. The interconnected world encourages exploration, and secrets await around every corner.

üëπ Creatures and Bosses: 5/5

Prepare to face off against awe-inspiring bosses and grotesque creatures. Their designs are both terrifying and captivating. Each encounter is a dance of death, and learning their patterns is essential for survival.

üé∂ Soundtrack: 5/5

The haunting melodies and epic orchestral compositions elevate the game‚Äôs atmosphere. Whether you‚Äôre battling a colossal boss or riding through the plains on horseback, the music immerses you in the world of Elden Ring.

üìú Lore and Storytelling: 5/5

George R. R. Martin‚Äôs influence shines through in the game‚Äôs lore. The fragmented history, cryptic NPCs, and hidden tales create a rich narrative tapestry. Piecing it all together is a rewarding experience.

üåü Overall: 10/10

Elden Ring is a triumph‚Äîa fusion of challenging gameplay, breathtaking visuals, and a captivating world. It‚Äôs a game that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Praise the sun, fellow tarnished!
This game makes me say things I never thought I would say 10/10 would recommend :)
good
Im the elden lord, lord of elden himself.
goon
My girlfriend Melina sadly had to go away, but my new girlfriend (wife) Ranni will be with me forever!
Solo juegalo, vas a sufrir, enojarte y tal vez sentiras que no puedes avanzar, pero seamos honestos vas a disfrutar cada parte de este juego
amazing game
This is just dark souls 3: 2 the sequel and I'm all here for it 10/10 Dark souls 3 is still better in alot of aspects but when I go back to play it I keep pressing Y to do things and A to jump k1ll me.
Please excuse the paltry thirteen hours of playtime; my original 120+ was done on Playstation. I've since come back to the game on PC after building a custom rig and in anticipation of the DLC, but enough about that. Elden Ring changed the way I look at video games, full stop. From start to finish (and more than a few NG+) Elden Ring captivated me with its utter vastness, free and rewarding exploration, and deep lore. Even in my new playthrough, I'm still discovering different places to meet characters I've seen elsewhere, alternate quest rewards, and staggering challenges I'd altogether missed. Elden Ring is intensely difficult, but by God, do NOT let that stop you from experiencing the magic this game possesses.
This is my second time purchasing Elden Ring. The first was on my xbox one s about 2 weeks after release, and I had no idea what the game was about. I had heard that it was like Dark Souls but I had never watched or heard of Soulsbourne games till halfway through my play through of the game. Needless to say, this game is a masterpiece. Since my purchase on xbox i have bought sekiro, ds3, bloodbourne, and nioh and none of them have topped my experience with Elden Ring. It took me so long to beat the game because I gave up at Radahn and didn't touch the game for like 9 months. I came back though, after my friend beat the game and wouldn't shut up about it. I am so glad i did because this is now my favorite game of all time. I only recently got my PC but one of the first games I bought was this. I can't recommend this game enough. A warning though: this game is super difficult if you are new to Fromsoft games. You will die a lot and it will be frustrating but if you decide to push through it, it will bring unbelievable satisfaction. Hope this helps some people find this game!
thank you elden ring

this game made me rethink life deicsions but in a good way

I do highly recommend this game, but when I say that this gamebhas problems I really mean it.
One of the game‚Äôs major problem is with boss designs, with a game this big I can understand why the bosses weren‚Äôt focused as much but man it feels like your just waiting half the time to be able to attack. The boss will sometimes do 50 attacks in the air or do a bunch of delayed attacks that aren‚Äôt natural at all like how the other souls like games are. And you can only get 1 or 2 attacks or even none at all because the boss jump on the other side of the arena or startup another mvc ass combo on you. You should be reward for your patiences instead of having to wait even more its like your trying follow instructions on the cook books you get everything ready and start the stoce you burn yourself a little bit but you dodge and maneuver your way into something gordan ramsey will fine ok, but stove desides it wants to get hotter and burns your food and throws on the floor all the patiences and maneuvering for nothing(sorry if that was a bad analogy).
lastly I think the second half takes a nose dive in quality. There so many re use stuff that the area just doesn‚Äôt feel unique. The concentrated snow field I thought would be a amazing place with snow theme enemys like caelid, but it end up being more like caelid than I thought because they literally just took the dogs and enemies from caelid to there and they just don‚Äôt fit at all. And nothing there is memorable at all I only remember the Fire giant and that shitty castle you have to go through to go to Haligtree. And the last area was lowkey a nothing burger Placidus was a really good boss, but the run back is ass and the godskin duo is the worst design 2v1 boss ever I dont even need to talk about it you already know how ass they are and Maliketh has all the problems I talked about before with most of the bosses in the game.
All in all this game is still amazing and that first half is better than any souls game if you think that the bosses are a side dish like ds1. But that second half has some many problems and the bosses have a lot of problems, but I know that bosses in the dlc are gonna be fantastic and the area is going to be the best area ever. 

i would recommend the game until the dramonic tree sentinel
i played this because of kai cenat
Malenia Gyat a gyat
its ok
Recommend it, 10/10.

Varre is a bitch, Hoarah Loux is badass, and Pastor Miriel is my new god.
its aii
If there was a tier above S, this'd be it
fun
shitting ma sel mate
This game is pain. 


Overall, good game and worth the price :)
This game is literally perfect, the combat, the cathartic feeling of winning, the exploration, the items, the npcs, the story. Play it, you won't regret it. literally won game of the year.
MUY BIEN
good game it makes me mad
yes
This game is a gem
Without a doubt one of the best games ever made. One of the very few games that feels like a "next gen" release. Unmatched in scale and consistency. The minor flaws people like to point out are trivial.
good game
I eat golden rune 1s for breakfast
this game can flciker munt for 28 hours
Ê¢ÖÁê≥Â®úËÄÅÂ©ÜÔºÅÊ¢ÖÁê≥Â®úËÄÅÂ©ÜÔºÅÊ¢ÖÁê≥Â®úËÄÅÂ©ÜÔºÅÊ¢ÖÁê≥Â®úËÄÅÂ©ÜÔºÅ
its alright, i just suck
Even better the second time
God Game
It is skibidi sigma and very not beta I would edge
Not usually one for Souls games, but Elden Ring is different. 

The open world, the story, the characters, and the sheer variety of ways you can approach everything is a lot of fun. The only thing I wish this game had was some kind of way to track quests, as it's very easy to mess one or multiple up as you proceed through the game. Other than that though, FromSoft did an exceptional job. Can't wait for the DLC this Summer!
GUT GAME, very fun
Amazing game very hard when you first begin but after time ive learned to love the game
LEBRON JAMES, SCREAM, FOR ELDEN RING
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Good. Did it. Would do it again and again. Bloodbourne on PC next please.
Just darksoul 3.5 
Bad Camera. Most of the time you will be fighting the camera  
Unbalanced. Enemys have infinte stamina and poise so have fun rolling and hitting, 90% of this game also (Fashion souls) why even armor.
Input delay is tweak for even worst performace. Why even have this when bosses have 16 hit combos and you cant adjust after an attack. Thats just not fun.
Enemy AI is borderline broken ( Seeing thru walls, arrows/ ALL Projectiles have PathFollowing , hit thru walls, AGGRO OF ASURAS WRATH with eye sight of an Atlanta hawk, knowing when you heal, etc)
Having all of your usesful items in one slot is just unorganzied in a combat game.
Making a game frustrating on purpose isnt fun or good game design 
The reuse of enemys and assits are also lazy and hopefully the dlc will introduce change going forward but as of now the base game needs ALOT of work 


hard
Awesome!
Meta

Praise Ye Tarnished
i have had this game for like a year. I never played it until now, and in 5 days, i have 80hrs. this game is cool but it's fair if you need to rely on the wiki to help you a decent amount. sometimes this game isn't very clear.
Very fun and dark !
FUN
It's alright.
Great game!
This game is simply great in nearly every way. I wasn't the type of player to play a Fromsoft game for a long time. Now that I'm older I'm able to appreciate it and understand that the game is about learning the mechanics and how you use them vs just getting a build and rolling through a game. The overall design of this game has a few flaws but it takes advantage of a lot of them in a lot of ways. I have a few hundred hours in on my PS4 and bought it on here with the intent to mod it soon. and with all this playtime it's easy to stumble into a tunnel or an item or a boss that you've never seen before.
Makes me want to shove my dick in a waffle iron, 10/10
amazing
really easy game
best game i have played
Makes you feel like a dark souls game
game is actually easy 

Good game. My dad hates me now
10/10 would play for the first time again
gud game. easiest souls i rekon
Good Fight
yeahhhh
nicegame

my penis

Nunca gostei de jogos de mundo aberto, pensei que seria o mesmo com elden ring, por√©m, subverteu minhas expectativas. O mundo, apesar de ser vasto, √© cheio de conte√∫do, recomendo
The best.
I hate this game but can't seem to stop playing it. Send help.
Masterpiece
Banger, Nothing more to say
Greatest game Ive ever played

the best of from software
its ok
bought again on PC just to replay the entire game with the seamless coop mod playing with friends. That and the reforged mod have me grinning ear to ear like its my first play through.
Easily the best souls game and potentially one of the best/most fun games of all time. Decently difficult bosses with fun mechanics. 10/10 would rip my dick off from Malenia again.
keep them coming
best game I played so far
elden ring!
a real jeans-creamer of a game
quite good mate
nah
easy game make it harder
fun
Masterclass in worldbuilding and gameplay design.
I like!

Jump down big hole, parkour.
Get fire ending.

Pretty good!
This game has stolen my LIfe. i have 100% this game on multiple consoles, and multiple modpacks, save yourselves
its goog
coolio game for souls :D
I hate the game, but it's good
goty for a reason

quite easy when you know the fundamentals of the game and when you get the biulds down like a blood biuld and your on ng+7 its so satisfying aswell as being level 713


Great game!
so good I had to buy it twice 
within the first 10 minutes of being released into the open world i got caught in a driveby with a guy on his horse
died 48 times fighting the fire giant poggers
10/10
The best
i dont really understand the hype 
super repetitive and boring
foolish story and overall game design
so over simplified that borderlines massive neglect
just lazy work
best souls like game ever. perfect game if you want a challenge
Vast are to explore right off the bat. Open world map and ease of travel have changed the game for these fromsoftware games. Just started but excited for what is in store.  Do we get to see patches again?
10/10
Crystalians gave me cancer. Rani cured it. 100% recommend üëç.
Love this game!
its elden ring

Yes
Big sword = Big damage
this game is good but the boss i hate
I love eldening the ring
Jump + Smash = win
l;jhhjfj
Long time fan of FromSoftware! 
Easily some of their best work hands down, lots of things have already been said about Elden Ring so i'm gonna keep it brief. 

Most accessible Soulsborne game to date, if you're struggling with bosses there is so much you can swap out or use to gain advantage. ABSOLUTELY the best game of FromSoftware to start with, might even ignite your passion for FromSoftware starting here.

Story is confusing but satisfying to uncover yourself and if you can there are so many people who delve into the lore online meaning if you every want to scratch that itch this game has a massive fan content base to back it up.

Gameplay is great, it's very weighty and smooth, Fights are well put together however some bosses have FromSoftware power creep and are getting faster and faster so some bosses feel a tad overtuned which CAN be tiring for some but for me the thrill of beating these crazy bosses outweighs that feeling.
Lategame leveling can be a pain if you don't use farming spots and farming spots can get suuuper boring at times.

Community is very helpful in my searches, people will help with builds, there are tons of in depth guides and tons of summons for encounters/areas.
PvP is hit or miss in my books. Sometimes it's great! nail biting action against worthy players, the thrill of defending a host with your life is always fun and their death although saddening makes me want to learn from my mistakes and guard the host better next time.
Other times?? PvP is plain awful. Some players only use the absolute best of the best gear so they can cheese kill you or the host. Hackers have in my travels popped up more than a handful of times, Easy Anti cheat what can you do.

It's a grand experience an easy easy easy 10/10 game for me. Cannot WAIT for the DLC! 
Best of luck to you if you buy Elden Ring! and i hope you have as much of a wonderful time as i did!
[spoiler] For the Kale! For the Nomads!! MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!!! [/spoiler]
elden ring
fun but hard
You die, then you die some more... learn, adapt, overcome. 

11/10
erm... what the sigma
Great game. Dont have a setup anymore though
10/10 would play again
FUCK THIS GAME !!!!!! I WANNA KILL MYSELF (ill be continuing to play very soon this is actually a really well made game im just super angry right now)
Yeah its that good
masterpiece
real niggas approve of this
Very good game. Bosses can be hard, but beating em makes you HARDER
MUST
(‡≤•·ó¢‡≤•)
havent beat margit yet
very hard
maybe im just ass
I am late to the party. Having said that, I have not ever enjoyed any other souls-like game. I tried a few, got to angry and gave up (I know, I'm sorry fromsofties). This game, however has taken over my brain. I have played 55 hours, I am apparently only about halfway through... How? Idk but I'm happy about it. 
It feels neverending, I have gone back and forth from starting game to mid game areas and feel like I am constantly finding little secrets, pathways, TREASURES. It's great, the world building incredible. 
I dont even find the 'frustrating' parts of this game that bad, its so easy to level up or upgrade weapons that anytime i find myself at a 'roadblock' I can fast travel somewhere, get better gear, level up and try again. 

I cannot sing enough praise for this game. Its incredible, even to a non fromsoftie, although i hope i can one day join the ranks. 

[h1] "Brave Tarnished, thy strength befits a crown." [/h1]

 I cannot explain the amount of love i have for this game, its genuinely the best thing I have ever played.
when i first started playing i thought it was too hard and then quit for a couple of months, after that i started playing and now I have beat the game 4 times and i am planning on doing more playthroughs (and challenge runs). 

  now to the actual review  


    [h2] Gameplay: 10/10. the gameplay is so fun and it feels awesome when you successfully dodge a combo. [/h2]

  [h2]  Direct story: 6/10. the story by its self is ok,its pretty basic but... [/h2]

   [h2] Lore: 10/10. when you take time to look into the lore the story is one of the best game stories oat imo [/h2]

   [h2] Bosses: 8/10. i love the remembrance bosses and some of the great enemy's but alot of the bosses are repetitive. [/h2]


 [h2] open world: 10/10. the open world is beautiful, not much else to say. [/h2]


 [h2] dungeons: 7/10. i love the main dungeons but heros graves are the absolute worst and catacombs all have the same bosses. [/h2]

 [h2] endings: 8/10. [/h2]
 
 Age of the stars 9/10

 Lord of Frenzied Flame 10/10

 default ending 6/10

 Fia ending 7/10

 Goldmask ending 7/10

 Dung Eater ending 8/10
 
 
 [h1] thats the end of my review, bye bye. [/h1]
Great game, makes BOTW and TOTK look like a sad joke. Basically is a open world Dark Souls 3.
cool game
it good xxx
it good
fingers, O fingers
so to speak likely love
The only down side is the 60fps cap. Why do i need to install mods to fix that in 2024?

i love this shit
worth it and so excited for elden ring 2 in dlc
El mejor juego souls
good
zinx scammed me!
women
best game ever.
Game of the fucking century
To my surprise the ring is in fact elden
LOVED all the other souls games, this one just kinda sux. Very boring couldn't stop falling asleep mid boss fight
One of the best games I've ever played.
real
Best game ever
broke 2 mouses and a monitor
GOOD GAME
Games aight
very sigma adnd yeah
mi amor
I'm not gonna lie I was very apprehensive at spending this much on one game, and I've barely played any games like elden ring but i have really enjoyed it so far and would highly recommend it.
Game is too difficult. Game play is frustrating and not enjoyable. Death happens too often. The fall deaths are too frequent causing enraging repetition. Everything about this game is too complicated requires too much time for most people to ever learn to enjoy it. The last time I checked here on steam only about 8% of players completed this lousy mess of a game. I have played for over 6000 hours. You don't get better enough to enjoy this game. To me death represents failure. If you can't play without dying over and over you have failed to win.
meh
fun, plain fun
solid
Empty open world
definitely didnt take me this long to beat margaret the fallen drink but im having loads of fun
I like
Its FromSoft, need i say more? 
Its not Ubisoft, EA, Blizzard, Activision, Bethesda, or any other bloated AAA game company. So its actually a quality game that doesnt take over 100gb and is bigger then most games from those companies.
O, you don't have the right. O, you don't have the right!
This game is overpriced piece of trash,
PC controls suck, half the controls are not in the keybindings or anywhere to be found, need to resort to google,

Co-op is a joke, can't use mounts in a pointlessly large open world area, finding out how to summon/see signs once again requires google because developers are dumb and lazy,
Once you figure out how to summon your friend, you can't go more than 5 minutes of gameplay before getting invaded by a max level player who kills you in 1 hit compared to you needing ~12 hits,
Fighting is not an option, nor is running away because these brain rotted max level players will chase fresh characters for 30mins+ if they need to.
No pvp scaling or matchmaking at all, you will simply get stat diffed if your character is not maxed.

Not to mention the fact that you can't enter any dungeons or side areas in co-op because there's a fog that won't let you enter.

This game is a joke and I don't recommend anyone buying/playing unless you want a completly solo experience as you can't progress in co-op without a max lvl friend.

tldr : Trash game, trash player base, trash game design
One of the hardest games out there but also one of the best and most fun(Dont pick bandit to start tho)

RAGHGRRRRRRRRRRRRR

I heard lots of great things about this game. Then I payed it. The game did nothing to pull me into a story. Did very little to tell you what you were supposed to be doing. Then it starts you in an area where you encounter enemies way above your level, and gives you no clue what to do. When you figure out something you think you are supposed to be doing, giant monsters or groups of wolves drop out from the sky that instakill you.

If you are a Masochist who enjoys being tormented by games and feeling enraged for no reason, this is your game! If you prefer an enjoyable experience with a story you can enjoy and care about seeing to completion, this is not the game for you.

If you enjoy boss fights that appartently (I won't ever play this anymore) take 100+ attempts to beat, only in service of a story no one cares about, this is the game for you. If you prefer a challenge that can be done in a few attempts so that you can advance a story that has captivated you, search elsewhere.

This is the biggest let down of a game I can recall.
I havent even finished the game
Amazing
The true Elden Ring was the friends we made along the way.
I bet I put in 60hrs on the PS4 version.  Now that im rebuilding my library on PC and the expansion is coming out I figured Id repurchase and dig back in.  Now im not a souls fan as I dont like difficult games however Elden Ring scratched the itch I wish more souls games were like and that is only as hard as you make it.  What I liked about Elden Ring is that if you got to a point that was too difficult you could go explore somewhere else and level up as its open world.  You could also summon a random person to help you out.  Was the game fun though?  I wrestled with this question unlike any other game.  When I booted the game up for the first time on PC that music gave me this sick feeling like a drug addict looking at that favorite vise.  Im not sure I ever really like the game but the grind is just addictive.... so here I am 3hrs in and cant put it down.
I don't enjoy suffering, but I liked the open-world genre where you have to discover it yourself.
‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏°‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏î‡∏µ
It is not a good game.

The world might be interesting, but the game is boring, there is no motivation to keep you going through the story, maybe the NPC have fleshed out backstories, they are just presented in a poor way, leaving them all to feel boring. 
They move around the map alot so you never know where to find them, and they dont give hints to quest. I dont know if they think its cool or innovating to not give you pointers for quests, but there is a reason it went out of fashion. 
If you ever looked anything up on Google because they game didnt make it apparent, its bad game design.

I would suffer through the difficult bosses if I actually cared about what happens next, but I dont, so I won't. 

I own most From games, but I think this was my last one. 

To anyone considering buying, you have to have loved all the other Souls games to enjoy this one, its not different, its not better, in some cases its even worse.
10/10
idk
It's not fun when watching it, but fun when playing it. BECOME THE ELDEN LORD
Best experience
The game teaches patience and anger management
i am writing this review after refunding the game and spending the money on something else, biggest mistake i ever made, please kill me

i suck ass but its so much fun

The co-op experience is extremely poorly made and overly tedious with it being limited to only so many tries (god knows what crooked donkey made that a feature). The early game putting you against cheese invade builds meant to abuse low levels which is awesome although more of an issue of its own. Just overall the co op experience sucks not sure why you can only buy a limited amount of tries to summon your duo or why on gods green earth there is not a less buggy and messy system to begin with just give me a danmed lobby and let me play with my duo whats with those restrictions it makes it more tedious its not a gameplay feature. Same cancer youd have to deal with on the other dark souls titles its just borderline garbage.
:3
made me tarnish my pants
It's great but a little easy.  I don't think I even died once besides fall damage or enemies.

Needs AT LEAST 2 more poison swamps.  Maybe a sleep swamp full of enemies with grab attacks?

Nice game
Finally found the albinauric woman. 10/10 would do again

Started as a naked man with a big stick, ended up killing god. Peak Jrpg.

I've always got a lot to say about open world games, mostly about how they're not all that fun when you get down to the copy-paste content, and while Elden Ring was still guilty of some of that‚Äîseveral reused bosses and dungeons‚Äîthey achieved something special in how they went about it. There was no visible checklist of the usual bloat, in fact, there were no arrows pointing the direction to go, no hand-holding other than a quick and optional tutorial. The emphasis was on exploration, encouraging the player to discover whatever they could find.
It ate up my time, that‚Äôs for sure. It was also my first Fromsoft title and I think it was the best possible introduction. I racked up over a hundred hours with a mage build. Sure, there were some frustrations with difficult bosses, but that was a part of the package.
good sh*t
Amazing game

By far the best freaking game ever made.... I've legit played this game easily over 400 hours + from my PS5 to my PC.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Great Game
gotyay what else can you say
I love Melina so much its unreal, I wish there was an ending where I could marry her and be happy ever after
whats not to love? its great gameplay good enemies great spells and mechanics its just perfect
The only thing that I liked in this game was the variety of weapons and armors and two map places (snow area and Liurnia). The bosses are all repetitive, fast attack spams, undodgeable attacks, even the movesets look very similar. The boss designs are all meh, the only boss designs that I liked were Maliketh and Radagon, and the only boss that I liked to fight was grave warden duelist, all other fights were mid just because they were all so similar, the game did not offer anything new. After defeating Morgott the game got super stale and boring, mainly because all the bosses again were so similar and bs and that's why I just couldn't finish the game (I only needed to kill Radagon and Malenia). Yes I could kill Malenia and Radagon, but I don't see the point in continuing the game when I absolutely do not want to play it anymore. Also it's funny how Malenia has all the bs to kill you, healing after every successful hit, undodgeable aoe attack, second phase with full hp and more aggressiveness, for a side boss this should be illegal even the last boss is easier than Malenia. So yeah Idk what the devs were smoking when they made this game, it's absolutely overhyped and it's nowhere good to the previous games. I actually would not recommend to play this for a new player, just play dark souls 3 first and then try other fromsoftware games because this game could absolutely ruin the experience of souls games like it did for my friend. 5.5/10
schizo hidden walls simulator
MASTERPIECE!!!!
Though people think this game is terrible, and in the past I was one of them, coming into it, I realised how great the challenges this game holds. I have friends who played the game before and really enjoy it, so I thought why not give it a try. They guided me through the game and it made me realise how massive and challenging it really is. Other than other game spoon feeding you to get better, this game just gives you an objective: to explore to finding your way through it, well that to me is a fantastic and unique idea, and more games should do this.

Played 140 hours and had a small error that said save data corrupted cause my whole character to be deleted, fix your game if you're going to have people invest time in it
 yeah its epic
Just got into the soulslike genre recently with DS3, so not a veteran by all means.
I like elden ring very much, it's easier then DS3. World and cinematography are amazing.
Definite buy
great game
The best
Here‚Äôs what happened:

I first entered the game and died on the first boss about 10 times, but it was alright then.
After that, I looked up some guides online and came back knowing how to summon a teammate for help, and that‚Äôs when the nightmare started.

Following the guide, I summoned a teammate, but then a red player appeared too and killed us instantly while we were fighting the first boss. The player‚Äôs damage was even higher than the boss's, which I don‚Äôt think is normal.
I gave it another try, but the teammate got killed by the boss within the first half minute. I managed to solo the boss for the remaining 70% health but still ended up dying.
Then, on my third try, I summoned two teammates. Everything was going smoothly until my screen froze and the game crashed. Yeah, thanks for letting me know my 4080 can‚Äôt handle a game from 2022.
When I logged back in, it told me my save file was corrupted and I needed to start all over again.

I don‚Äôt freaking care how good or exciting the next 100 hours are supposed to be. But if the PvP system is messed up, a 4080 plus 64GB of RAM can‚Äôt handle crashes, and there are no darn save file backups, I‚Äôm not recommending this game to anyone. 
Plain and simple.
If you think this game is not for you, try it. It changed my mind!
yes
good game
I mean, Steam, deary, what do you want me to say that hasn't already been said?
map is large, lots of cool content and bosses. If you like hard games, this will one of your top picks.

I don't know what really to say here... I kept getting demolished by the first boss for the first 50 hours. I am now at the capital outskirts, and I think I finally get it. I saw the Erdtree over Leyndell and I just sat there for about 10 minutes admiring the sight before me. It reminded me of my first time through Dark Souls getting to Anor Londo 10 years ago. The frustration and anger and the persistence and time spent to prevail up to that point. I realize now that I wasn't playing Elden Ring to play Elden Ring. I was playing Elden Ring to reestablish my gaming roots and rejuvenate the genuine sense of joy they're supposed to bring. The game is horribly difficult but I haven't raged at it since I beat Margit. 10/10 will continue to play.
it made me buy sekiro, ds1, ds2, and I will buy ds3

this game is absolute garbage, have a controller plugged in, doesnt show anything but keyboard inputs, cant kill anything in your first go, if youve never played this, dont, anyone who says its great has sunken cost fallacy
:D
gooda
have never been into souls like games so never thought i would like this title . A dude at work talked me into playing Elden Ring and wow this is one of the best games i've ever played. Amazing.
Spaghetti code. Even with RTX3070ti this game still crashes EVERYTIME i play. Crazy that the crashes only happen in this game and its sister game "Dark Souls", while my other game runs normally.


While it can be a very hard game its open world and great graphics make it pretty damn good. I would definetly  recommend if your looking for a challenge and want a medieval style game.
" I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella"

easily one of the worst games ive ever played. if you are thinking about buying this game, don't.  i'm warning you. 

10/10 game, must try.
Good game i guess, what with this game locking at 60fps though
You know when ubisoft devs throw shade at you that you made a great game
yes
THIS GAME!
ABSOULTELY A MASTERPIECE!

Basically... Zelda Breath Of The Wild meets Darksouls

Tip: Do not run trough this game! Take your time and it rewards you.
Best game where getting lost is part of the design.
maybe the best game ever made, only held back by 1) terrible UI & mouse/keyboard implementation, and 2) lack of native & seemless coop so you can play it with friends. Everything else is glorious.

¬¥Technically terrible game. 
- Graphics are terrible. Yet fps are terrible as well for that graphics.
- 60 fps cap. Fucking bullshit.
- No Ultrawide support. Fucking bullshit again.
- I have a stutter every 30 mins or so and I have one of the best possible pc. 
- You can't compare your gear with the gear you want to purchase from a merchant. I mean, really? Even a fucking moron who played a rpg for 5 mins would implement that feature. 

I can write more but even this is a fucking waste of time for this game.

Edit:
- They used the same mobs and bosses over and over again.
- The different regions of the game doesn't feel like a different and unique region most of the time. 
- The open world is big but dead in the same time. It doesn't excite me to explore this open world cause I face the same mobs over and over again.
- Dungeons are copy paste. They are not unique again. Even the bosses in those dungeons are reused bosses all the time.
- Story telling is non-existent. This is always the case with From Software but it's a huge negative point of the game. 
- The bosses are not exciting to fight at all. Their design is not good. 
- I am bored after 30 hours or so but tried to finish the game. I have explored every region and killed almost every boss but the last 2-3. If I find any motivation to kill those, I will finish the game and play the dlc to see how it is. 

Maybe the DLC will bring some refreshment to the game but I am doubtful about it. Base game is not a good game at all. It is kinda Ubisoft copy/paste in a souls like game. 

It is a joke that this game got the GOTY award. GoW Raagnar√∂k deserved 10 times more than this game. GoW had an amazing story telling and much more interesting world than this shitty world. 

This game is one of the most overrated product/game that I used/played. This is not a better game than last Assassin's Creed games.
Best game of my life so far
SHE HAS HOW MANY HANDS??!!
this game is just a poor copy of deepwoken, due to deepwoken's greatness that it poorly copied it still manages to get a thumbs up from me, i love deepwoken thanks ragoozer stop co developing type soul hitboxes.
Pretty good game. Fell in love. Got my ass destroyed. Got to set stuff on fire. 
Dung Eater sucks.

Pretty good game 11/10
Ranni be mine
One of the greatest games of all time. When you die 20 times in 5 minutes, keep going. It is worth every bit of suffering. Become the Elden Lord.
Pretty dope, super punishing, there's like a full second between me hitting the button and my character dodging

60 FPS lock? wtf
i think its ok
This game triggers my anger sometimes when I get stuck or so but otherwise it's pure perfection. I def recommend to play it with friends in co-op, because experiencing it together adds a special spark to the adventure.
Good game 7/10 dlc might make it an 8

spent more time dying than playing the game. 10/10 will buy DLC after i finish this game
stupid. only way i can describe this game

My walls started cosplaying swiss cheese!
Absolutely addicted to this game. Always end up losing track of time while grinding the main story, hunting down armor/weapons, and completing side quests.
The most beautiful and challenging game. Take your time and get lost in the Lands Between. Rise, Tarnished.
Peak of souls.
W game
It's Elden ring, what more do i gotta say? One of Fromsoft's finest games.
W game(hard tho)
NO PLIN PLIN PLON !!!!!
there is no better game than this absolute masterpiece, the entire time i have played this game i have had a constant headache from how hard my johnson was from the game-play and how beautiful this game is, i would sell both of my barely functional  testicles to experience this game for the first time again, i am and will forever be this games biggest meat rider,
one of the most incredible games I've played
best game of all time
It's no Dark Souls II but it's playable
destroyed my desk and moniter fighting first boss
I've never played a Souls-like before, so the first 2 times I'd tried to pick this up after release were a bit painful. I watched an Hbomberguy video on the topic though and he described it being like a rhythm game more than anything else, and ever since then the combat loop has just clicked and it's a ton of fun. The world is so engaging and vast, while still feeling deep too. The hype is very real, and Godric is a total son of a bitch.

Good luck.
This really Eldened my Ring.

10/10
fuck this game fuck godskin duo
best souls game for beginners, its the easiest of the souls games, elden ring provides a difficult setting via thew choices of builds, summons, ashes of war, jump button, buffing spells and third flask that can be edited to make bosses easier 8/10
Could this be a  review
Praise the review

So the game is capped at 60fps. and with a 4070ti and i5 13th gen i cant run stable 60fps on high graphics. The game was nice but the optimisation is terribl.

Empty violence in a vast & spectacular environment. Lack of NPCs or meaningful interaction leaves me cold.

The best FromSoft game easy, which is saying something.
This game is THE dark fantasy exploration and fighting game. It has the atmosphere, the mechanics, the bosses, and the lore. I could be glazing this but idc. This is most likely the best game EVER made so far along with other bangers like Balders Gate. If you have the money and the time, give this game a try! And don't be afraid that it is difficult, because yes it is, but it doesn't take long until you get the hang of it. Heck this was my first Souls game and I beat it.
I just beat the final boss God Rick.  Edit: holy crap
i have maidens i swear
This is, without question, the greatest game of all time.
solid fromsoft game, i really like the part where i swing the sword and it hits the bad guys

OOOOHHHHH ELDEN RING
could this be a [strike] dog [/strike]  masterpiece?
First game I have refunded in my steam carrier. Reasons:
Does not properly "support" ultra wide screen (3440x1440)
Not a controller player - felt a bit clunky (was known in advance but together with the other drawbacks its another reason for the refund)
a Fix (Flawless fullscreen) needs to be implemented to play it on ultra wide without black borders
Takes you out of immersion if you use flawless - added bars to the side are not integrated in loading screens/cutscenes
On 20 pulls vs the first enemy, I had 2 game crashes and 2 heavy visual bugsx
sick game 

I mean its elden ring in 2024 still god tier game!
This is my cat. He enjoys laying with me while I play the game so I give the game 10/10 for the experience. Each thumbs up pets my cat.

-------------- The Greatest Game ---------------
good
Yeah... it slaps
Our generation may never see a game like this again... an absolute masterpiece which any living gamer should play and appreciate to have experienced in our lifetime.
Absolutely brilliant but very VERY hard. Only start if you have a LOT of time to waste!
10/10 will always go back and die again

I think I need the same thesaurus used by the localization teams to help me describe the experience these games have given me and so many other players.

This game, however,
Is batshit insane by comparison

I never expected the work of Fromsoft to slowly adapt concepts around pantheons and world mechanics that perfectly correlate so many real-world thematic elements or even sciences. It's a living collage of their previous mythologies. A far more lively version of Dark Souls 3's end of the world in a way. Ages colliding in the same way people would as described by Our First Sun Brother.

This game features:

-soulslike combat + sekiro jump (finally)
                                                    {~030}~
-vast and living (ironically) open world

-a fun collection of armor and elegant weapons

-thematic and explosive magic (crank the effects slider and have fun with mods OFFLINE please)

-That classic stonefaced dialogue exhaustion that'll get ya emotional by the end

-Your own stoneface potentially dropping at the fuckery you are not prepared to witness


"Allegedly"

-what lies behind the Demon Soul's broken archstone

-Yharnam/Ariandel/Lothric survivors

-VELKA

-those tiny flames dancing across the darkness

-Great Ones 

-Light/Time Travel

-more layered world trees and dreams
this game is def the hardest of the souls games that i have played but in a majestic lovely sort of way 10/10 would buy again

It is good
Masterpiece but fuck miyasaki
best game ever 42/5

this game taught me how to git gud

"you cant play this game without knowing what git god means"-my friend
Elden Ring is a fantastic game from beginning to end - from the scenery, story and the boss fights, it's a masterpiece which captivates you with its challenge and story and bosses put you on your toes in a riveting fight. The OST's are incredible from the first to last story boss.
Whilst not necessarily new player friendly with the first main story boss, the game provides open world exploration and discovery to keep you interested about the world and the game itself. Providing many different ways for the player to experience the game; playing mage, light sword or great sword allows for great replayability along with multiple different ways to approach the story and its endings by applying vast story routes.
The world is expansive with a multitude of different areas ranging in difficulty and uniqueness for the player to face which provides a new sense of challenge, along with the boss difficulty. 
For those looking for a challenge or wanting to enter into the world/series of souls-like from Fromsoftware, this would be the game to start with as it's the easiest in the franchise in comparison to games like Dark Souls III, Bloodborne or Sekiro.
In overall, give the game a good go no matter the demotivating factors you will face with constant death. The satisfaction of beating a boss after multiple goes is seriously worth it and you will be able to see why Elden Ring has received world wide acclaim as Game of the Year.
a good game

ah memek lu
very nice
88 hours latter I finally killed the fire giant, and so the game begins
A good game. Lots of fun.
About to start NG+3

This game is a true masterpiece. Just over 200 hours and stilol feel like the game is fresh and new to me. Lots to explore, tons of weapons and spells, and with the new DLC coming, I figured it was time to do my 3rd lap in preparation!
i like it
Its pretty good
lots of finger but hole
...
Foul trespasser.
Game Cooks. :)
BEST game of all time!!!
So addicting
mid

blaidd
GIT GUD
One of y favorite games to date. Bosses feel challenging but fun to fight, making builds is a blast (strength build best build) and the endings are all amazing. Only real complaint is forced PVP if you want to play with a friend, but there are mods to get around that. Over all, 9/10 cant wait for the DLC
Never was a souls fan before i played this game, its really incredible
W GAME
Overrated
Goes hard
Excellent Souls experience!
amazing
Best game for the past and the next decade.
i mean its souls like + open world
Absolute masterpiece. Took me a while to get into it as it's my first fromsoft game, but its so worth the learning curve.
I like this game. I don't like the open world.
Tight-knit, interconnected worlds are what FromSoft are good at making. 
Legacy dungeons and boss fights rule. Regular dungeons and random encounter bosses do not.
Not much needs said.  My favorite game.  Another amazing entry by FromSoftware.
This is a masterpiece even tho i used to hate it cuz it was so easy tbh still so easy not like ds3 when i used to be 4/8 hours on the same boss cuz i wanted to kill him at lvl 10/20 ( end game bosses ),,
the amount of perfection this game has is so crazy good that i switch from strength builds to magic builds just cuz of they look so pretty i was look at the magic spells i use mid boss fight cuz of there beauty, elden ring graphics are so good that its all most Top 1 graphics game that i ever seen ( top 1 is cyberpunk i think we all know why)... do i recommend playing elden ring? 100% YES but if ur not gonna 100% the game don't buy it or don't even buy any souls like game.
Excellent
WWWWWWWWWWWWWW
bloodborne better
if ur anger management is bad, this is the game for u, and rush things it helps defeating the bosses

Elden Ring - A Vast and Enchanting Masterpiece

FromSoftware's "Elden Ring," co-created with George R.R. Martin, offers a breathtaking blend of open-world exploration and challenging gameplay. Set in the expansive Lands Between, players navigate a richly detailed world filled with hidden secrets and formidable enemies. The game combines familiar Dark Souls combat with new mechanics like mounted combat and greater build customization, providing flexible paths to overcome obstacles. The narrative, enriched by Martin‚Äôs lore, is deep and intricate, inviting players to piece together the story. With hauntingly beautiful art direction and an epic score, "Elden Ring" is a monumental achievement in open-world design and gameplay.
well i don't have to say anything...
Game
I usually just play FPS games and nothing more. This game is unlike any game that i have played. I can literally lose my self for hours try to complete one simple task and think that its only been a couple of minutes. Every part of this game is perfect. The visuals, the story, the customization, the lore it self. I makes me feel like how it was playing Fallout 4 for the first time. Losing my self and becoming the story.
Idk man I dont think I would put that much time into this game
Best Game of ALL TIME must play.
And feels like you are in completely different world like actually there.
And acomplishment of beating the BOSS is the BEST.
W Game
the absolute, undisputed, GOAT. Try it. Try try try again and you'l be swept off your feet
awesome
love hate relationship

Schlechteres passing als Dark Souls 2. Boss designs sind generic und viel schlechter als Dark Souls 3. World building ist arguably schlechter als Dark Souls 1. Einzige coole sind die neuen Waffen move sets und Kombination an Builds. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª

I want to cry... But I am having fun I swear
why is godman made of pee :(
I got this game a year after release. I have dever played any Dark Souls Games. I was curious to try Elden Ring.

It is one of the Best Games of all time. I was surprised. Art is good. Story is good. Combat is good.

I love this game. I still play it. Multiple reruns. All achievements. And I still play it.

It also runs great on the Steam Deck. A good pair of headphones and the Steam Deck are awsome on a plane ride!!!
Maiden feet
A Masterpiece !
I HATE MY LIFE!
Hardest game I have ever played (new to souls games) but it is worth it üòä So beautiful ü§©
balls
:)
lobster not fun
thyself shall play this game
I didn‚Äôt expect to play Elden Ring for 140 hrs like this. FromSoftware‚Äôs games aren‚Äôt my type of game, especially since I‚Äôm 45 now and have little time to play a game, so when I play the game, I expect fun, and relaxation, with some challenge. I love games like Mass Effect Trilogy and CyberPunk 2077, I played ‚Äúsoft soul-like‚Äù like Star Wars Jedi games but didn‚Äôt expect to like Elden Ring. 

For me, it‚Äôs not a perfect game, and it has runes to grind like a typical JRPG game but I like the world, I like the game‚Äôs mechanics. It‚Äôs not like Dark Souls or Sekiro or any soul-like games. It has ‚Äúhope‚Äù. If I fight with the boss and die for hunred times? Just get out of the boss area and do something else, find new talismans, find new sorceries, find new armor and weapons, find new crystal tears, do other side-quests, etc.

Admit that I am annoyed with the quest‚Äôs mechanics, I know that the dev wants players to explore, and they trust us to do it, I understand but am still annoyed.  

In the end, I enjoyed my time. It‚Äôs a very unique, creatively interesting game. I‚Äôm not a fan of your games but I respect you, Miyazaki-san.

Ooooo Elden ring!
Best RPG I've ever played.
IT IS AMAZING ABSOLUTE CINEMA

This is my first Souls-like game. My first death was me listening to a message saying "You must jump to progress." I thought all messages were part of the game.

Controls are strange at first but other than that, everything about this game is beautifully done. If you haven't played a souls game yet I recommend playing the prior games first since the Quality of Life upgrades that come with Elden ring make it hard to go backwards.
This game is pretty good, i have some complaints like for example that the farming of runes gets repetitive after a while and once you discover all the maps the open world doesen't feel so open anymore, at least for me. Finding the bosses you need to defeat is also pretty hard as the only thing indicating where you need to go are the rays from lost graces, it doesen't help that the NPCs speak in riddles, may not be a problem if english is your first language. The combat is awesome, it feels great and it's smooth, some enemies make me want to bash my head against a wall though. Overall i think i would give it a solid 7/10. If this isn't your first time playing a souls game i would wait until a discount.

This is a very good starting game, it is very easy, the game helps you with a lot throughout the story so you never get stuck. The map is not too complicated and the combat system is very simple. If you want to start with a game that is not to hard to beat but is still enjoyable this is what I would recommend. In addition, I personally find this game very relaxing, I have never raged on this game even though I do often with some other titles.
Good
ELDEN RING
Good game
The best open world game ever
I opened a treasure chest and the treasure was an all-expenses-paid trip to super-hell. I then proceeded to kill super-hell and fought a deranged warrior demigod who held the stars at bay, after two years I beat him only to discover that the stars were gravity-demons, I then found and repaired a medallion that unlocked super-duper-hell on ice, fought a blood-wielding pedophile and then made my through a fucked up tree and got one-hit-killed by gaming's most powerful cripple until I gave up. still haven't fought WWE grandpa yet.
Not fun unless you upgrade strength only, 10/10 masterpiece, also free hugs
I gotta tell ya. It was perfect. PERFECT. Everything. down to the last minute details.
As per usual, amazing game, only huge - just like with Dark Souls but not in Nioh is the fact you can't just fight those bosses instantly after, like an option in mods where you can just respawn bosses.
gud
NIHIL NIHIL NIHIL
The controls are smooth and the scenery is great. I have a slight worry that I might get addicted.
I cant stop playing this game. Send help!
I closed out the game correctly and it just corruption my save fata
omg im the grim reaper
It's not the falling that determines your character, it's the choice to step back up again and again upon falling down.
I love buttered sausage, this game is W

worst fucking game ever, 40 bucks for me to get a sword shoved up my ass and raped. Ive screamed mean words an uncountable amount of times because of this horrible game, its more of a chore to play this game, and if u quit u have a evil voice in the back of your head saying "skill issue" which makes you want to come back for more. Its like an ex boyfriend with a big dick, you leave him because he beats you, then you come back for his  cock. THEN HE BEATS YOU, but its fun.

An amazing expanding open world to explore, great story, variety of weapons and playstyles, plenty of boss fights. secrets, side areas. There is plenty of fun to be had, as well as conniptions.

If you want to devote your life to a game, buy this game. It is super super challenging if you like those types of games but it is not impossible. So it challenging, whilst being super fun and enjoyable as well. I like that I can play this when I am trying to chill and be relaxed
GAME IS PEAK, really hard!

Release Bloodborne port
   Let me preface this by saying this game is not for everyone. In fact, in the beginning it wasn't for me. Like most people who bought Elden Ring. this was basically my first souls-like (I dabbled in ds3). Having said that, this is one of the best games I have ever played. Having bought this when i was 17, I had no idea what i was getting into. I poured all I had into this game. I am now 19 and this game is honestly breathtaking, it's everything I love, it's what got me into berserk, it helped shape me. And for that, I am eternally grateful.

This game is incredible. The sheer size of everything is probably the best part. The work that the developers put in to the game is beautiful. Recommend 100%, and all the more if you started from Dark Souls, like I did.
awesome sauce!
I have at least 1 hour in this game and i think its cool :]
2nd best souls game
YES YES YES YESY YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Elden ring made me feel like a god and a peasent simutanously

its fine
Actually the worst game ever created. Boo Men >>>>>>>>>> Elden ring

May chaos take the world 10/10
Have played this on all systems this has been relased for and it is one of my modern favorites !
Live, Die, Repeat.
One of the best games of 21st century so far. Takes a bit of time to get used to, adopt and get a the idea and joy from the game, however if you haven't played it - it is a MUST. Hard but the joy it brings with all the combat, environments, character, masterful design, script and "spoiler alert" emotions - 100/100
BAAAAANGER
thank you miyazaki for this masterpiece of a game, godskin trio when???
yes
fun
I like mounting my stalion

initially got this game early 2023, got my ass wiped in stormveil (had no clue what i was doing), and didnt touch it again after the fact. after giving it another chance in preparation for the new dlc coming out soon, i can definitely say that this is currently one of my top 10 games of all time
game is dog

Elden ring randomizer mod is a must for people that want a challenge.
it just works
this game makes me coom buckets
This high level of challenge can be daunting, but it makes every victory incredibly satisfying. Visually, Elden Ring is stunning, with intricate environments and breathtaking landscapes. The open-world design allows exploration at your own pace, revealing secrets and lore that add depth to the experience.
eldlen ring dung eaterrrrr
worst game ive played
mmmmmmh
If you like being so mad not even rage quiting helps with the anger, then this is the game with you. 

Definitally not for the faint hearted. It's a difficult game, but the challange is what makes it so good! Make sure you have someone with a little knowledge of the game with you while you play, just so you know a little bit of what to do, or else it's going to be so confusing. 

Would recomend also playing on controller as there are so many different things you need to do that Keyboard and mouse makes it harder for you to get everything down. ( Play style, abilities etc )

All in all Elden ring is a fun and enjoyable game, takes hours of your time, and can cause some funny rage induced moments! Would recomend the buy
Behold, The Elden Ring! And now, wait for The Shadow Of The Erdtree
The most polished Souls game to date. Deep and detailed gameplay mechanics, the game will be challenging no matter playstyle you develop, and it allows a lot of those.

Expertly crafted Open World that greatly rewards curiosity and exploration and properly defies and also awes you, this is the best Open World experience in a video game to date, well placed and well timed events, secrets, hidden paths, new exciting enemies at every corner, and a lot of unique twists to its design.

Well developed and memorable NPCs, with awesome story arcs and a few emotional ones.

Main NPCs and the world has great and deep lore in the bit and pieces and environmental storytelling way that we always loved about the series. And of course the community around the game is amazing, from Fextralife to VaatiVidya and random sun bros you encounter on your journey online for jolly cooperation or fierce ivasions.

Until the moment I write this review, this is the best video game I have ever played. Period. And I have a few decades of video game playing.

If you love the Souls series you have to play Elden Ring, you have to. This is a unique experience and a work of art, it builds on top of everything FromSoftware created until now, clearly a labor of love from them.

This is FromSoftware's Magnum Opus.
There is SO MUCH CONTENT. You could play this game for 100 hours and not find everything (and I have...multiple times...). This game has depth and breadth like none other.
This game has already cost me 2 controllers and they plan to release a DLC? 

Excellent.
Buy it.

Pretty good game. Don't rob yourself of the PvP experience by using seamless mod though.
Hark! Lend thine ear to mine humble recount of an adventure most wondrous, known to the common folk as Elden Ring. 'Tis a tale of high valor, perilous quests, and a realm wrought with eldritch magicks and formidable beasts.

Upon mine first ingress into the Lands Betwixt, I, a humble knight sworn to the chivalric code, found myself ensorcelled by the vastness of this uncharted domain. The world sprawleth before mine eyes, rich in verdant fields, shadowed woods, and ancient ruins, each beckoning with secrets untold and dangers unforeseen. The very air hummeth with the whispers of bygone eras, and the stars themselves seem to chart the destiny of those brave enough to seek the Elden Ring.

The combat, verily, doth honor the skill of a knight. Each clash of steel upon steel ringeth true, demanding precision and valor. The foes one doth encounter, from lowly beasts to towering giants, are as cunning as they are fierce. Yet, with sword and shield, and the strength of thine arm, victory is attainable, though hard-won. The mastery of arms and the keen mind to study one's enemy art paramount to success.

Elders of this realm spake of mighty lords and ladies, once noble, now twisted by corruption. These formidable adversaries require not only brawn but the wit to unravel their mysteries and discern their weaknesses. Each encounter with these dread beings is a saga unto itself, etched in the annals of thine memory.

The lands are replete with sights to behold: castles towering against the azure sky, caverns deep and dark, where light doth fear to tread, and ethereal landscapes that stir the soul. The artistry of these environs is such that one might linger long in contemplation, were it not for the pressing duty to restore order and reclaim the Elden Ring.

Yet, not all is strife and battle. There be sanctuaries wherein one might find respite, commune with fellow wayfarers, and hone their skills. The camaraderie found in such moments is a balm to the weary heart and a reminder of the bonds that tie all who walk this perilous path.

In sooth, Elden Ring is a saga of grand proportions, a testament to the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of glory. To any knight, squire, or seeker of fortune, I commend this journey. Brace thyself, steel thy heart, and mayhap thou shalt emerge, not unscathed, but victorious, with tales to last a lifetime.

Godspeed, noble adventurer.
good game

The good stuff
Insanely fun!! I've only played a bit of Bloodborne on PS before this, so it was a learning curve to be sure. But when you've finally beaten the boss you've died to several hundred times, it's worth it. The story is pretty great, the sound design, stage designs, everything wrapped together makes this highly worth it.
Even if you don't play souls games, you should give this a chance
It is the easiest and probably the best souls like that has ever been made

The second best game of from, a must have.
and a surprising easy game to platinum (compared to ds1 and ds3)

This game is veary good but the start of the game can be ruf.
Honestly, one of the best experiences I have had since I was a kid. It checked so many boxes. Not many games these days make me lose sleep because I look forward to playing.
Good, but not great

I loved Dark souls series and Dark Souls will always have special place for me, but I can¬¥t quite place it but I don¬¥t like Elden Ring. Something that made Dark souls special for me is missing in Elden Ring
You gotta just blast 'em.
Best game of all time

Fun and challenging, Miyazaki cooking as usual. DLC about to be godhood ascension-type material.

Yeah I guess its pretty good.
I am very amazed by the beauty in the game like the face of an angel

very nice
Walking simulator with not enough content the map is visually stunning and massive but for the scale of thew world most of the enemies are only in the main content areas meaning you just end up walking/riding a mount for 20-30 minutes at a time with nothing but scenery out of the souls like games ive played this by far was the most boring to me the bosses was alright but alot of them follow the same pattern hit you with a 20 hit combo then jump/teleport 20ft away straight away making the fights also feel less engaging than other souls like game i know they have a dlc coming out soon which i will try but overall for the hype this game gets its very underwhelming not to mention if u don't complete the game a certain way the community (bare fist no armour) they will just ridicule your achievement overall 5/10 and the 5 comes from the visuals and cinematics but the game itself is a snoozefest add some more npcs and mobs at least.

One of the best games of all time!
The best game i ever played
Best game ever
Nothing could ever be better than Elden Ring.
completely destroyed my life. good.
:P
Not much to say about this game other than it is one of a kind experience in the fantasy RPG genre. I gave a thumbs up to all previous FromSoft games. Of course this one would also deserve a thumbs up from me...

love this
its good
best game ever
just play it
nice relaxing games to play after work for a few hours
Literally cant play cause the devs don't understand how to fix a game that's been out for years to stop stuttering every 20 seconds.... Idiot devs should be fired, Stuttering has been in SINCE lunch and the idiots can't fix it..
Masterpiece.  Long live FromSoft, the last company that makes video games.
Best game of the era, but Malenia's healing effect is much more imba!
Great game
Car salesman: *Slaps roof of Elden Ring* You can fit at least 4 poison swamps in this bad boy.

On a more serious note, Elden Ring was an absolute joy to play, especially if you're a Souls veteran. The game is essentially Dark Souls 4 with an open world map, and so many quality of life features that were completely missing in previous games. Summons and Ashes of War are great additions to the game, allowing players tons of flexibility both in playstyle and in difficulty. If you've never played a Souls game because it's too hard, this is the place to start. If you're a Souls veteran... What are you even doing here? Just go play the game.
They can win as many times as they like, I only need to win ONCE.
Very fun game with a lot of character and honestly if you like hard games you will enjoy this one!!

A game full of fantasy horror and a plethora of possibilities open to the player. It's enjoyable, and it's frustrating. It's a true soulslike experience. And it's, in it's own cruel way, lovely
take you to another world

Good game but too easy

good game
top tier
Just buy it

Each NPC and boss have their own stories behind them. The deeper I delve into each questline, the more I understand why some NPCs and enemies have hostile attitudes towards each other or why they hide in different dungeons and areas. The world in Elden Ring doesn't just revolve around the player's story, many events occur simultaneously and they will continue to happen regardless of what you do in numerous ways. After all, it's the best Souls game by FromSoftware they have ever made!
One of the most incredible games I have ever played, although I wish the multiplayer was a bit better...
best game ever
very `nice
Awful
Can't play this, no change to move a bit forward instantly killed
After having this game sit in my library for some time i decided to finally delve into Elden Ring. It's not hyperbolic to say that this is probably one of the most masterfully crafted games of all time. Everything about this game is amazing and its really easy to sink dozens of hours into the game without realizing it (like me lol).
"Didn't expect strong foe"
it's good
Very fun :)))))))))))))))))))
Quite possibly the most beautiful of the soulsborns. Absolutely huge and breathtaking world.
game have dog, game good
great open world, strong bosses, what more could you ask for?
Fuck You Miyazaki
Its like Dark Souls mixed with breath of the wild
yes|\]
Amazing
Maybe the best game I gave ever played
just number 1
.
peak tbh recommend searching up a few tutorials from the start and just explore everywhere and see what u can find and search up what u can do with certain items and such
Yes
That's just how games are made. game of the years!!
Alright game, bit short
REALLY REALLY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!
Extremely addictive and very difficult. My first souls game and all you do for the first hours is run on the horse to collect the runes you dropped when you last died :P
This is the game I have replayed the most. Being a souls fan, this game is a dream come true

Game of the year
great game, my wife left me after i yelled "forefathers, one and all BEAR WITNESS!" before i put it in and then she took the kids and left but at least i have this game.
one of the better games out there
I did not play this correctly, I dodged attacks.
Broke a few controllers because of this game so I bought 10 for the new DLC, hopefully that's enough.
Near perfection in a Game
The only thing lacking is, you often dont know what to do
Amazing game! Hard but fun, and plenty of content.
A challenging action-adventure open world game. Enjoyable, but frustrating at times. Just gotta keep at it.
The game is sigma male
ye
it this dog?

Beautiful game! Well done!
One little thing i would add to this game: Transmog - Some armor sets look cool i dont even want to change them when i get something better.
Pickle
Painfully Amazing :)
This is the best soulsborne game I have ever played: better than Dark Souls and Dark Souls III. In terms of what this game does right, I could write a novel. Instead, I will write on it's only flaws. The storytelling is dogshit, the game could do with more weapons, a few of the bosses are bs, and the game could be more clear in what you're meant to do sometimes.

That's it. Those are the only flaws. In every other possible category, metric, what have you, the game is p e r f e c t. 

This is, imo, the 10th best game I have ever played. In terms of artistic merit, it is THE best.

9/10. A stunning achievement.

Don't know why it took me so long to write a review, Have beat the game 3 times now through NG+ 1st run through basically doing everything, Amazing game, Worth every penny and is so reasonably priced in this age of games, 129.99 for the new Assassins creed game is crazy, From software definitely deserve every penny made from this game, people have moaned about DLC costing too much but bro ¬£34.99 for Elden Ring DLC is so reasonable legit, The base game alone is worth far more than ¬£50, It's like BG3 for me, I am happy to spend the money, 0 regrets, GOTY, First souls game I played, Amazing game! buy it, support them! they deserve the money more than most companies
This is an excellent game but not for the faint of heart. Please understand that dying over and over again is an important part of the game. It will help you to grow in skill, learn attacks from enemies and learn fight your desire to give up. I recommend that you play this game without outside noise (No music, podcasts or other distracting mediums). Please don't play this game if you have assessments, jobs, or other things to do. Don't play for too long (2 hours max) per day as this is a long game an is best enjoyed over a long period of time.
Great Game
fun game
IT GUD
Good game but don't forget the joker
Best Game I've ever played.
chefs kiss
Oh jeez, it's astonishing. Challenging sometimes but not in a boring way and really rewarding.
nice game
amazing
I love this game for the intense legendary battles and the open world experience. Ive played other games but the problem was that i was easily distracted and i adapted too quickly allowing me to mow those games. However Elden Ring has proposed a true bag of fine challenge(which needs no easy mode, since you have rivers of blood and other weapons to cheese) while dodging attack after attack until i see a punishable move. I even struggle at the endgame, with all the loot i can possibly obtain. They even have a feature unlike any other, which allows you to go through the entire game again, but with the bosses buffed up for a little more challange (im on my 8th one). Every weapon, including the starter weapons, can defeat all the bosses, which is perfect for elden ring. all in all i recommend this amazing master piece  (just ignore the rivers of blood haters) to anyone who loves a challenge
b
quite possibly the best game ever made
100% the best open world game of all time

absolutely the pinnacle of the souls genre
Lots of game, lots of replayability, lots of rich lore, lots of atmosphere, lots of beauty, lots of builds, lots of enemy variety, lots of secrets, lots of flow, lots of freedom... and best of all: Not much hand holding, markers telling you where to go at every given moment and classic open world formula vibes.

It feels good, ya know?

(I've put over 400 hours on the PS version)
GOTY for a reason

Best open world game EVER created. Exploration is incredible and so much fun. THIS is how an open world game should be done. Fromsoft has yet again, given us something amazing. I don't think it is perfect in the slightest. But there's a reason why it won game of the year. I won't ramble on too much but if you're a fan of the souls games and are contemplating buying Elden RIng... just do it.
its so good
"try fingers"
The story certainly revolves around you vs the United States of a Marika.
I bought this game back in 2022 when it first released for Xbox and I thoroughly enjoyed the frustratingly addictive experience. I put around 30 hours into the game at that time but had never finished it. Now there's an upcoming expansion and I suppose there's no better time than to try and play the game again. Let's see how many hours I put into it this go around...
I killed a incestual blood demon and I'm told ill be entering his little brothers corpse in June. 10/10
this was the best game i have ever played it has a good open map and tons of lore and acually i think there is TOO MUCH STUFF
Good gae
Genuinely brought back my love for gaming. Would totally recommend
its a good'n
I really enjoy this game. But. Its just so vast and complicated that I get lost extremely easy on every level. I get lost when trying to make my build, I get lost in the landscape, and I get lost in the lore. I know that some aspects of this are intentional, but it is still quite frustrating sometimes as a player. 

I enjoyed dark souls 1, and the more linear aspects of that game kept me focused. I think I would like Sekiro 
 and Dark Souls 3 more for that reason. Maybe I just need to play more. When I beat it and do new game+ I will reevaluate. Maybe the DLC will help as well.
If dipping your private parts into a vat of liquid nitrogen and shattering them with a sledge hammer was a game, this would be it.

dark souls but newer
where's the elden ring at?
One of the greatest video games of all time!
ver good
too much fun

Elden Ring isn't just a game, it's an experience that surpasses even the most revered titles in the genre. As someone who has spent countless hours wandering the vast expanse of Skyrim, I can confidently say that Elden Ring has dethroned it as my top game of all time. While Skyrim's world is undeniably immersive, Elden Ring elevates the open-world formula to new heights with its unparalleled depth, challenge, and storytelling.
Bought this on PS5 years ago. Love it so much I had to get it on my Steam Deck too. Immaculate world, combat, bosses, weapons, armour, characters, art direction, story. RPG at its finest.
gg
very entertaining and fun
I love soul games being open world. So we can play this game more often and explore all the maps in this world. I hope for this game there will be a lot of game dlc coming
I don't write reviews at all but I did want to share my experience with Elden Ring/Fromsoft as a whole. This was the first soulslike I picked up after solely playing FPS for many years, and it genuinely raised my standards ridiculously. Every area in the open world feels lived in and packed full of depth, not a single place lacks importance or feels at all like filler. The versatility of your builds, armor, character design, weapons, all of it proves how much care the developers put into crafting such a beautiful experience. I don't play games very often, usually only hopping on with a few friends occasionally, but Elden Ring really caught my attention and re-lit a spark for story-driven single player games. I'm so very excited for the upcoming DLC

I'm not at all a console user but I decided to pick up Bloodborne (the first few hours were just me staring down at the buttons because I had no idea what I was pressing bless my heart) and while the learning curve was HUGE,,, It was one of the best gaming experiences iv'e had. I recently bought DarkSouls 3 on the PS4 as well and I have already fallen in love. I'm so grateful Elden Ring introduced me to so many wonderful projects.

Amazing and honest company, breath-taking art direction, unforgettable games, 11/10
10/10 Perfect game. Best single player experience I've ever had.
fun but hard
The Erdtree beckons me unto it's shadow.
Its wizard time!!!!
AWESOME GAME 

This is the most amazing game ive ever played it is so worth the 90$ that you spend on it. I would recemend.

Elden ring romance dlc when???
It's good.
very very good game i highly recommend playing this game if your looking for a good challenge. I put in a lot of hours into this game. You will have to invest a lot of time and probably die a lot so be prepared. This is one of my favorite games.
malenia can suck my dick
From Software's first modern open world game is quite impressive. I was surprised by how player friendly it is and how it avoids common pitfalls from other games. Yes the bosses are hard but the game gives you so many tools and options to develop there's an effective strategy for everyone. Fast travel is free to checkpoints, you have a horse you can instantly summon, it's agile and easy to control, highly effective in combat, and can double jump. Massive content and bueatiful world with interesting things to see everywhere you go. Respec is easily available and you're never locked into one build.

Worst thing you can say about it is the common Souls problem of your weapons all start at level 0 and require heavy investment to stay current, This makes it really expensive and grindy to change weapons the farther you get into the game.  The enemy variety is great in general but still feels stretched thin, especially with reused bosses in all the side dungeons. Eventually you'll have a set build of weapons and skills and it feels less fun to explore because you just find more weapons you won't use or spells that you don't need, etc.

Still, great fun, amazing game.

love it when an open world game is actually open
game is phenomenal
Can't wait for the DLC
Dying is Fun. Thanks Fromsoft
W game. Im only 8 hours in and its everything I wanted.
I own this on my PS5, but all I can say is that its a very hard but fun game. If you ignore the hard parts it will become the best game you will probably ever play

This game will make you cry, but it's the good kind of crying
The game was pretty easy. It took me 72 and a half hours to pick my class and customize my character and only 30 minutes to beat the final boss
hard but good

cant do shit after 1st boss

this game is perfect for new players, it is welcoming, the tutorials are just insane, event the QUEST descriptions are totaly on spot and every player knows exactly where to go. Give it a shot, best game i have ever played and its only SP I ever bought with my money. Nothing else was worth giving the actual money to studio that made it. Master piece.
Tremendous in size, tremendous in game play, tremendous in praise.
Elden Ring, le chef-d'≈ìuvre tant attendu de FromSoftware, nous transporte dans un monde vaste et envo√ªtant, fusionnant l'intensit√© des combats et la beaut√© m√©lancolique d'un univers po√©tique. D√®s les premiers instants, le jeu nous enveloppe dans une atmosph√®re unique o√π chaque paysage, chaque cr√©ature, chaque ruine raconte une histoire.

Un Monde Ouvert Sublime

L'exploration est au c≈ìur de l'exp√©rience Elden Ring. Les vastes √©tendues de l‚ÄôEntre-terre s'ouvrent devant nous, regorgeant de myst√®res et de secrets √† d√©couvrir. Les paysages, tant√¥t majestueux, tant√¥t d√©sol√©s, sont des toiles vivantes qui captivent l'≈ìil et l'√¢me. Chaque recoin de ce monde invite √† l'aventure, √† la contemplation et √† la r√©flexion. Les for√™ts embrum√©es, les ch√¢teaux en ruine et les marais hant√©s sont autant de tableaux po√©tiques qui suscitent l'√©merveillement et l'effroi.

Un R√©cit Myst√©rieux et Profond

Le sc√©nario, riche et cryptique, se d√©voile peu √† peu √† travers des dialogues sibyllins, des descriptions d'objets et des rencontres √©nigmatiques. L'histoire d'Elden Ring est une √©pop√©e complexe o√π les th√®mes de la chute, de la renaissance et de la qu√™te de sens se m√™lent. Chaque personnage, qu'il soit alli√© ou ennemi, contribue √† tisser une trame narrative dense et poignante. Les r√©cits des PNJ sont des fragments de po√©sie sombre, ajoutant une profondeur √©motionnelle √† notre p√©riple.

Des Combats Chor√©graphi√©s

Les affrontements dans Elden Ring sont de v√©ritables ballets de violence et de gr√¢ce. Le syst√®me de combat, h√©ritier des pr√©c√©dents jeux de FromSoftware, est pr√©cis et exigeant. Chaque duel est une danse mortelle o√π la moindre erreur peut √™tre fatale. Les boss, imposants et redoutables, sont des po√®mes √©piques en eux-m√™mes, n√©cessitant patience, strat√©gie et habilet√© pour √™tre vaincus. Ces combats sont autant de moments de tension et de lib√©ration, des apog√©es dramatiques qui marquent notre aventure.

Une Musique envo√ªtante

La bande sonore d'Elden Ring, compos√©e par Yuka Kitamura, est une symphonie d'√©motions. Les m√©lodies, tant√¥t douces et m√©lancoliques, tant√¥t √©piques et imposantes, accompagnent parfaitement chaque moment de notre p√©riple. La musique transcende le jeu, ajoutant une couche suppl√©mentaire de po√©sie et d'intensit√© √† l'exp√©rience globale.

Conclusion

Elden Ring n'est pas seulement un jeu vid√©o; c'est une exp√©rience artistique et √©motionnelle. Chaque √©l√©ment, des graphismes √† la musique, des combats au r√©cit, est soigneusement con√ßu pour cr√©er une aventure immersive et m√©morable. L'Entre-terre est un po√®me √©pique que chaque joueur √©crit √† mesure qu'il explore, combat et survit. En r√©sum√©, Elden Ring est une odyss√©e po√©tique qui r√©sonnera longtemps dans le c≈ìur et l'esprit de ceux qui s'y aventurent.

far less funny and frantic than Garfield cart furious racing
Garfield racing is one of the only TRUE souls likes out there. too many games use the Term souls like incorrectly. only my precious Garfield uses it correctly.

Matthew Mayhem is a much more interesting character than Margit who shows up too many times and makes me bored and in the mood for dark souls 3. When Matthew Mayhem was dragged onto the pirate ship i was laughing very much. Margit had no such moment.

Its just a great game
More than worth game of the year that it recieved. PvP is a bit lacking but everything else is top tier.
I don't exaggerate when I say this game has brought back a sense of childlike wonder and magic feeling that I hadn't felt in years playing a game. I've fallen in love with the medium all over again after thinking I'd seen it all. The sense of achievement, challenge and discovery is masterful and I can't wait to dive deeper into this world more to uncover all its mysteries. I'm late to the party but the Fromsoft formula finally clicked with this one and I couldn't be happier
they didnt have ultrawide support which really sucked. Its a great game but wow this really sucked if you have a nice monitor. guess they catering to the poor people.
goob game.
feels like Breath of the Wild but with more interesting and novel encounters, high replayability and some of the most fun online play ive ever had with Invasions.
 the wrold must suffer as i have
DAS IST DAS BESTE SPIEL JEMALS
I bought the game 3 times now do I need to say more ?
So beautiful and enjoyable and reconfigurable. You can get lost in building, refining and changing your play style. An amazing game!

10/10 that's it.
its ok
This game is a emersive awsome experince that will change your life forever worth every cent it reimbursed my faith in video games

Really amazing game! Liking a lot.
very expansive, lots to do, and somewhat challenging combat :)
Best Souls game so far
ELDEN CRING
I Broke 5 Xbox controllers playing this ..... 10/10 will continue to break controllers
Even my girlfriend likes it!
Great game. It's definitely easier than most Soulslike games due to the fact that it's open world so you can grind or just leave an area if you find yourself stuck, but the story and lore are incredible. 9/10
best game ive ever played
amazing game
amazing game when u know a bit and lvl up, but is hard at the start
Interesting story, challenging, immersive, amazing music, good quality, good for beginners who want to get into this genre of gaming, and life-changing.
what the fuck is this camera?
Not my type of game, worst game I've spent money and time on.
great-sword my beloved
An amazing game that actually makes you feel accomplished
Its pretty good
play it - incredible game
GUD GAME
everything
I like this game.
this game is gud
Still don't know what the elden ring is 10/10
didnt really fuck with it
obviously
Almost insurmountable amount of content. The fact that some other companies put out AAA games with artificial gameplay lenghtening mechanics, while here you get 100+ hours of generally great content really shows how great FromSoftware is.
Cannot stress this enough: BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PUT MY EYES AND HANDS ON!
its aight
So annoying, yet so addictive. Insanely hard, yet so simple. You switch from hating to loving it in just a few minutes. An almost flawless masterpiece for people that like exploring and challenging combat.
...good game
This game is lowkey buttcheeks, I have 208 hours played and have never made it past the first boss, this game is so stupidly hard I don't think anyone has ever beat it, and if they have let god or whatever deity presides over these lands strike me down. The game makes it so hard to level up! I have to kill these same boring enemies over and over just to get enough health to withstand a single queef from Margit the Pussy Farting lord of cinder or whatever. game sucks.

Edit: Thanks to some kind feedback from the Reddit community I figured out there is a boss before Margit called the Soldier of Godrick and it turns out that confidence boost of having beaten a single boss allowed me to show this game who is actually the big boss! B) Thanks!
this game has no downsides
-is maidenless

I guess it's kinda cool, idk tho man. (I WANT THE DLC... NOW!)
shit lowkey fire
Just an all around great game if you love open world rpgs with a deep rooted story.
Gameplay is also so smooth
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories. Thank you FromSoftware.

good game
It's a great game but when replaying the game going through Liurnia is so boring
its a perfect game buy it
as good as baldurs gate

the most torture you can even face if you want to torture yourself more play a keyboard

Game of the decade. Actually insane the quality of this game!

update - I LOVE THIS GAME
great game if u think its hard u have a skill issue
omg i love this game so fckn much
im cuming to this game
You died. You died again. You died. You died again.
might go crazy and become very violnet, still a good game
Good game, not too bothered about bosses or achievements, I just go all around areas with a telescope and observe, it's great
This game is the peak example of great gameplay, no other game comes even close to it. Best FromSoftware game so far.
This game is a culmination of what FromSoftware have learned over the years of making the souls games. It's a perfect blend of Souls and open world, this game is as close to perfect as you can get. One of the best games ever made.
As always, Fromsofts delivers The best in class !

Needs more tiddys.
Amazing game, still come back and play it after 2 years. This game does not disappoint, I would just recommend everyone have fun and play it how you want!
woke game
good game after you defeated marget the fell omen its easy til gorlock :)
Yes it is a masterpiece
Yes it is the best game I ever played.
I hope that my expectations for the DLC aren't to high!
This game is shit. I hate my self. I am gay
its pretty good

yes
I just love this game 10/10
I became Elden Lord for Melina, worth it.
OHHHHH ELDEN RING my beloved. 10/10 Game
Visually? Game is 10/10. But Elden ring fans will way overhype the game beyond what its worth. It throws atleast 2-3 repeats of unironically 90-95% of the bosses. Occasional repeat bosses are fine in games, but not when its done to this degree. The whole "over a hundred bosses" Thing id deceptive because not including duplicates theres not even HALF remaining. Not to mention alot of bosses just dont give room to attack with the heavier weapons, you either end up having to damage trade or wait about 5 attack cycles to swing once. The game is wonderful, but its not worth the praise and price tag. Overall id give the game a 6.5 at best.
i am in shambles rn
niga

good
Elden ring has changed my life for the better. The graphics in this game will make a grown man cry i have never had a more enjoyable experience, if you are on edge about buying it DO IT!!!!!! This came has made me sad, mad, happy, confused and horny i promise you will enjoy this game.
bad game... like accually in my opinion its bad... and yes ive played soulslike before i just dont enjoy this game i regret wasting my money
best game ever made 


Love
Without a doubt the best game of the last Years :))
good but takes alot of dedication and time however very good

Fantastic game.
too much filler, its ok if you like exploring filler content

I love  dung eater and the voice line: I am malenia blade of miquella,  <3 <3 <3 <3

I don't rly have to say anything about this game, you already know.
More then enough to fill my Dark Soul with joy, maidenless/10
I suck at it but it's a crazy good game
didn't give it a proper chance in 2022 but now im addicted
As a DS veteran and real fan I ask you to add Ukrainian language. At list 40% of those who play your game with russian localization are actually ukrainians and we would like to see this game in our native translation. Many companies did so already and it would be nice to see this happened in FromSoftware Inc.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It is vast, mysterious, challenging and beautiful. If you yearn to explore the gloomy crypts, dangerous dungeons and fantastical landscapes of a word rich in myth, lore and danger this is the game to play. From the visuals to the violence this game fulfills the promise of adventure that was made so long ago. FromSoftware have proven beyond a doubt that given time, technique never fails. GOTY forever.
One of the best titles in the souls like games yet, they never seem to stop releasing bangers.

The gameplay is challenging, the lore is interesting and the combo's, builds and styles are near limitless. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to get it, be warned though it is a challenge but you have freedom to get stronger before fighting bosses.
W game , died more times then I can count :D

Elden ring is like linux. It's awesome if you have the time to learn on how to play it well
I like game but i suck
Quit two months into game because of Morgott. Quit 1 month after beat Morgott due to Godrick. Quit 2 moths after Godrick because of Radahn. Beat game 1 month after beating Radahn. 100% a week ago. Can any other game make me do this?

worth ittttt
masterpiece
I platinum'd the game on PS at launch and it's a masterpiece in my eyes. The exploration, the universe and the combat are my favorite parts. Some dungeons are a bit meh and I think some bosses aren't perfectly designed for all builds (same as in DS3 for example).
The game runs amazing on my PC and it runs great on my deck (even though it decimates the battery as expected).
Gam gud maybe this game will be as popular as Crab Souls one day
Elden Ring has become my absolute favorite game of all time, and for good reason. From the moment I started playing, I was completely hooked. The world is incredibly vast and beautifully detailed, every inch begging to be explored. I found myself constantly in awe of the stunning landscapes and intricate designs. It felt like every corner of the map held some new secret or challenge waiting for me.

The combat in Elden Ring is something else entirely. It's tough, but that just makes every victory feel so much more rewarding. I had to really think about my strategy, timing, and approach for each enemy, especially the bosses. The feeling of finally taking down a tough opponent after numerous attempts is indescribable. Plus, with so many weapons, spells, and ways to build my character, each playthrough feels unique.

What really blew me away was the depth of the lore and storytelling. The narrative is rich and layered, and I loved piecing together the story from environmental clues, item descriptions, and character dialogues. It made every discovery feel significant and added a whole new level of immersion.

I also had a blast with the co-op and PvP elements. Teaming up with friends to tackle difficult areas or jumping into PvP battles kept the game exciting and unpredictable. It added a whole new layer of fun and replayability.

In short, Elden Ring is everything I could ever want in a game and more. It's beautiful, challenging, and deeply engaging. Whether you're a fan of FromSoftware's previous games or new to their style, this game is a must-play. It has rightfully earned its place as my number one game in the world.

This might be the worst game I have ever played in my life. This is hot garbage. The creators of this game can suck the poop out of my butt and throw it up and then eat it again and keep doing that in a loop. I can't describe how absolutely terrible this gunk off my nostril of a game this is.
YESSSESSESESES

It was GOTY for a reason. Hands down one of the best games to be made. FromSoftware outdone themselves.

Fun game, even though I die a lot. Like, a lot... I'm really, really awful at these games.

its good if people say its hard and needs a difficulty its a skill issue (though seriously ask comunity discord people are chill and down to help if a boss is hard as actman said level up vigor)
Guess what? Played the entire game with an easy mode cheat. Bet I had more fun. Still died more times than any other game. Still beat the elden jello man. Pumped for the sequel!
Awsome game, but it takes a while to get good at fighting.
this game is an absolute hoot if i can be honest, no disrespet
Best Souls game i have ever played
painful
if you have an interest in souls games this is a great place to start. As an absolute shitter of a gamer this game has taught me mechanics that appears in most of the soulsborne series and is a great way to find out if you have what it takes to beat the other games
got gud

15/10
this is one of the worst game experiences ive ever had the displeasure of playing. No tutorial, just thrown into bs. Game makes you quit before you even fucking start. so much gay fucking lore that youll never have enough time to understand. not to mention its poorly optimized considering the ungodly cash flow the devs have. I would not recommend this game to anyone that enjoys real games like fps shooters and real time strategy games. this game is pure luck and chance, takes forever, and is one of the most boring routes ive ever seen in my life. Fuck you eden wring
It's a Fromsoft game, so you know what to expect. Fabulously fun, lots of replayability, variety in playstyle options, fascinating lore - and so on.
good times if you like sekiro
good game
Elden ring is a fabulous game, I'd recommend it to anyone
poor progression, enemies overpowered for the sake of overpowered, not challenging, just unfun.
buggy teleporting enemies, bosses in early game areas, nonboss enemies that 1-3 shot player w/ stagger, player can not stagger enemy back, locking into instadeath, mechanics have not evolved since 2011, would not recomend

- lot of reused textures and enemies but in this big scale of map i guess it's understandable
- for pvp my complains are about whan ever I start play co-op with my friend we get instantly invided even straight from begining that puts you usually in big disadvantage ageinst players who finished the game have all good gear and finished build doesnt matter if they get reduced dmg and life than i end up helping him with my char on ng+7 i was able to connect to player who was on first play thrue that makes no sense

pain in ass but good

i like the pot people
4/10.  BELOW Average.  The game is gorgeous, don't get me wrong.  Diverse enemies and environments.  But Elden Ring is a nightmare.  There is no difficulty setting, no introduction to the world (not really) or even much of a story (at least as I've been playing and running around).  "You are maidenless.  You need a "maiden."  "Why?"  "Because..."  OKAY!  

Here's a Giant Pumpkin Head boss in a new instance dungeon.  I wonder what his story is?  Oh, he just wants to kill you because.  He's the guardian of the instance.  Can you explore it?  No, because Giant Pumpkin Head kills you before you can progress. 

You don't know what you're supposed to do as there are no quests, except to kill everything, where you are, who the people you're fighting are, or WHY you're doing what you're doing.  A few hits from ANY enemy, and you're dead.  You're handed a stick, now go kill God.  And everyone is at war with you, short of a few NPCs and traders.  

Call me a clown.  Call me what you want, but I want options in my video games to make it enjoyable for EVERYONE.  Not a kid dropped in the deep end and expected to swim just because.  I can't kill a single boss, sub-boss, and even mobs are near impossible because as soon as you engage, the horns go off and half the map descends upon you.  Thus, I can't level up and become more powerful to get to where I need to go to progress the story in the most basic way.  

I've played six (6) hours, killed a few individual enemies; a lone warrior with good looking gear (yet had nothing) and spent 45 minutes individually killing a mob hauling a huge shiny carriage.  Was there any cool gear in there for my effort?  No.  Just a regular, gray axe I don't even use.  I still have the most basic of gear and spells.  I feel like I'm running around avoiding everything the game has to offer because of the fear of death.  No health or MANA regeneration, so there's also that added headache as well.  Enjoy your diverse, amazing abilities and powers!  But only a little bit.  

I even downloaded a mod  for "Very Easy" mode, with 25% more damage and 70% damage reduction.  Still too difficult.  WTF am I playing?  Dying against every enemy 50 times until I get lucky or figure out their routine isn't fun for me.  How am I supposed to continue if every encounter uses all of my potions?  I'm a casual player.  Dying over and over and over again isn't relaxing or fun in a video game.  It's ANNOYING.  And the game is BORING because I can't explore or fight anything.  Unless you're a masochist, don't buy this title.  The hype is just hype.  (I also don't like breaking open piles of dung for loot...)
No amazing chest ahead, only despair.
Mwah
i love feet almost as much as fromsoft
awesome game
BEST GAME EVER 10/10 GAME OF THE DECADE I LOVE THIS SHIT I BOUGHT IT 20TIMES JUST TO SUPPORT FROMSOFT

BUY THIS GAME! YE TARNISHED! YE DEAD, WHO YET LIVE! THE CALL OF LONG-LOST GRACE SPEAKS TO US ALL!
This is one of the nicest games I've ever played but a warning is that you will need a decent computer and mad skills for this game. Overall I would let Malenia rot me away any day!
Best game I've ever played would recommend to anyone
The best introduction to Souls Genre and Souls-like games. Very high replay value. Very high quality visuals and audio. Very high death rate.
THE GOAT OF games
This game made my depression even worse "please play it its a master piece" they said...
I strongly advice you to play it!!!!!!!!

Cons
Invasions aren't as fun as previous souls games due to gankfests
(unless you're not a casual and git gud...I'm the best at this game)
better than alexi cote the third from montreal robertson
This game is very frustrating but OMG so amazing, the graphics are insane the expansive open-world experience in one game it is outstanding
Masterpiece!!!!! The Best!!
WARNING: This is a heavy grind game from a "grind game" studio and fans like it for its ridiculous difficulty and full lack of player guidance and cherished by a niche fan group. IT IS NOT a good-looking Zelda-type open-world rpg. I suspect many others buy/bought this game in false expectations like me.
 If you haven't played any games in the Souls series, but you're curious, this may be the perfect entry for you. The open world allows you to bypass the "brickwall" bosses and levels Dark Souls is known for, and this game has more character build options than any other game in the series. The combat is the smoothest it's ever been (A lot of people say Bloodborne is the best for combat, but I haven't played it). 

You're given the option to respec your levels after one of the first bosses. You can change you're appearance at any point once you unlock the hub. This game has the best character customization. in the series. You don't need to create multiple characters to try out different builds. This game also has more story lines and endings than the other Dark Souls games. The quests are not super difficult to follow, but due to the size of the game and lack of any quest tracking system, it is very easy to miss them, or screw them up.
This game changed my life, and it runs really smooth on the steam deck 10/10 i would recommend this for anyone who just got a deck and doesn‚Äôt know what game to buy
As long as you are rich enough top replace broken controllers frequently or just dont break them good game
maidenful
This game is just so good man, but why are there two Astels?
masterpiece.
Game's too short, the open world's way too small, the mobs are way too polite and the bosses are just too easy and predictable, especially that valkyrie woman that flies on a jet-propelled sword in a smelly cave. And if that wasn't enough, my unicorn stops every 50 yards to take a dump. I couldn't take it anymore so i bought Pong. And by the way, don't trust those people who talk about tank builds...there's not even a T-34 in this game!!
Runebears are harder than the final boss 10/10
its good

Most fun open world game I'v ever played, and one of the few games i'm def playing through twice. So much fun highly recommend. 

PS: If your worried it's too hard. Farm harder or summon friends!
the bell bearing hunter in caelid was harder than elden beast 10/10
No reason needed its Elden Ring.
Big up
The world of Elden Ring and its story are definitely 18+, but it is rich and atmospheric. The game is challenging but is open-world, so you can play at your own pace as you open up areas. Expect to grind some of the content multiple times, though.
Fromsoft's best game
The <ELDEN RING> is the best souls like game for me, it wake me up on the the last time with the university semester 1 year 1, but it also take me fallen of the final exam. It is unfortunately, but is the only one bad point for me. I really looking forward to the additional expansion content. The <ELDEN RING> is the best, absolutely.
I still argue that Bloodborne is still Miyazaki's best work to date, but anyone reading this isn't concerned about my opinion.
One of the best games ever made?
You fight people and giants and you have sword and staff and fight big people with arms and dragons and they big and scary to fight because they look scary with lots of hands and arms and legs and they are fat and tower over you and you can play mods with friends to beat the boss and do a whole thingy and thingy and thingy and you can fight lots of guys that you would fight in a fight with big guys when youw ouild fight them in a fight

I've beaten it on PS4. The game turns you into part-time warrior, part-time archaeologist, if you want it to. FromSoftware gives you the story to figure out, or not, on your own. Going in ignorant of what's going on is the  best way to enjoy this game, and then try to put together the pieces yourself. It has a supportive community, awesome armour and weapons, unique talismans, and is breathtakingly beautiful and hideous in all its golden glory. Enjoy yourself. Don't get discouraged. See it through to the end. You can do it.
the best game ever made
Anything Jacob doesn't like I do and vice versa
The most accessible FromSoftware game for sure due to the open-world nature of it and the built-in summoning system. Totally amazing game. Unbelievably dense, lore rich, complex, and the bones of the game are perfectly built. Also

Im an Elden Lord now. So give me free awards i want to be RICHHHH!
Looking at my hours played on Elden Ring I'm shocked. I usually get bored with games within the first hour. I have multiple games where I play until the last boss and quit entirely. Something about Elden Ring is engaging from start to finish and it is a renewed experience every time you start over, keeping you hooked for hours and hours of entertainment. 

Elden Ring was my first souls game and I've loved it so much I went back and played all the other souls games (and big souls likes) but Elden Ring is by far the most fun I've ever had in gaming. One of the nice things about the game is even noobs to the genre can come in and play because of the integrated accessibility options. Can't beat a boss cuz u suck? Go somewhere else and come back when you're over leveled. Still can't beat it? Use a summon. Don't feel bad about cheesing a boss because you can always come back in future playthroughs and change the experience by doing the fight differently. Magic vs strength vs dex builds all play completely different. 

Very much looking forward to the expansion to add more depth and content to the game to push past 500 hours on my way to 1000. üòÇ
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER OH MY GOD ITS SO SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD

First Soulsborne game, and I'm in love. The lore is so deep that I can't believe this game isn't based on a series of books. Try harder, and don't give up. Combat is tough, but extremely satisfying when you finally overcome your enemy.

ELDEN RING... OHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING
c:
Highly recommend this !
Elden Ring is an immerse and powerful experience of a game that will put you through an absolute wringer of emotions. It will take you from anger to exhilaration as you confront hardship and overcome it, keeping you on the edge of your seat. 
This game has more to it than just "Dark Souls", with jaw-dropping vistas, the enormous world, and the frequently harrowing enemies that will leave you in awe. A fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration, Elden Ring is not a smooth-edged, one-size-fits-all kind of experience. It relishes in confronting players with unfavorable odds and delights in watching the ensuing struggle. 
Whether you‚Äôre wielding a sword, casting spells, or dodging attacks, every moment feels intense. Overall, Elden Ring will live on in our collective minds well after many other games are dead and buried, resonating with players who crave adventure, mystery, and the thrill of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds. Prepare to be captivated by its dark beauty and immerse yourself in a world that demands both skill and determination.

A wonderful game. The open world, level design, boss and weapon design, music - everything is top notch. For fans of dark fantasy, the game is definitely a must-have for the play.
GIT GUD
finger, but hole
Best game ever!!
I'm going to be playing this game for years and years to come.

One of the greatest games ever made 10s across the board
An almost perfect game, fit for a GOTY winner.
Suffers a bit from "open-world repetitive content syndrome", but WAY LESS than most open world titles.
It has less memorable, creative enemies and bosses than DS1 and DS3. But thats expected due to its scale being larger than ever.
It beats nearly all other soulslike titles in its gameplay, especially Demon Souls and the Dark Souls series, since it borrows a lot of the positive aspects from each game, combining and improving on them.
the goat

Oh Pickle, Oh Pickle! Game of the Decade, and it's not even close. There is no better feeling in gaming than finally getting past a boss that's been bending you over for hours. Elden Ring let's you live that feeling over and over and over again. I can't recommend it enough.
game hay vailon
Behold, Tree!


üå≥
BEST GAME TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THE GAME WITH HOW HARD AND BIG THE MAP IS BUT IT IS WORTH BUYING AND DESERVED A GOTY AWARD
ive died soon much
Before I ever fought the first boss, I spent 3 hours exploring the whole bottom half of the map and didn't even realize that isn't what i was supposed to be doing. Game is super fun, but will make you rage.
Arise Now, Ye Tarnished
At B K have it your way. Oh way this is Elden ring?

best souls game. no notes
tough game fun game!
This Game is so punishing that if you bought it on release date you have to spend an extra $20 for the DLC
this game is so punishing that if u biough it on release date u have to spend more to get the dlc

this game makes my weenie hard
AHHHHHHHH

TOGETHAAAAAAAAAA WE WILL DEVOUR THE VERY GODS
screw this game 10/10 tho would play again
Gettin ready for dat new DLC next month son. Played this multiple times on Xbox now going through it again on Steam

Cant wait to hear Malenia's lines looped for 4 hours ingame again
yes
Thoughtful and deep game with genuine effort and care in every corner.
terrible awful game im convinced anyone who says otherwise needs a lobotomy
game
94 hours in and my heart is broken.. rip Alexander the pot
Few games I complete let a lone play over again. This game is amazing any one that likes souls games in anyway this is must play. But you owe it to your self to play it all the way trough if you do. Just never give up.
Its Pretty close to perfect tbh
Define my Elden Ring Experience?
Wtf was that move, wtf how did I not dodge that, wtf how did I dodge that. Over all shit was sick now i buy DLC and to regret my decisions once again
As my first souls game 10/10
good
berry gut
very difficult
ive played all the souls game except dark souls 2 but oh boy is this game beyond overhyped and worshiped for no reason except the fact that you can avoid the main story bosses and go level up then come back and easily twerk on them. do yourself a favor and play the better games in the series, solid 5/10 maidenless game
Fuck Fire Giant!
epic and based
Skill issue
- Buy game for $60 at release
- Wait two years for DLC announcement
- DLC pre-order for $40
- New game + DLC edition drops for $80
- Base game still $60
- No upgrade option for current owners

One of the best games I have ever played, everything just looks beautiful.
I would be lying if I said this game was a 10/10. Some bosses feel forced, too difficult, badly placed, overpowered even. Sometimes the running around feels too weird, and the lack of the true Dark Souls run back is sometimes missed due to how beautiful the environments are. Sometimes I hate this game, as it just feels like there is no reason for things to be set up the way that they are, and overall it's just janky sometimes. 

But god damn if it isn't Elden Ring though. The most beautiful scenery of the entire franchise, perfectly sculpted environments and an overwhelming amount of mainline content, side content, secret content, it's just the content king. If you don't like something, chances are you don't have to do it. You can find any weapon/spell for any playstyle, and it feels like everything is viable. There's no boss that's too difficult in any bad reason, in this game you truly just have to get good to beat things. There is no other game like this game, FromSoft took everything that they had been building for decades and polished it into this masterpiece. Unfortunately, due to some slight letdowns (Some bosses as time went on got less and less epic-proportion-esque, probably due to Covid...) this game isn't truly perfect. But it's as close as anything will ever be... 9.5/10
Epic story epic battles must play I had loads of fun since it was released and still have equal fun to this day no matter how many times I beat this game! highly recommended to all of you must play if you have not already!
Best Souls game bar none.
once in a decade video game
GOTY
like be so fr jus buy it
This game is legit the best game ever this was my first ever souls game and i didnt think i would like it but i actually ended up loving it the combat story and the mods all make this game an 11/10

A standout game. On my 4th play through and still finding new areas. Still holds up 2 years down the line and the DLC is out in a month, I am beyond excited. Now just get Sony to publish Bloodbourne and Demon Souls on PC.
THE POWER
no support for day one players greedy DLC pricing
first souls game i like very much
HARDLY EVEN DIFFICULT.... I DEFINITELY BEAT IT SUB 3 HOURS....
peak

This game is great way to find out whether or not you need anger management classes
Entry level souls game. If you suck at Dark Souls then this game is for you. Still challenging but doesn't make you want to cook your dog and eat it. :)))))))))
Best game

Its a classic.
If you're reading this, you're maidenless.

literally the best game ever made it makes feel things i have never felt before i think im actually attracted to this game
ELDEN RING
It was a great first Souls experience and led to me playing Dark Souls
If you're iffy on trying out a Souls game I'd suggest starting with this one
0/10 you cant wear the ring...

The game is awesome and the music is top notch.

(get this game! :))
Rise Ye Tarnished!
Why is it always head?
Long play through, lots of options, difficult
Best game sof all time deserved every title and its defenetly worth the money it costs.10/10 must play expirience on th same level if not better then dark souls 3
There are some fun parts i guess.
if u game at all u need this in ur library. hard stop.
FromSoftware found a formula over a decade ago that has stood to this day. Their latest iteration of that formula sees the player transverse the Lands Between to mend the Elden Ring, becoming the Elden Lord over a fresh, new Order.

Another challenge posed and conquered. Highly recommended, 5/5

+  3rd-person magic/sword combat has been well executed, quite close in style to previous games. Lots of skill overlap between this and previous entries. 
+  Building characters around weapons feels rewarding. Variety of scaling combinations among weapons opens build variety. 
+  Ashes of war are a great iteration of weapon skills, being able to mix & match lets comfort weapons become fresh.
+  Vistas everywhere. Taking time to see the scenery is a staple of the soulsborn franchise, it's just as rewarding here.
+  Lore galore. Several hundred item descriptions to sift through. Thick plot to sink any number of budding teeth into.
+  Spirits do so much damage and distracting, they are a favourite addition of mine. With the meta so tightly wound with spending time buffing its great to see a solution to relieve pressure. Good for the accessibility of the game as well.

-  Field/Catacomb bosses are repetitive.
-  Builds are almost too good, mobs in New Game get pulverized very quickly with most setups. New Game+ is the most viable its been in a few games, though.
-  Groups are invaded before solos, making invasions much harder overall.
-  High minimum system requirements, albeit not unexpectedly.
is good
My first souls-like game and I can't stop
i fucking LOVE this game

fweaking  hard
Mogfathers one and all. Edge rizzness
Lots of fingers
Great game, def a skill issue if your having issues with bosses

Best Game :)
Xyn
I will never stop glazing this game. 10/10
I gave this game a chance it wasn't worth a second of the 25 hours I've spent playing it
this one game of the year for a reson
crucible knight duo is the best boss in the game, i like so much!!
no other game has conjured this amount of awe and majesty, and its just so...playable! an all timer entry into video games
I've never been more proud of my friends for forcing me to play this, it's a masterpiece.
good game
amazing game YOu should really buy this game

I will buy the coming DLC.

Love it
After 350 hours i can say this is one of my fav games
good

This game is just a MASTERPIECE!!!.. There is nothing more close to perfection than this game! Starting with the gameplay that is just incredible. The graphics and the ambiance of the game is nothing less than beautifull. The exploration is almost endless. And the music is Amazing... The Bosses are perfectly designed. They are a real challenge and makes you wanna grind the games for hours at a time. The emotions you feel when you beat a boss is so satisfying and makes you want to seek more of that feeling. AMAZING combat mechanics and style. Almost endless move set for the weapons and satisfying combat. This game cannot be compared to any other game. This is a one of its own experience and beautifullness. Does it deserve the game of the year.. YESSS it does. This is the best game ive played. WAITING ON THE DLC AND EXPECTING NOTHING LESS FORM THEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS !!!!
ive just beaten the game. its a banger except for godskin duo
10/10
>get horse
>run past all enemies
>bosses are super easy
>make 1 mistake and they oneshot u 
>still super easy

boring, get darksouls 3 instead
big sword
I might be terrible at this game, but this game is far from terrible...

This game is bloody amazing!

There's so much to do, so much to explore and the best part is, I don't just mean the open world itself. As a player you have so many different weapons to find, obtain and then choose from, some have unique skills tied to them whilst others you end up making unique through various ashes you can apply to them, which leads to there being plenty of ways to play the game and overcome the various challenges presented. So no matter what build you end up making, whether you're making something on your own or following a guide, it all boils down to how you do it and how well you can pull it off.

That's the number one thing I love about Elden Ring. There's multiple ways to beat the various enemies you'll encounter, be it a boss or a group of monsters in your way. Of course, there might be some methods that may take longer than others, whilst some might be more riskier in exchange to ending a fight sooner, whereas others may seem cheesier regardless of how safe or risky such a method might be to pull off, but the choice is yours and that's what matters.

I am excited to see what the DLC brings to the table, from the trailers I'm seeing? It looks like it's about to make an already big game, much bigger!

Dark Souls 2 Open World Edition
good game but i followed random guide on youtube that guy tricked and i dont have enough skillpoints to get the weapon in the guide cant do anything now since i basiaclly sold everything in my inv. dont play this game if you have skill issues like me

How do you have fun playing it?
dear miyazaki, you are a psychopath and i love you. Thank you for the grace-given.
This game literally changed my life!
GOAT
Awesome game. Everyone should try it for at least 2 hours. Don't like it after 2, refund it.
Worst game ever
Probably the best game I have ever played, and likely the best game that will ever exist for me.
the perfect blend of difficulty and discovery. cant beat a boss? unlike other souls games you can go kill the same bird for an hour and be buff. dont know where to go? go anywhere because everything is interesting. i can think of so many contexts where this game is perfect, whether its fighting huge bosses or just walking around and looking at cool piles of swords. i have massive adhd and still havent beaten the game but i have like 7 half baked builds and all of them are super fun. and frankly, i dont need to beat this game to enjoy it. i will beat it though, i swear, the int dex build is the one.
Whose hand writeth thy review, i wonder? Or perhaps, thy opinion is thine own?
I didn't like the Souls games, I do like Elden Ring.
One of the best game i've ever played
hands down best game ever made
Praise The Dog!
elden bling
One of the best games I've ever played.
None of it makes sense (story or mechanical), it's grindy AF, the progression is weird and 99% percent of mechanics are actively bad dame design.
games good
My first souls game, truly the best i feel. being able to take a break from a boss or area and go do something else, cool off, and come back with a new mindest, or some new gear, is really lifechanging! 

This game is fantastic! a perfect 10 to me.

my only complaint is that the dodgeing can feel a little slow and laggy sometimes like a full half second goes by before the character actually rolls, but im sure it was intentional or something, 

GREAT GAME. worth every dollar!  :)
At this point everyone at least heard of this game. It's as close to perfection as it gets in the videogame industry.

Cool jar.
Best souls game

gud
Arguably the pinnacle of the souls series so far
Elden Bling
No horse ahead!
Pretty sure its the only game that ever compelled me to 100% it
The best entry in Fromsoftware's lineup to start with if you have never played a souls game! Fromsoft has the best lore and story of anyone out there!
gud game
Hell yea buy this game now!!!!!!
The best

Still no maidens. But I can beat Maliketh
This is the game of all time

There is a reason this game is seen as one of the best of all time. I shouldnt need to tell you why this game is amazing. Its a Souls game with all the benefits of an expansive open world game, multiple endings, 165 bosses, tons of weapons and item combos.... Its just a masterpiece.
This game needs a hard mode, a little to easy for me...
good
yep
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Very gut
Worth my lifesavings, atleast I can play Elden Bing on my deathbed.

I regret returning this game, im gonna wait for it to be on sale again and ill buy it again
Dark Souls 3
This game kicks my ass and I masochistically continue to try to become the Elden Lord anyway. Best game of the decade so far.
For once the messages were right, there was an invisible bridge.
OOOOOOH TARNISHED
I command thee kneel
good
I was hesitant to buy this game at first since the developer has a reputation for making games which are very difficult, but I'm glad I gave Elden Ring a shot.  This is the best new game I have played in a very long time.

Pros:

1. Build variety: There's a surprising variety of weapons and playstyles available, which are all viable and are different from each other mechanically as well as graphically.  Even among the strongest, most overpowered ways of building the player character, there is a lot of variety, and it's debatable which is even the best.

2.  Choose your own difficulty: Although there's no easy mode, the game does an excellent job of allowing you to choose your own difficulty: grinding levels, getting certain powerful weapons, using stronger or weaker spirit ashes (or indeed none at all, as many players seem to prefer), or exploiting a the poor situational awareness of certain enemies to slowly poison them to death instead of facing them head on.  It really is impressive how wide a range of skill levels are supported by the game without using of a menu with discreet difficulty settings.

3. Polearms:  Some games which feature melee combat don't make much use of polearms despite their historical significance, but ER has 3 classes of polearm (Spear, Greatspear, Halberd), and they're pretty good, in part because they have more range than most other weapons (weirdly appropriate, right?).

4. It's massive, but somehow everything seems to work:  I've come to expect that large games are going to be filled with bugs and unintended mechanics, but I guess this game's developer didn't get the memo, because ER is a massive game that actually works.

Cons:

1.  Although the game offers a lot of difficulty options, easy isn't among them.  If you want the game to be truly easy, or you have an aversion to seeing your player character die (a lot), then this might not be your thing.

2.  It might ruin other games for you, because it's *that* good.

Conclusion:

Although this game isn't for everyone, It is an excellent version of itself; so if the game interests you at all, you probably won't regret buying it.

verigood calm story game
amazing 10/10 i love it so much
My Ring. It is Elden.

Puckered. Tarnished.

Lovely game, though. Hopefully they'll optimise it a bit for the Terdtree. 

I would prefer less things to pop in.

That's it now. No more terrible Ring 'jokes'.
The best game and the worst game at the same time
mammy milenia
I played the game for 10 hours, killed the first tree sentinel and did not touch again for 2 years. Recently am giving it an actual try since the DLC looks interesting and holy heck why did I never actually give it a shot??? Genuine 10/10 game and I am only just reaching the fire giant.
goated
Need more.
elden
ja
This game has one of the best lore of any game i've played and i don't usually even like this kind of games.

The open world is also a perfect example on how to do open world right, there is so much to explore and secret stuff and that is something the vast majority of open world games don't have.

I don't like Dark Souls games but i love Elden Ring.
Absolutely
girlfriend left me but now i have more time for Elden Ring so Win for me
Whatever drugs the developer of this game took to think of such sick and fricking unbalanced enemys and bosses...

WHERE DID YOU GET THEM? I WANT THEM TOO!

Anyway i liked the game very much and can recommend it espacially if you really hate yourself really much and love seeing yourself suffering or love raging the hell out of your soul so your pc might end up learning how to fly üëçüëçüëç

Probably my favourite game of all time.

Half of all players on PC are cheating because, per usual, Japan doesn't give a shit what China and the rest of the world does because they have "region lock."  Which, don't forget, is really just "Japan lock."  So we're forced to play with the constant spam of chinese script kiddies and 12 year olds using VPNs to make matchmaking unplayable.  Just buy dark souls 3.  Or 1.  Or 2.  Actually, any soulsborne game that isn't this.
its like dark sould but easier

Think of it like the Witcher 3 and Dark Souls had a baby, which surpassed them both
very good
An amazing game. I 100% the game and it's very re-playable and with mods as well. If you're looking to purchase I highly recommended. At the time of writing this, the dlc is coming out soon which will add even more content to the game.
very good 

highly fun game, though a souls like game I argue its better then Dark Souls.

good game

hard
GOOD AWSOMMMMM
THUMP
.
yep
what just might be the greatest game of all time. bosses are fun and challenging there are thousands of ways to play the game, I would recommend this game to everyone to try at least once. Not even done with the game and I love every minute of it. there is one downside though...its way too addicting and you may think your playing for an hour but in reality its 3 hours
This has been my first Souls-like game. I wasnt really interested in the genre, "hard for the sake of hard" didnt really appeal to me. After playing through Armored Core 6, another supposedly hard FromSoft game, I decided to give ER a try. Ive found that while difficult, the bosses arent impossible. Ive one shot a decent amount of them so far, but Im not done yet. Still on my first playthrough at 250hrs. Theres a LOT of exploration to be done and secrets to be found. That unobtrusive bush against the side of the cliff? Yeah, its hiding an incredibly intricate cave system behind it. 

Do yourself a favor, get this game. Looking forward to running through all of the Souls games after this!
great game
everything good. nothing bad, :)
I LOVE ELDEN RING GREAT GAME

OK
great game but confusing quest line. Hard to follow a certain path and beat stuff in order.
Best Game OF all time

Playing Elden Ring is like embarking on a quest to find your lost sanity, only to realize it was hiding behind the next boss battle all along. from the exhilarating highs of defeating a monstrous foe to the frustrating lows of falling off a cliff for the umpteenth time, it's a rollercoaster ride through a medieval fever dream. Just when you think you've mastered the combat, a giant enemy wielding a toothpick sends you flying across the map. but hey, at least the scenery is beautiful. when you're not face-first in the mud. 10/10, would curse at my screen while simultaneously praising its brilliance again.
One of the best game ever created, worth every dollar
I AM MALENIA. BLADE OF MIQUELLA
Best Game ever

top game rn
Has all the flavor of a Souls game with some interesting new quirks and functions. I was impressed with how absolutely huge the game world is. I'd recommend it for anyone familiar with the Dark Souls series and any other Souls-like games.

An absolutely beautiful, unforgiving game. I have played for just under 50 hours and it feels like I have barely scratched the surface of Elden Ring. It is a wonderful, hilariously difficult experience that is extremely rewarding when you finally kill the boss you have been stuck on for the past hour.
this game is so amazing that I had to wait 2 years to play it. also I was scared. one of the best.
This game has brought me so much pain. I hate it. I can't stop playing it.
best game ive ever played
It's been a long while, Morgott. Long and hard didst thou fight. Tarnished Warrior. Spurned by the grace of gold. Be assured, the Elden Ring resteth close at hand. Alas, I am returned. To be granted audience once more. Upon my name is Godfrey, The First Elden Lord!
shits wack

Made me edge
Genuinely one of the best games i've played especially in recent years. i love learning the bosses moves and how to beat them

I still will never understand why there is no difficulty slider on games like this. Like how the fuck am I ever gonna beat a single boss?
Probably the best one
Best Game Ever
AMAZING
best game ever!
Love this game, the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome.  It is a little challenging at some points, so you may need to grind for certain items, however it is defenetly worth the money.

I am Elden, and this is my Ring.
Sloppy PC port, and can't even play offline without utilizing Easy Anti-Cheat
The thing i liked about it was that the combat was nice and the bosses are cool i have I have a big problem though I cant figure out where to go what to fight or anything really and it sucks.
Masterpiece
one of the best open world games every played with hours of exploring that rewards you
my anger issues cant handle this game, i'll come back in 5 years (this is my first souls game)
this game made me want to kill myself a some points but its worth it
Hard!!
The weapons and bosses are amazing! The amount of time it takes is good too.
EWRFWERFWERWER
best game i have ever played
A real challenge & doesn't give a helping hand making you find your own way
A masterclass in world design and scale. Have played it multiple times through on multiple consoles and still love it as much as the first time i played
look at kai's condition and you'll know
best game i ever played
One of the best game ever created.
kai cenat
SO FUCKING PEAK
this is one of , if not the best game ive ever played and i'm very excited for the dlc, all of the bosses had their quirks and difficulty but it was amazing nontheless. the ability to choose how you play was an amazing thing to add considering it opens the horizons to people who prefer bow combat, magic combat, or the giant assortment of weapons you're given. of course they are some weapons better than others, but that makes it all the more fun. if you're playing pvp against someone whos using meta and you win with an inferior weapon it feels so great, and sweeping bosses with something like bhf or rob is amazing feeling for new players, getting the timing perfect for bosses is amazing, and the first run-in against a crucible knight is a feeling you wont forget once you win. truly, 10/10 game, and experience.
Good gaming
beans
Foul Tarnished, I see youve found my comment
yippie woohoo yippie !!!ahahhah!!
its very fun and even though the bosses are hard it feels very rewarding when u beat them. its also fun to just explore
i suck ass at this game but holy dopamine feeling when u progress
This game has made me lose so many fucking brain cells

best game ever made if kai can do it you can too.
absolute peak fiction, cant wait for DLC
On my 7th journey and still having fun. I think that says enough about the game.
Great game
Forefathers one and all! Bear witness!
No maidens

It's just perfect
replayable

first time in a long time have touched so much "grass"
god
what can i say to such a perfect game. players just need to remember its just a flower game. AND LASTLY BUT NOT LEAST you need to try jumping of every cliff in elden ring bicose its just fun
cool swords makes me happy
Pros:
 - World is beatiful
 - Creatures are super unique
 - Weapons have great design and a lot of them to choose from.
 - Big amount of content and areas to explore, lot of secrets to find.
Cons:
 - Bad camera mechanics during combat
 - Some bosses with overtuned AoE damage attacks
 - Small armors pool to choose from
Good game
‚ñà
Peak game
I haven't played any souls like game before this one, and I can safely say Melania is hot
Worst souls game

My desk took a beating and my spirit is broken. 9/10 needs more scarlet rot lakes
One of the best games I've played, will definitely spoil you for other games.
easily one of the best games ever made. obviously this will be perceived as my opinion, but when you die and meet christ at the gates of heaven and he asks "what was the best video game ever created" and you answer with anything other than Elden Ring, you will undoubtedly get sent straight to the malenia boss fight room where you will spend eternity losing to her over and over. 

(and no, you will not be able to summon the "let me solo her" legend)
INFINITE GAMEPLAY. STORY NEVER GETS OLD, LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY PLAYTHROUGH, COLLECT EVERY ARMOR SET, WEAPON, AND HACK TF OUT IT WHEN U BEAT IT 10/10
Banger game
soild game worth the money
i beat this game multiple times there's a bunch of different challenges you can do as well as add mods to make the game harder or scramble the loot or mix up the bosses
This game is perfect
El mejor juego en steam.
.
I hate almost every boss in this game but I can't in good conscience give this a negative review.
all a tarnished needs is a hug
absolutely gorgeous
top 5 video games of all time
Phenomenal Game!
so FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
This game is absolute heattttt
I hate this game.

This game has profoundly changed my perspective on my life, being creative. I hated the game for the first few hours because Hard game no fun, but eventually I got better at it and fell in love with it. Plan to even get a tattoo of this game.

if you're okay with being mad at yourself for dying a bunch in a game I couldn't recommend it more. there were times I felt like I was going to break my controller in half with frustration towards myself, and yet I have beaten this game 5-6 times and can't get enough.


good
best game i ever played it is good from every view, graphic, story,  combat and a lot more, you always feel like you are in danger and its fun to face all kind of diffrent challenges and boses
boring game

bruh what u doin without this game in ur library like wtf buy it already cuh
very bad game not good game very very bad not worth money not good game very bad
I can't help myself.

big swords kill big boss
I've played all From Software games so far and by far Elden Ring is the most disappointing one. Open-world meant it lacks polishing in a lot of areas where in previous game the same things used to shine. Elden Ring has a lot of repetitive enemies, boring weapons, and mediocre soundtrack compared to past titles, plus a lot of empty space and boring procedural generated dungeons scattered around the world that feels the same.

Even though I love souls-like games, and I am playing Elden Ring at the moment, I can't give a positive review due to this game not being the best title From Software produced. Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice still remain peak in terms of gameplay.

Also, terrible optimization, From Software treats PC players as peasants ever since the first Dark Souls port ever brought to PC in 2012. Elden Ring runs very poorly at locked 60 fps even in very powerful machines, unacceptable for a title released in 2023 and a game of the year contender (and ironically, winner).

I don't recommend purchasing Elden Ring at full price, or at all, unless you're a true From Software fan. Other From Software games deserves much more attention and praise than this one.

TL;DR:
If you've played all other From Software games, this is pretty much more of the same, but less polished. It's a fun game, but nothing more than that, it fails to impress and still has the very same problems all From Software games always had.
Not worth it for first-time From Software player, skip it and start with Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Dies Twice.
this game cured my future depression
   What do we have here? An outstanding game. I wanted another Dark Souls game, so I waited. And it really paid off. Huge open world, lots of weapons, spells and awesome bosses. Soundtrack? GOD-tier. This game is just magnificent. I would highly recommend this game to every gamer.

Gameplay: 5/5
Story: 5/5
Design/graphics: 5/5
Soundtrack/audio: 5/5
[h1] Overall: 10/10 [/h1]

One of the best open world RPG,classic FormSoftware game with beautifull world ,art top notch ,level designs great,it however took me long time to gather basics from the game due to no hand holding and huge open world . Onece you get into it its great .
There are few things that i would consider negative some multiple copy pasted bosses ,Giant of Mountains is too big and quite empty overall i feel like world could be a bit smaller with less copy pasted or multiple same bosses just in duo or evel triple fighting same ones in one arena....
Following some quests without guides is horrible some characters wont tell u where u gonna find them so u have to explore every inch of every area and even than you can do something that interacts with quests you have no idea and not finish them anyways.
Also Malenia design wise does not fit elden ring more like Sekiro which feels like it was designed for,waterfall dance and self healing is straight up cheating . While its the most difficult boss in the game i feel like its worst design and fairness wise hope they wont do same BS in DLC
everything.
last boss sucks kuk
DS2 kinda better.

Incredible
FUCK YES
this game gave me a rock hard boner the first time i played on xbox, and playing it again on pc gave me a few extra inches, lets just say my boyfriend is really happy
burp
Yes, good game radahn best boss ever.
This game is a masterpiece of a game. It carries qualities of an action RPG, has adventuring, has a great difficulty curve (eventually, as you learn the game, you can dictate the difficulty by build selection and diversity, level capping, etc), has horror aspects, and overall can only be described as one of the greatest games you are likely to play regardless of the genre of gamer you are. 

I'm excited to dig in more and eventually 100% the game. Great build diversity is available to enable multiple play-throughs, providing nuance to the experience. Words cannot describe its greatness, one can only experience it. Also, don't give up; it will be hard, but it's arcade-like in that once you know how to maneuver your character and know the stage, you will be set to move forward. Good luck and enjoy.
This game doesn't have bed of  chaos. Swamp areas were ok. 6/10
i hate this game

i will continue to redownload it erase my progress, make it 2 hours in then drop it again
The best game ever.
i like play the game

peak ring peak elden  peak game masterpiece best game ever
Game constantly stutters on my system (Ryzen 5 2700, RX 5700XT) and drops to 5-10 fps then back to a constant 60. Tried every fix I could find to no avail. I love the souls games and am thoroughly disappointed in not being able to play this one due to an issue out of my control.
Pretty good
Simply put, amazing.
10/10
I'm not a Souls player, but Elden Ring is in a whole different league and after a lot of pain on bosses I finally enjoyed it

I cant do this anymore...
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that defies conventional gaming categories. FromSoftware has refined their decade-long formula to perfection. To me, it's a vivid, living world that occupies my thoughts even when I'm not playing. It's an experience that transcends words‚Äîone that demands to be fully immersed in and explored. Take the time to dive in; you won't regret it.

Um, fuck.
Yeah. It's a great game. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
Love you, Mistress ‚ô•

yuupieee
Try Elden Ring, but be wary of Death


 It always feels good to play souls games,  just dive into them and achieve goals,  no tedious, boring or abnormal gameplay mechanics (maybe with some bugs but not gamebreaking ones).
 And even if elden ring is the finale of the 'official souls genre',  I'm willing to accept it and happily experience a facinating ending of the wonderful journey through DLC. 
 CHEERS!
good game. hard. fun. :)
2nd time purchasing this game with hundreds of hours on the console version. Game is sick.
Amazing game overall.
Buy it and have fun !
One of the most frustrating and yet rewarding games I've ever played.
Eh..
BEST GAME

Even after beating this game 13 times and 100% it, I will never stop hating the Godskin Duo.

Love the difficulty of the souls game. Also, there isn't anything like getting jungle jumped by some red guy who is looking for your runes lol
At the moment I like it a lot and it is getting more and more addicting, lol
Amazing game worth the $$
very fun game, can get confusing and you wont know what to do, I suggest you look up videos on it. once you get the hold of it its very fun
lover ahead
But what if I tried a different build?
not much to say, one of the best games of all times
10/10 but dont overlevel yourself
Yes absolutely I would recommend this game.  If you are at all curious about Souls games, In my opinion, this is the place to start.  It's a lot more forgiving in the early levels if you get stuck on a boss, as you can just go somewhere else and level up.  Mid game you even get access to an area specifically designed by the devs for you to be able to grind levels if you need a boost.

Ok boring part over.  This game is beautiful.  Everything about it screams the love that the developers have poured into it.  Yes they want you to fall down a hole and follow your nose, but the online community these games have fostered means that there's always help, and advice if you need it. 

You'll get lost, and confused, and you'll die. Over and over again.  But in these games death is the point.  The point is that anything you could choose to do might be beyond you now, but all you have to do is play more, practice more, and you'll be able to do anything.  

Life skills, man.  Disguised as a video game.

PS, when you're ready, BLOODBORNE IS THE G.O.A.T.

PPS, I'm playing this game on PC for the first time.  It's already platinumed on Playstation, but FUCK SONY. PC ALL THE WAY.

So my experience in the game and the bosses I've killed do not match with my hours in game, because I'm currently following a checklist to get as much done in game before Shadows of the Erdtree comes out.  It's a giant collectathon, not at all an ideal way to play the game, but what are you going to do?
i need a cold cigarette after this one
game good
GREAT
yes
If no one believes in you. You must believe in yourself.
very nice
GREATEST GAME EVER CREATED OF ALL TIME EVER
My wife is a fan of the open rpg types, i was so excited when she got this to play with me. I may have neglected to tell her how FromSoft likes to "encourage" their players. Alas, I am maidenless once again... 10/10
haha this one hurts
the elder ring was no ever recoverd i put it in my as hole and lsot it
umm swing dodge swing dodge dodge die, mmmm very good
ytrurt
Satisfying to play and explore.  Hard, but not soul crushingly hard, you can always go level up if your having problems.  Probably the best game I've played in a decade.
hard

monkey see monkey do
what is that i dont want to fight that
Bonk an Womp

good

So much replay ability in it, goty 2022, if your looking for a game to piss you off every time you play it and then amaze you with its beauty your in the right spot.
If you can brave the difficult combat this game is a must play!
cheese
I died a lot... 10/10 would do it again
grapes
its ok i guess
fuckin love this game
uhh dont play it i now have every dark souls game now i beat them all i can not stop playing souls games its actually a problem
This game will drive you through the spectrum of emotions of a toxic relationship and I love it.
Great
 Only play if youre cool
pretty fun kinda js running around aimlessly rn tho lol
only watched my blindfolded grandma play it trough but looks like a good ds2 sequel
too hard
I beat this game before Lunakritical and he put 3x my hours into this game @Lunakritical
10/10
I hate this game so much. Would play again
Grind Grind Grind, Grind. and don't forget to grind
mmmmmmmmm i love getting a boss 1hp just for them to do an entire ass combo which is unavoidable
Masterpiece, I came into this game 2 years after its release and I was expecting the quality of the game play to fall behind newer titles but I was proven wrong. Elden Ring has exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to play more titles from FromSoft!
It's DS4, what's not to like?
fingers required
great
Suffering but still Fun 

ive played this for years, along with any ds game ever made. the only games i truly care about. All are a true masterpiece. More can never come fast enough
The story is pure crap.  You have no idea what to do and where to go.   This is just an open sandbox where you kill mobs not knowing why.  Graphics are nice...but the stroryline is inexistant.
I wish I could get my money back !    Well..at least I know I wont fell in the trap for the expansion coming soon.
NIHIL
VERY VERY VERY VERY HARD but fun
Deserves to be Game of the Year

It's a 50/50 if the game will work for you or not. The stuttering issue has not been fixed, and even though I had a blast defeating the first tutorial boss, the performance was unbearable. (For context, I can run Cyberpunk 2077 at max settings at a solid 90fps). 
Try the game, if you notice it's stuttering, refund it. There's a few things you can try (it's embarrassing that you have to in the first place)  that help the performance a bit, but none of the tricks will help enough.
This game is fun
roly poly

It's like snuggling up with a warm blanket on a freezing winter day.  Every time you play it, there's something new that you find you missed last time.  You come back a year later to do another playthrough, after something reminds of you of the game and you started wondering what different way you could play would be. 
 You struggle and rant and lose your mind against a boss until learn the nuances its attacks, and get the same rush after defeating it as you did in every From Software game from the last 10 years.  And then one day, you realize that jump attacks are OP as fuck and make the game too easy but there's no going back now because your brain is telling you this is the easiest path so just do it.  But it's still amazing.
Yes
Best Souls game by FromSoft to start with. First game I have made the effort to 100%
very good

one of the best games of all time
I wish I was Ranni's books
try fingers, but hole
play  it
I run, I find, I rest, I fight, I die, I level, I die again. 10 / 10
elden ring is amazing and hard and i like that. also mutiplayer sucks don't like this summon sign trash.
waiting Shadow of the Erdtree

Maidenless
Sadly, I cannot recommend this game because it is unplayable for a lot of people on PC. It's disappointing. I have a rig powerful enough to run a triple monitor 4k sim racing experience on iRacing, but I literally cannot move 10 ft without frame stuttering. The fact they are releasing DLCs for this game without addressing the stuttering is absolutely bonkers to me. Especially in a game where timing is everything. I refuse to buy this game for my PS5 because I am not giving them anymore money until they figure out how to do a damn PC Port correctly. I went through two computers and neither one of them could play this game, one Intel and now the latest is an AMD. Its maddening.
Fun game i like getting freaky and saying freaky
Cabra
mixed feelings either you're happy or you're mad but when you read (great enemy felled) you're happy anyway!
i dont have the game but its good
hard
Very good
Why is it always mushroom?
I loved the combat and how beautiful this game is. Including the the story once you understand it. Its just so flexible and you can make your character to anything you want.
i lov elden ring
GOTY 2022 was well deserved from Elden Ring. Everything from the combat, to the bosses, to the art direction of the game is a 10/10 for me.
yes
noice

One of the greatest games of the decade, dare I say ever. I had never played a souls game before I tried to game on launch (console) and I immediately fell in love with the genre. The exploration, combat, the story all come together to create an absolute masterpiece of a game. This game will 100% teach you to be patient especially if youre like me where you tackle problems in games by butting your head against at a brickwall. The sense of triumph and accomplishment is beyond anything any other game ive played has ever made me feel, and it is truly satisfying and fulfilling. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the souls series but is not sure bc of the difficulty. There are so many different ways to tackle every problem in this game, and if youre stumped on a boss? just come back later. Best of luck ye Tarnished, see yall in the DLC...
Cant rebind all keybinds....
I've beaten this game twice on Xbox and just began my PC playthrough. There is nothing like this game. Genuinely one of the best experiences of all time. There is a learning curve for sure that a lot of people aren't willing to sit down and learn. Be patient with yourself and the game. While you learn, have fun and enjoy the beautiful world of the Lands Between. Interact with amazing NPCs. Learning the game will come the longer you play and before you know it you'll be an Elden Lord. 

Please do not deprive yourself of one of the best experiences in gaming history.
There are very few games nowadays that I can say are worth the price. 
Elden Ring is worth the price and always will be.
this game made me smash my skull into a brick wall would recommend
amazing
Wonderful game, def the most welcoming to new players but I feel most gamers today aren't built for this
c coul
just awsome
FUCK MALENIAAAAAAAAAA IT IS NOT FAIR aside from that game is decent you know what fuck this game AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Killed some bosses, they killed me more.

A fantasy game with a big ass tree in the middle? Say less
hard, hard but fun and there are some builds that make the game even funner, and or easier.

My favorite game of all time! It has a vast and sprawling open world that is tons of fun to explore as well as difficult and unique boss encounters. Endless replayability with insane weapons, talismans, armor sets, and more that allow for an infinite amount of new and exciting builds. Also George R. R. Martin helped to create this masterpiece!
10/10
masterpiece!!!
One of the best games I have played. It is an experience that some may not get through but is so rewarding when completed.
good game but oh my god is it hard
Good game
I absolutely recommend this game. One of the BEST GAME I ever played so far. It's that simple
Loved everything, couldn't ask for anything better, but the dlc should be EVEN BETTER
No better game than this in the past decade.
htr
gud
Amazing game, even for first time soulsborne players! Absolutely recomend this game! 10/10!!!
One word : masterpiece
amazing game easily top 5 games ever made
I wish to wipe my memory to experience this game again.
This game to me is my modern Skyrim. Love the themes, the combat, the music, and piecing the story of the land together one odd story and conversation at a time. I love playing this game solo, I love playing it with friends, I love playing it with mods. Honestly I could not recommend this game enough. Even if (especially if) you're not a hardcore soulsborne player, this game has lots of fun and accommodations to ease the struggle, but then surely challenges you even using them. Large build variety (still wish bows were a bit better vanilla), ranging from easy to intentionally difficult, and plenty of fun ways to create your own challenge runs (no summons, no magic, etc). Seamless co-op mod makes this a proper multiplayer game to play with a friend or a few even (a few bugs but nothing unmanagable) and cause chaos across the land. My favorite part about this game is that anyone with sufficient patience and willingness to understand can complete the game.
sigma skibidi
It's alright.
I'd hit with Malenia but my pickle will rot away
Never knew I would enjoy being abused.
This game teaches you well. It is hard, but it gives you every chance to learn and gain power in various different ways (just leveling or player skill or gear or a combination).
fun
Dark Souls 4 of the wild
It's a great game honestly, slightly overrated when thoroughly looking at each section of the game, but still very good overall, 8,5/10. Mostly amazing bosses with a few annoying exceptions (Rennala, Magma Wyrm, Fire Giant, Elden Beast, Godskin Duo). Godskin Duo could've become an iconic duo fight like in previous FromSoftware games, but their concept was cheap (weird infinite respawns) and non-complementary to each other unfortunately, a wasted opportunity. Additionally, there were waaay too many recycled bosses. 

Last but not least, F*CK REVENANTS. F*ck their modelers, f*ck their animators, f*ck their designers, f*ck their audio engineers, f*ck their programmers, f*ck their moveset planners, f*ck their effect designers, f*ck their lore and f*ck everybody who was involved in creating that enemy. Go work for Valorant, Fifa or whatever the f*ck you want but stay out the fokin soulslike-kitchen, y'all are NOT cookin üò≠üò≠üî•üî•
You need YouTube and time to brace yourself.
cwl
üíç
Amazing game truly lives up to the hype.
Unbalanced game and more annoiying than Dark Souls.
+ Some locations are pretty and world mechanics are really good
+ Various enemies
+ Intresting boss fights, especially god enemies
+ Jump button is on another key than roll dodge
+ Cool animations for magic skills
- Torrent (useful, but hard to turn around and he die from lower distance when you jump from above than if you jump just as character)
- Basically, if you wanna do a decent damage you need to level up one thing to 60/80 so you may not play good melee weapons along with magic skills
- Too many things that are not necesaary to play souls game like crafting and ashes of war
- Open World game so you may consider spending a lot of time here, and sometimes grind souls for your character (but obviously grind spots are not easy, and you need to defeat some enemies and gather items, and the beggining leveling up character is hard until you get decent stats and weapon upgrades)
- Boss fights and camera tracing while you fight big enemies or those who are doing combat arts is very awful, you may not be able to dodge attacks as you could do without tracking // additionaly some of their attacks may hit you even if youre out of range
- Progression is very bad (again grind required, it is open world game so why not), cause you may get to location or boss fight you will not be able to win due to lack of mana or hp potions (i'm a fan of dark souls games 1-3, i had no big issues there)

I played a lot of hours in this game, but still i do not recommend this game. For me games should give us fun above all, but most of time i felt bad and annoyed playing it, just made my walktrough for achievements.
Play this game if you are very good in souls-like and you have a lot of patience.
11/10
GOAT
Best game on planet earth. Just remember, you're suppose to die in this game and don't give up very quickly. I can write million things on how this game is a piece of work. From Software never disappoints.

Slaughtering Malenia, Elden Beast and Fire giant for the second time was so rewarding. IMO Age of Stars is the best ending. Make sure you do Ranni's questline. I have never played a game this good like every aspect and attribute of it is a 10/10. Even million words would be less for me to express my feeling for this game. This game made me a true Souls Gamer. If you haven't played Elden Ring then you are doing the biggest disservice to the whole gaming community. Probably my favourite game of all time now. I am telling you best RPG ever, best Souls Game ever, best overall game of all time. I love god, I love life, I love Miyazaki fo rdirecting Elden Ring. From Software really proved how they are the best in the business.
Funny game




Big sword go !BONK!
a masterpiece i may have broken 2 monitors but it was worth it
gud game 100 %
very easy
:thumbsup:
Everyone loves this game, and i hated it at the beginning. I was so mad at myself, "Am i doing something wrong?" "These guys are way too op!" etc. Then at some point it all just clicked. I have not completed the game yet, but so far i love it. This might be the best game ever made (no exaggeration ;]).
great with convergence and seamless coop mods

At first I had no idea what to do in this game and barely played it but I always wanted to get into the game so I tried again recently and the game is very fun and for my first souls game I am obsessed with Elden Ring. There's so much to explore so if you like large maps you can free roam and fighting hard bosses, enemies, etc. in general you will very much love this game. The graphics are also very nice and detailed. 10/10 game for me.
irgendwie shit

this is EPIK! i really love getting mohgesd

I like boss, I just killed mohglester, now I am mohglester
good game
Fromsoft GOAT
Unreal game, almost perfection.

Dogshit boring combat. Any build that is 'fun' ends up making the game a joke. If the combat was tighter and more difficult this game would be a 10/10.
good game
Was my first souls game and I loved it <33 it really taught me how much of a masochist I am and how stubborn I am. If it's any indication Malekith and Malenia (after much trial and error) became some of my favourite bosses. Really loved the freedom and the depth that Fromsoftware puts into their games and their world building. Super excited to try some of their other games and the dlc that's coming out soon :)
Not for noobs
fun :D
fun (in the way that makes you slam your head against your desk)
good game
WEL
 I RECOMEND IT IF YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE
really amazing game

Cool Game
9.9/10 perfect game aside from malenia waterfowl dance :)
Is a fun but difficult game but if you use summons then it makes the game less fun and boring
It was my first Fromsoft game and i have to say it is one of the best games ive played in the last decade.
love it

Spent 50 Hours on a dog with OP Anime skills.

10/10 would get cokked again
First Fromsoft Game, So good I died.
Great game if your into lazy writing, no story and a quest line requiring you to find and go through doors hidden by to look like everything else..  Quit after 50 hours out of frustration and boredom.  This game has no redeeming qualities.
The best souls-like Fromsoft has made yet.  The world is fun to explore, and the enemies are great.
best game ever made
BEST GAME EVER MADE
game good

Good game, I personally think that some of the bosses are a tad bit gimmicky since they have so many one shot kills or grabs that deal like 80% of your health.
Rage inducing 10/10
fez is not good at this game
i cant make it past the stairs in the knowage cave my game frezes i have a 4080 rtx and i9 14900k idk why it keeps only freezing on that part it has been 2 day
yes
Try finger, but hole.
Funny wolf man
literally the best
very good
Just an amazing game just nothing else to say other than EVERYONE should give it a try

is good
too hard for me. im a little pussy. only play if u r patient and have too much time
Dog Pope in the game

The Goat
I busted a nut the first time i entered Leyndell.
already played through it on ps5 but got fed up with the ps+ bullshit just to play online once in a while... fuk sony and their greedy bullshit...
the game is peak from software masterpiece, absolutely recommended
got molested by a big ass snake with a human head, refunded the game, bought it again and got molested again

10/10 game
Masterpiece, struggle on.
very good, fuck rennala tho,she a bop
not a lot of hand holding to guide you where to go and what boss to fight. and if you are ready for the boss or not. especially when compared to the dark souls franchise. but overall one of the Goats in gaming history.
Challenging, gorgeous, complex, rewarding, compelling, sad, and intense.

Can confidently say that this game has minuscule hand holding. Be ready for despair.

Only advice is to explore everything and everyone. The full picture of the story is fractured into small, vague bits., 

If you are struggling, please call 1(887)-ERD-TREE. Know that you are not alone.


Damn wanted to get me a maiden turned out she dumps me and set herself on fire just to leave me
rump
best game mankind has ever created
Great
.
I love this game.
slow ass game, takes 19 years to go from point a to b
lalal

One of the best games of all time. Absolutely amazing, incredible, one of a kind. Sets a new benchmark for open world combat focused games. Only issue is mediocre performance, be sure your rig can run it. And don't you dare go hollow
best game yesyes
Where do I begin, A Journey into the Lands Between: My Love for Elden Ring

The world of video games is vast, diverse, and filled with countless adventures waiting to be experienced. Among these, one game stands tall, etching itself into the annals of gaming history: Elden Ring. This masterpiece, brought to life by the collaborative genius of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin, is more than just a game‚Äîit's an odyssey, a testament to the power of storytelling, world-building, and the intricate dance of challenge and reward. My love for Elden Ring is not merely about the hours spent in gameplay; it is about the profound impact it has had on my understanding of what a game can truly be.

The World-Building: A Living, Breathing Fantasy

From the moment I first set foot in the Lands Between, I was ensnared by its breathtaking beauty and the haunting desolation that permeates every corner. The world of Elden Ring is a tapestry of interconnected realms, each with its own distinct atmosphere, history, and inhabitants. The attention to detail in the environmental storytelling is nothing short of remarkable. Ancient ruins whisper tales of forgotten civilizations, while towering castles and dense forests invite exploration and promise secrets hidden within.

What sets Elden Ring apart is its commitment to organic world-building. Unlike many games that hold the player's hand, Elden Ring trusts its audience to uncover its mysteries at their own pace. Every location feels meticulously crafted, from the sprawling fields of Limgrave to the eerie depths of Nokron, the Eternal City. The seamless integration of lore into the environment encourages a deeper engagement, prompting players to piece together the narrative puzzle through exploration and discovery.

The Lore: A Mythic Tapestry

A significant part of my love for Elden Ring stems from its rich and intricate lore. The collaboration with George R.R. Martin is evident in the depth and complexity of the game's mythology. The story of the shattered Elden Ring and the demigods vying for power is a compelling backdrop for the player's journey. The lore is not spoon-fed; rather, it is woven into item descriptions, dialogues, and environmental cues, rewarding those who seek to delve deeper.

Characters such as Ranni the Witch, Godrick the Grafted, and Malenia, Blade of Miquella, are not just bosses to be defeated but tragic figures with their own stories, motivations, and downfalls. Their tales add layers of emotional depth and complexity, making every encounter meaningful. The lore of Elden Ring invites endless speculation and interpretation, fostering a community of lore enthusiasts who share theories and discoveries, further enriching the experience.

The Challenge: A Symphony of Difficulty and Reward

At the heart of Elden Ring is its gameplay, which strikes a delicate balance between challenge and reward. The game's difficulty is infamous, yet it is this very aspect that makes it so deeply satisfying. Each death is a lesson, each defeat a stepping stone towards mastery. The combat system is nuanced and precise, requiring skill, strategy, and adaptability. The variety of weapons, spells, and playstyles allows for a personalized approach, ensuring that no two playthroughs are exactly alike.

The sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming a particularly tough boss or navigating a treacherous area is unparalleled. Elden Ring respects its players, challenging them to rise to the occasion and rewarding perseverance with moments of triumph. This dynamic creates an emotional investment in the journey, transforming frustration into exhilaration.

The Community: A Fellowship of Tarnished

One of the most rewarding aspects of Elden Ring is its vibrant and passionate community. From shared experiences of hard-fought victories to the collective exploration of its lore, the community enhances the game in countless ways. Online multiplayer features, such as cooperative play and PvP invasions, add another layer of depth to the experience, fostering both camaraderie and competition.

Forums, social media groups, and fan sites buzz with discussions, theories, and fan art, reflecting the profound impact the game has on its players. This sense of community extends beyond the digital realm, creating a shared cultural experience that binds players together. The camaraderie felt when summoning a fellow Tarnished to tackle a challenging boss or the thrill of encountering another player in a duel adds a social dimension that enriches the solitary journey through the Lands Between.

The Art and Music: Aesthetic Brilliance

The visual and auditory artistry of Elden Ring is a feast for the senses. The game's art direction, with its gothic architecture, surreal landscapes, and grotesque creatures, creates a world that is as beautiful as it is unsettling. Each area is distinct, with its own palette and atmosphere, from the golden splendor of the Erdtree to the grim desolation of Caelid. The attention to visual detail enhances the immersion, making the world feel alive and immersive.

The music of Elden Ring, composed by Tsukasa Saitoh and Yuka Kitamura, is a hauntingly beautiful accompaniment to the game's epic scope. The orchestral score captures the grandeur and melancholy of the Lands Between, with themes that evoke both wonder and dread. The music enhances the emotional weight of key moments, from the quiet exploration of a forgotten ruin to the adrenaline-pumping intensity of a boss battle.

Personal Growth and Reflection

Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, Elden Ring has had a profound impact on me personally. The game's themes of perseverance, resilience, and the pursuit of knowledge resonate deeply. The journey through the Lands Between mirrors the struggles and triumphs of life, teaching valuable lessons about overcoming adversity and finding strength in the face of overwhelming odds.

Elden Ring has also sparked a deeper appreciation for the art of game design. The meticulous craftsmanship, the integration of narrative and gameplay, and the ability to evoke such a wide range of emotions are a testament to the medium's potential as a form of art. This appreciation extends to other games and has broadened my understanding of the creative possibilities within the world of gaming.

Conclusion: A Love Eternal

In conclusion, my love for Elden Ring is rooted in its masterful world-building, rich lore, challenging gameplay, vibrant community, and stunning artistic achievements. It is a game that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming, offering an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally engaging. Elden Ring is not just a game; it is a journey, an adventure, and a work of art that will continue to inspire and captivate for years to come. As I traverse the Lands Between, battling foes and uncovering secrets, I am constantly reminded of the magic and wonder that drew me to this world, and my love for Elden Ring only grows deeper with each passing moment.

Title: A Majestic Journey Beyond Imagination

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

As I sit by the fire, weary from the trials and triumphs of my journey through the Lands Between, I find myself compelled to share the wonder that is Elden Ring. FromSoftware has crafted a masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment; it's an odyssey into the depths of a world brimming with mystery, danger, and unparalleled beauty.

From the moment I stepped foot into this vast realm, I was entranced by its sheer scale and intricate design. Every corner of the map holds secrets waiting to be unearthed, whether it be the ruins of ancient civilizations or the lairs of fearsome beasts. The sense of discovery is intoxicating, driving me to explore every nook and cranny, eager to uncover the lore that binds this world together.

But Elden Ring is not merely about exploration; it's about the journey of self-discovery and growth. As I faced off against towering bosses and cunning adversaries, I felt myself growing stronger with each encounter. The combat is a delicate dance of strategy and skill, demanding precision and adaptability in equal measure. And yet, with perseverance and determination, even the most daunting foes can be vanquished.

What truly sets Elden Ring apart, however, is its storytelling. Through cryptic dialogue and environmental storytelling, FromSoftware weaves a narrative that is as enigmatic as it is captivating. Each character I meet, each lore snippet I uncover, adds another layer to the rich tapestry of the Lands Between. And though the plot may be shrouded in ambiguity, it only serves to deepen my intrigue, urging me ever onward in search of answers.

But perhaps the greatest triumph of Elden Ring lies in its sense of freedom. Unlike other games that confine players to a linear path, here I am free to forge my own destiny. Whether I choose to follow the main questline or wander off the beaten path in pursuit of adventure, the choice is mine alone. And in a world as vast and wondrous as this, the possibilities are truly endless.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a magnum opus that defies expectations at every turn. With its breathtaking world, exhilarating combat, and captivating storytelling, it stands as a testament to the boundless creativity of its developers. To anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure, look no further than Elden Ring. It is a journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll, a testament to the power of interactive storytelling.
This game has absolutely amazing graphics, perhaps the best of any game that I've ever played. That being said, I've never regretted buying a video game before. I do now. Elden Ring may be the most beautiful game that I've ever played, but it is also the single worst game as well. Over 3 hours in, and I still have no clear goal of what I'm supposed to be doing.

It's absurd that there's absolutely no quest tracker, journal, or other guidance in this game. For an open world game, this is unacceptable, especially for an open world game of this scale.
very good game
Perfect
Perhaps the best game ever made. Praise the sun.
ofc play this
Elden cringe
masterpiece
Amazing
Almost 1 million concurrents at its peak, what can I say that hasn't been already said?

10/10
Best Game Ever
Hey maybe before you release your dlc you fix the optimization. How is your game out for years and it STILL has a stuttering issue with never the same fix between two people?

Lazy.
800+ hours, thought id been everywhere and seen everything and some how there are still secrets to be found! this is possibly the best game i have ever played!
Best open world game I have ever played
i dont know whats easier this game or tic tac toe

(greatest graphics with amazing scene, world, and music design. bosses are challenging but rewarding and even if you have never played a souls game like myself, buy this game you will NOT regret it)
One of the greatest games ever made
Even though my computer has been on fire the past few days and i get about 20 mins of playtime before the blue screen of death this game is incredibly fun and i enjoy it immensely for a first souls game there is no better one.
fun for first soulsborne

terrible for first bosses
One of the best games created in a while
This is the closest thing we have to a perfect video game.

BEST GAME TO HAVE FUN BUT TO RAGE AT THE SAME TIME
ranni is bad as hell ngl 10/10
The game looks stunning and combat is pretty good but I still prefer Dark Souls 1. I just couldn't get into it the way a lot of others have. Get it on sale so you can afford the hospital visits after all the stress induced rages that will no doubt plague you during your play through.
I'm surprised my laptop can run it xd
W Game. I put my business on a complete halt in order to become an elden lord.
best game since legend of zelda oot
died to a massive shaft. 11/10 would play again.
good game only some dev thought it was a good idea to add a ginger giant that starts tweaking after u tickle his feet and thought it would be a fun experience
yay
awesome teehee !!!!
everyone is very mean and beat me up
sub 80 hour 100% lets goooo
games for ppl wit that dog in em n dont mind gettin they ass beat by everyone around them just to win once and go "im not fightin u no more"

This game deserved game of the year

open world format is amazing, graphics are insane and it still keeps the classic fromsoft yell at your computer difficult bosses for the story-line. well worth the money! 11/10
this game is so trash dont buy it if u want to have fun
It truly might be the best game I've ever played.
It's kind of easy compared to dark souls but worth playing regardless
Best game ive ever played in my life
Pretty hard at the start, you'll get used to it. Still a fun souls game though.
maidenless behaivor
good game

This is just the best game.

wanted to end it all 99 percent of the game but the final 1 percent made it worth
super large guy in a castle with a dragonhead instead of a hand that spits flames? yeah, recommended

edit: 20+ hours in, still strongly recommend even though the game sometimes makes me wanna kms
pretty good i guess
anyway BWAAAH BWAAAAAAAAH DUN-DUN-DUN DUN DUN-DUN-DUNBWAAAH BWAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Got one shot by a large red wolf wielding a giant sword 10/10 game üëç

Awesome
total dark souls knock off.
The Fat Godskin guy forced me to rethink my life decisions... other than that this game is somewhat of a masterpiece :I
<3
Darkmoon Greatsword goes brrrr
Love it, didn't finished it yet, maybe I'm to bad lol but still love it.
herion.
This game is my favorite game of all time. I don't know why, it just hits perfectly and I love it dearly. Can't believe I forgot to review it for so long.

This is the second platform i have bought this game for, ITS THAT GOOD

The first time i played this game was when i got this for Christmas and the only thing i knew was that it won game of the year. (I didn't even know it was a soulslike lol) 
I went in completely blind and for anyone who still doesnt know anything about this game, PLEASE DONT LOOK ANYTHING UP JUST TRUST ME ON THIS. This game is one of the best journeys i went through, and even though the game kicked my ass multiple times there will be no feeling better than finally killing the hard boss you have been stuck on for a long time.

TL;DR
I can't recommend this masterpiece of an game enough and nothing will feel better than finally overcoming the challenge you have been struggling with for hours. This game is a MUST PLAY.
Amazing game. Would be much better if it was all new, not bunch of reused animations, enemies etc. from previous titles. Still good tho but LOTF2 is way better imo. This game only wins in its map size, which is cool.
Looking forward for the DLC tho... #Crucibleaxedrip #Giantcrusher

Terrible compatibility problems trying to run this game in Linux.  I learned much to my dismay that the PC release has been malwared with EAC ("Easy Anti-Cheat").  Sickening when publishers do crap like this.  If you're going to bury this garbage in your game, you need to inform your playerbase CLEARLY before installation, and you need to put in an off switch.  I was not able to find either of those things.

Couldn't get it running under Windows 10 either.  I wish I hadn't played the 6ish hours on a struggling windows 7 machine, because then I'd be able to return this or sell it on.  Chalk up one more lose for digital distribution and AAA gaming.
it is good
good
if you don't get this game, you are maidenless.
I bought this game when it first came out but quit within the first hour because of the Tree Sentinel. Recently, I decided to give it another try, and after many hours of playing, I fell in love with it. This game is a true masterpiece. It tests your timing, skills, patience, and discipline. I give this game a 10/10!
May chaos take the world
nice
Good Game
this game sick, higly rexommande bro dont miss it
only spent 1 hour for customisation but best game ever, can't wait to die
Blue lady make me happy

It cured my erectile dysfunction. I went to the Steam Store as a last resort, my life was over. My wife was leaving me i was no longer a man, she was going to take the kids and the dog. I had no hopes and no dreams my life came to an end until one night while i was laying wide awake i look to the Steam Store for help and i found it thank you for all the help i was able to receive from this game. The moment i downloaded it i gained an instant erection, and full of testosterone i made love to my wife and now 3 months later we are having a 3rd kid thank you for this game.

In realms where legends wake and dreams unfold,
Elden Ring stands, a masterpiece of old.
A world reborn in shadows and in light,
A testament to art, both fierce and bright.

Its vast expanse, a marvel to explore,
Each corner whispers tales of ancient lore.
From soaring peaks to dungeons dark and deep,
Elden Ring's wonders, in our hearts, we keep.
Try Finger, But Hole

10/10 do recommend.
Crashes, very unstable game. locked at 60fps. No ultra wide. Cant compare items in the shop with your current inventory. 
Its like runescape quality, but good combat so far.
ok
I hated this game when i first started and could say that it took some time to learn.  I had some small outside help from friends and got the right sword/ build in my hands and it changed this whole game for me.  I now am deep in and enjoying the game so much and am glad that i stuck it out.  Great game.  So much to do and the amount of detail and love that went into it is amazing.
ranni's questline makes me want to kill myself
Buy
I keep dying and i keep getting frustrated but i literally cant put the controller down
good gamw like
Outstanding game!  I have put 200 hours into the game and I'm still hooked... just sayin.   Very challenging but very rewarding!
Got stuck on some random optional mini-boss for like an hour and then beat a big story boss in 2 attempts... amazing!
Excellent j'aime trop jouer maintenant
A deserved Game of the Year. Really fastsinating. I wouldn't have thought that this game couldn't make me play it 24/7.

Reconmend it to everyone how loves open world exploring and medium to hard boss fights
i a great game but tough be prepared to die a lot before you get good
I am in search of the shmelden bing
best game ever 

worth it
Game is so fun, but my mental state is also lowering
Very nice open world. Amazing terrain.
Good game. Just a little bit difficult.
What more can be said about it. I think the only game I've ever played that felt this great and exciting to play was breath of the wild. Takes all the best of the souls games and adds open world exploration. TBH I do not like open world, but this world is more dense than most - the amount of content here is staggering.
dog
peak
Elden Ring is a game of the ages, it will go down as one of the best games of all time. You will not regret playing this game as it provides every feeling one wants to give you a sense of true adventure.
Never felt worse about myself in my life. Best video game of the decade.
So I've tried to play this game for some time now...but every session since the start I've tried to play this game, I have been experiencing this game crashing every 10 minutes or so.  I have an AMD 6900xt GPU with 32GB of ram and an intel 14700K processor.  I am not experience any of this with any of my other Steam games like Last Epoch, BDO, D4, Guild Wars 2, Grim Dawn, etc... and I could go on as I've played quite a lot of games.  No crashes at all plaything those games as they run smooth, but this game constantly crashes.  I tried getting support on the official forums but the community there has been VERY RUDE saying this is somehow a problem with my own PC and not the game itself, when ELDEN RING is the ONLY GAME that is crashing!  Like give me a break?!  Horrible, HORRIBLE experience with this game.  It is unplayable with the constant and consistent crashes.  I do not understand why or how this game was so popular with these BUGS still in this game unfixed.
My first Souls game. If you're new to the Souls game, it may take some time to adjust to the mechanics, but once you do, you'll love it. Map is enormous. Gorgeous views. Exploring the wild will always surprise you. Music score is magnificent. Man I can write a whole article to tackle how great this game is but i only have time to play games. You have to experience this in your own. Go buy.

Meh.
Made me suicidal
Hard but fun
To many  hot chicks, get me distracted, dies, closes game, Melina rule 34.

honestly dont know anyone with enough free time to enjoy this game. I acknowledge it may be due to a skill issue, that being said make videogames for people who suck and they wont leave bad reviews. I regret paying money for a game that i wont play much.
I keep dying but its a good game
i love this game
one of the best games ive played in my life
game of the year
So good
This game would be 10/10 if that stupid ass boss called the fire giant was removed
DS2 Better
good
I don't know how this game is so big and popular but it does not work. I was really excited to play but no matter what I did to troubleshoot the problem the game would not work. I would get the white screen and then black screen where it would get stuck. No matter what I did or settings i changed nothing fixed it. Really disappointed. I heard the game was difficult and frustrating but I didn't know it was because you simply cant get it to run despite all the so called "fixes" that still didn't work.
one day.

Most beautiful game I have ever played

You'll get your skull smacked in from anything from a rat to a god, amazing game.
torrent is my goat
One my most favorite games of all time!
deserved game of the year
Never played a souls game but this is amazing.... played the story once journey 2 is next. Every tower you see there is an item/weapon/spell/incarnation/boss/talisman whatever. THERE IS SO MUCH CONTENT.
Never been more satisfied in killing someone/something before. Fucking masterpiece.
best game im ready for dlc
You Died!
W Game Real Fun Yeah Yeah
This game fills my pants a certain way a woman never could.

Fantastic, my first souls game and so far has been my favorite of them, and if you're into modding(make sure you are offline) the community is supportive and will help with that too overall amazing game

Great challenge and rewarding
Elden Ring, O Elden Ring
if only i had a giant,
but hole!
Epic
This game man.....quite possibly the best game ever made. The mere scope and world building that the creators made is the best of all time. Every environment is so drastically different and so incredibly beautiful, its like this is 3 games in one. $60 is an absolute STEAL for this. This is Art in its truest form and I commend everyone involved for creating such an incredible game. Also, MannyFresh is not an Elden Lord....he broke the game and cheated to get levels. Over-leveled and summoning everything he possibly could, he still struggled. Its a sad story my friends. If you see him on the street, tell him to jump off a cliff....its his favorite thing to do in games.
someone buy me this game pls

all this bull across each part of this gigantic map? is freaking hard. dont tell me get gud or something its either YOU go and kill a dragon, get killed by a dragon, get killed by a group of knights, killed by a gang of slobs, a giant walking lava spitting lizard and then giants thatll crush your spine or bonk you with a giant chinese bong symbol that you hit like a crash symbol thing--- GET BONKED ON or to correctly describe it, get dunked on
These are the 5 stages of Elden Ring:

> Buy the game all happy and ready to become lord
> Kill the bastard who called you maidenless
> Look ahead and see a man on a horse
> Die to the same man 10 seconds later
> Rage quit

Repeat
10/10

so much fun, lots of gameplay to be had.
Not bad
This game stands out as one of the best games I've ever played. It blends FromSoftware's challenging game play with an expansive beautifully haunting open world. It rewards your exploration and strategy with it's deep cryptic lore and great combat system. Stunning visuals and excellent soundtrack, it sets a new benchmark for open-world games. It's a must play for anyone looking for a challenge in a massive world!
Good open-world souls game.
you don't have the right Oh, you don't have the right, by the way you don't have the right, oh you don't have the right

FUCK THOSE LIZARDS AT VOLCANO MANOR, MORGOTT WAS EASIER THAN GRABBING SOMBER STONE 6
[h1] Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say fuck anyone who starts their comment like that (except me). This game deserves way better than cheap, lazy spam. [/h1]

I‚Äôve 100% completed Elden Ring on PS5, got the platinum trophy which was an absolute blast, and now I‚Äôm diving into it on PC. FromSoftware, you‚Äôve seriously outdone yourselves. Elden Ring is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's hard to imagine how you'll ever top this.

From the moment I stepped into this vast, mysterious world, I was hooked. The blend of deep lore, challenging combat, and stunning landscapes is just incredible. The gameplay is smoth and perfectly balanced, making every fight feel like a rewarding test of skill.

Exploring the world of Elden Ring is pure joy. It's packed with secrets, hidden paths, and lore that keeps you wanting more. The environmental storyteling is so rich that every corner of the map feels worth investigating. Each region has its own uniqie look and feel, so exploration never gets boring.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the only thing that annoys me: the catacombs or dungeons. This has been a problem since Bloodborne (my favorite game of all time). Even though Elden Ring does it better than Bloodborne, every dungeon still feels a bit like an AI-generated copy-paste job. But hey, they‚Äôre still fun.

The character builds you can create in Elden Ring are better than in any Souls game before it. Whether you‚Äôre into melee combat, magic, or a mix of both, the depth here is just amazing.

In short, Elden Ring isn‚Äôt just a game; it‚Äôs an experience. FromSoftware has set a new standard for the genre and maybe created a new genre, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what they do with the DLC. If you haven‚Äôt played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in. You won‚Äôt regret it.
I guess its cool
Might have entered the top 10 of all time boys.
10/10 game
gud game innit
kok and ball torture
nice
The last time I was this excited exploring a game world was when I first played Gothic 2 in early 2000s.
Hands down, must try game for any person that would call him/herself a gamer. Does not matter you like soulsbourne or soulslike games, this is the game that you must experience at least once in your lifetime.
best game
Great if you love a challenge and open worlds. Very fun and time consuming.
Big Bonks = Big Stonks Strength Build Is Best Build
PERFECT.
1 star. You can't look straight upwards.
OMG I LOVE Dark Souls 4!! This Dark Souls is open world and has amazing awesome graphics! Dark Souls 4 might be the best one yet!!! I am only 4 hours into Dark Souls IV but I know this one is gonna be a blast! Dakota sucks at Dark Souls 4 XD. Anyways thats my review Im excited for the DS4 DLC!
game of the century

Once you get all the NPC names straight in your head you'll finally be ready to take down the first boss.
cool game

GOOD GAME YEP
fire
dont get this game if your interested in leaving your home
DS1, 2 and 3: Boss attacks that conveys anticipation, buildup, momentum and follow through making bosses feel fluid and predictable enough for your eyes and brain to react to the animations while still challenging you.

ER: most boss attacks are so fast that you cant react to the animation of the attack, instead learning and understanding WHEN they are going to attack.  

Basically the Dark Souls franchise had really well conveyed attacks and momentum that can easily be dodged with human intuition. Elden Ring is the complete opposite because it makes the game way more difficult. 

I can't help but feel that the Dark Souls franchise was made to challenge you in a healthy way while Elden Ring was made just to be difficult. ironically enough falling into the same trap that Dark Souls 2 did (outside of the DS2 bosses)     

I can 1000% understand why people would love and adore this game but personally It challenges me in all the wrong ways

Thanks, i hate it
amazing

Very entertaining and was fun while I could play it
great great
The Two Fingers serve the Greater Will, i wonder if the Three Fingers serve another Outer God and the Flame of Frenzy is his symbol. Wonder if the Middle Finger of Hatred and Rudeness is a thing.
Well, to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion without being sentimental, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in distinct perspective and without condemning anyone's view and by trying to make it objectified and by considering each and everyone's valid opinion I honestly believe that I vividly don't have anything to say. Thank you.
This game is amazing both brutal and beautiful, what a masterpiece! Thank you fromsoftware for doing what you do DAMN good. 10/10
Just don't have any nice things around when you are stuck on a boss
I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. I have played over 1000 hours now and I have enjoyed every minute. I can't think of a game that I've ever gotten this much enjoyment out of.
I had initially gotten the game Spring of 2023. For the last year, I only had about 2 hours in the game. For whatever reason, this last week I decided to try again. One of my friends who has a lot more hours in the game than me helped give a little bit of guidance. Just enough to not feel so overwhelmed with all that this game has to offer. Now that I've got a better understanding, I can absolutely say this is a phenomenal experience. I probably can't give great feedback on the mechanics and whatnot, and there are probably far better reviews for that. What I will say is that I recommend getting some guidance if you're struggling with getting into the game. It's a steep learning curve, but such a good experience once you've got it down!
Best entry for new players in the series. The game is really really good. There is A LOT of content, one of the few games I enjoyed buying at full price.

Only problem is once you beat it once, the replayability isn't there. Like you know where everything is and you end up just riding your horse to the next spot and that sense of discovery is gone. You end up wanting a more linear story to go through like Dark Souls 1-3.
nice

I recommend if you like a challenge! Amazing game.

 In the vast expanse of gaming, few titles evoke the sense of anticipation and wonder quite like Elden Ring. Developed by FromSoftware in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, this open-world action RPG has been shrouded in mystery for years, with tantalizing glimpses leaving fans clamoring for more. Now, having traversed the lands of the Lands Between, I can confidently say that Elden Ring not only lives up to the hype but surpasses it in ways I never imagined.

At its core, Elden Ring is quintessentially FromSoftware. The punishing difficulty, intricate level design, and cryptic storytelling are all present and accounted for. Yet, within this familiar framework lies a world of unparalleled scope and ambition. The Lands Between is a sprawling, interconnected landscape teeming with secrets to uncover and challenges to overcome. From verdant forests to desolate ruins, each region is a testament to the game's meticulous attention to detail.

What truly sets Elden Ring apart, however, is its sense of freedom. Unlike FromSoftware's previous titles, which often felt claustrophobic and linear, Elden Ring offers players the freedom to explore at their own pace. Whether you're scaling a towering fortress or delving into a dark dungeon, the sense of discovery is palpable at every turn. This newfound freedom extends to the game's combat as well, with a wide array of weapons, spells, and abilities at your disposal. From visceral melee encounters to epic boss battles, every skirmish feels like a test of skill and strategy.

Of course, no discussion of Elden Ring would be complete without mentioning its enigmatic lore. Much like the works of George R.R. Martin, the game's narrative is rich with depth and complexity. From ancient prophecies to warring factions, the story of the Lands Between is as captivating as it is cryptic. Piecing together its various threads is a challenge in and of itself, but the rewards are well worth the effort.

Of course, Elden Ring is not without its flaws. The game's performance can be somewhat inconsistent at times, with occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-in marring an otherwise flawless experience. Likewise, the online multiplayer component feels somewhat tacked on, lacking the depth and polish of the single-player campaign.

Despite these minor shortcomings, however, Elden Ring stands as a towering achievement in the realm of gaming. It's a game that rewards patience and perseverance, challenging players to venture into the unknown and emerge victorious against all odds. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of FromSoftware's previous titles or a newcomer eager to experience something truly special, Elden Ring demands your attention. In the end, it's not just a game; it's an epic journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll.
best souls game without a doubt.

---
The note said "chest ahead" at the edge of a cliff with nothing in sight...there were plenty of bloodstains but they must've missed the jump... I had to be sure

Elden Ring was my first soulslike.
It was kinda overwhelming when starting but I had tons of fun in my first blind run.
Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game.
You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world, enjoy the view and smaller bosses.
The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in-game. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead.

For your information, I have played the game pirated before like 35h
Very nice :)
Pinnacle of gaming. Nothing will ever top it. One full playthrough on PC and 3 on PS5!
yes
Game not very fun. Big man on horse hurts. Cant sprint and dodge with different keys. Sad
SHEIN factory shift simulator
10/10
YOU DIED
Good game but I believe combat could be better.
Made by God.
awesome game
try but hole
Good and hard
It's Dark Souls but open world. This makes it way more approachable for new players because you can skip a lot of boss fights or more easily level up to overcome them--in addition to all of the other quality of life improvements compared to previous games. 

The world is also enormous and sprawling, and as a person who doesn't enjoy open worlds, it fatigued me really quickly sometimes. If you are looking to get into Souls games but share this concern, try out Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro. 

I also highly recommend the seamless multiplayer mod. Invasions have always been bullshit, and they only served to highten the fatigue I felt. The game did not need them, and I hope FromSoft considers removing this feature in the future.

This game has it faults mostly due to being a port over to PC, so expect your generic clunkyness in that regard. Game is capped at 60 FPS. Besides these faults, Elden Ring is a decently challenging game that offers you plenty of options to stray from a linear path. The open world allows for exploration and leveling with plenty of decent dungeons and bosses to get stuck into.  

So far, I have enjoyed my time on Elden Ring.
It's so awesome that i am addicted to the journey in Land Between.
The horse can double jump so I mean what else do you want man.
this game made me the most locked in ive ever been in my life brah
n1 but very hard to not die much :)
The graphics are great,
Map width is nice,
The items and music are very nice,
The only thing missing is Turkish language support,
Producers need to respect Turks and bring Turkish language support or Turkish subtitle support, urgently!

Thought I'd hate it given I'm a chill cozy game kind of person. This game consumed my life in spite of how far it was from my usual genres of choice. I wish I could play it for the first time again.
you can kill most npcs and it doesnt cause too many issues, and you can ignore the story fully. perfect

I recommed Elden Ring only because its just a cheap copy of the best game of all time DARK FUCKING SOULS 2. DO NooooT BUY FIFA 24 F EA  (fuck that game they ruined the only thing good abt it which is pro club with thier yee yee ass physiques nikmok a ea nikbabak l97ba schwanz studio)
epic
beat malenia in 2 attempts idk whats going on
late game bosses have a lot of buggy hitboxes and feel cheap, you're either chasing something running around or you're dealing with constant aoe spam
 brilliant game
Game and Lore is amazing and really deep. Challenging boss fights and cool fighting styles with all the different weapons. Don't let your friends tell the lore !
best game ever made 100% deserved goty

Never played any souls game.. And I'm hook, as a Witcher 3 player, the only thing I think is missing in this game is a bestiary, I would love to track the bosses I killed and read some lore.
its elden ring why wouldnt i recommend it
as a new player to the souls series as much as i wanna fucking split my head apart while fighting bosses i like it
I'm this far in and have no idea what the plot is. 

also, nice.
best game in the world. i will buy the dlc to later when i have money
masterpiece.
Best Game. (four handed blue chick)

YAYYYY!!! I LOVE THIS GAME !!!!!! LUV LUV MEOW <33333 ^_^
Negative review just to piss of all the souls shilling Andys. The games pretty good though.
190 hours of playtime to complete my 1st play through, i wasn't messing around and i'm also not a fromsoft newbie , i'm also certain i missed some bosses and other secrets. the game literally has more to offer than anything i'v ever played. it became a way of life and i shall remember it until my dying day. 

More agreeable than the souls trilogy for first time players. but in-depth enough for soulsbourne veterans too.
10/10 no question.
Im lost and don't know what to do with my life now I've finished.

If you have never played a fromsoftware game i would probably recommend starting with Dark souls 1, then moving onto Bloodbourne (if possible) then Ds3, and then Elden after. Just too fully appreciate the developers works. you wont regret the journey and good luck.

Simply put, this is a "must play" experience. 

The combat mechanics are so well designed it'll keep you playing for hundreds of hours. The landscapes, castles, dungeons, creature and boss designs are all artistic masterpieces. You will find yourself stopping to take in the vistas that the Lands Between offers. The game is a work of art all around and if you can embrace the challenge, you'll find one of the best gaming experiences ever created.
I'm not a die-hard souls-like fan, so this review is for people like me who are interested in the genre but never played one. Elden Ring is very likely a must-buy for folks who already enjoyed the previous FromSoftware games.It's hard for me to recommend this game, but in the end the positives outweigh the negatives. Most of my issues come from the fact that I don't like repetition very much. I do like roguelike/roguelites a lot, but there the repetition is not exactly the same every run. In souls-like games you have to go through the exact same areas with the exact same enemies over and over again.Let's start with the positives:[list][*]Exploring the open world is really fun and rewarding! There are a lot of hidden nooks and crannies with interesting gameplay.[*]Trying out the different weapons was fun.[*]For the most part the melee combat was fun and engaging, at least against small and medium sized enemies. I mostly blocked enemy attacks with my Greatshield and counter attacked, which staggers a lot of enemies directly or after a few successful counters.[*]The traditional souls-like death-and-progression-system works really well in this open world. If you are stuck at one point you can just go somewhere else most of the time. You have a lot of freedom where you want to go.[/list]Here are my negatives:[list][*]A lot of the bosses were not fun to fight against for me. Many are just big damage sponges and you have to roll out of their way constantly and chip away at their health one attack at a time before having to roll away again. This was tedious and not engaging for me.[*]Some boss fights appear quite sudden. If you have a lot of runes on you and get defeated (which for boss fights you will most likely lose your very first attempt), you have to go back to the boss fight, scramble to get your runes back and try to defeat the boss. This happened to me a few times and it's very frustrating. I know that Lies of P has solved this issue by simply putting the lost Runes/Ergo in front of the boss entrance, so you can choose if you want to continue or not.[*]I found it very tedious to get into the lore. Apparently you have to read item descriptions for that, which I did not expect was a requirement for exploring that part of the game.[*]I tried out some mage builds but that kind of gameplay was boring to me. You just stand at a distance and spam stuff. I got drawn to the game for the melee combat, so that's not that big of a let down.[*]There are some design decisions that could be way better imho, like the fact that Great Runes are kinda useless because you lose their effect upon death, and activating them costs items that you need to farm.[/list]But overall the game is very well crafted with interesting world building and mechanics. If you like challenging combat and open world exploration you should experience it for yourself! If you find constant repetition frustrating you should probably skip this.

Love this game.

Good game but the hardest shit i have ever played
500+ hours in and I just noticed the Table of Lost Grace site of grace...
BIG
Another masterpiece made by FromSoftWare. Among the games I have played, this game has one of the greatest map designs, lore, and one of the most beautiful scenery. And most importantly, the boss fights are absolutely amazing. It brings me so much joy after defeating some of the bosses. I literally screamed after defeating Radahn, Rykard, Malenia..... I hope they add an option that you can refight bosses after defeating them like in Sekiro. I still regret I didn't backup a save before defeating Malenia so I can fight her again without starting a new game. 
One thing though, I play with mouse and keyboard, and switching spells and items is rly ANNOYING! Not gonna lie, it makes this game a little harder. Sometimes I have to f**king switch 5 times to get the one I want. Oops, scroll past it, gotta scroll it again. hell yeah! 
Finally, who said a man cannot kill a god? who said a tarnished cannot be a lord? To all the Elden Lords!
Give it time. Starts off very difficult but it gets addicting quickly.
no bishes
Very nice game, but its hard to differentiate dogs from turtles.
Fantastic, everything you have ever heard about this game is true. It is a masterpiece that still holds up years after release!
Madness.
Game of the Year indeed! 

Worth to buy even the full price!
what even happened?

This is a certified Bruce classic!

One of, if not my favorite game of all time. Everything about Elden Ring is absolutely perfect. Opened me up to all of FromSoft's other games as well and haven't looked back. Nothing else compares.
its been 2 years since this game has came out. back when i was on ps5, converted late last year to pc, ive been wanting to play and get into this game, the detail in videos, and the joy on people faces and the challenge.... just have never tried to get into it, fast forward two years, kai cenat is doing his 100 plus hr stream. if kai outta all people is going through and making a series on it, i had to jump on it. even though the multi player isnt wht people want. there are simple mods for it. that work perfectly. this game is a masterpiece. and am going to love to challenge of this game
Legitimate masterpiece
i like
Cant stop.
GOAT
its a cool seat
Elden Eing was one of the first games that I ever 100% on console. Now trying it on PC and its even better.
Game of the year deservedly. No paid-for reviews necessary, it earned all its accolades by merit. Beautifully crafted masterpiece.
one of the best soulslikes ive ever touched in my existence.
Great game, but modders deserve game awards not developers who make horrendous PC ports.
GG
good
it's amazing.
W game

I really like it
if elden, must ring.

very yes much skibbitty
10/10 this game is incredible
its really good nice graphics and i like it i reccomend its very good the gameplay so cool
Really awesome game kai introduced me to it
I can't put my foolish ambitions to rest. Put over 200 hours into my first play through and just started a NG+ before the DLC.
it is good
best game ever made 

Keeps reminding me that I‚Äôm a maidenless fool. 10/10
could be a little bit harder
Teaches lots of life lessons. 10/10
nicely epic

FromSoft at its finest. This is my personal favorite game.
it's alright i guess but ds 2 better

A complete game by all standards. I was immersed in it to an abnormal degree. It entered my top 5 list of games, and this is a very rare and even appropriate thing.
Consider it your gateway to the world of Souls games
big stick
chud shit
cant sex dung eater
Great Game!
this games too fucking hard
What can I say about ELDEN RING other than it's a pure masterpiece. 

Whether that be the outright masterful music composed, to the overpowered bosses that take you several attempts (Personally that was Morgott), you will never know what to expect to miss on your first attempt or even your second.

If you're wanting a souls game to start with I would recommend ELDEN RING without a Shadow of (the Erdtree) a doubt. 100%ing this game took me a long time but I enjoyed every single attempt in getting there. 

Cannot wait for the DLC to come out (Also please bring bloodborne to PC)

Overall Score 12/10
Amazing game, bathed in rays of gold.
very good and the game is gigantic.
this game is perfect......just the world alone is breath taking so much to do its like there is always a new spot to discover the bosses are supper hard and have broke me down.....BUT the feeling when you finally beat them is amazing and you feel accomplished        10/10 game would recommend
i love boss
There's no way this path leads to another damn map the size of the original Dark Souls.

OH MY GOD
I've unveiled deep rooted anger i never knew existed, in just 3 hours of playtime on this shit. will continue to play until i've torn all of my hair out
Absolute masterpiece. SO INCREDIBLE. This game will have you entertained every second with its never ending open world experience and THRILLING combat. I've had Elden Ring on my Xbox before getting it on steam and after how ever many times I have finished the game, I've never been so excited to start again every time. I always love finding new things to explore and new swords and spells to use. OUTSTANDING. I always have such a great time playing it after every time I hit "start".

I am no longer maidenless. Praise the message!
very hard very scary very fun
its dope

Very good game play. Story is cool cause you have to slowly put it together.
It hurts so nice i love elden ring
Its strange.. The first 10 hours of this game I repeatedly said "f*ck this game". I decided to stick with it and somehow by the end, it is one of the greatest games I've ever played. 10/10
One of THE best games I've ever played. From the setting to the bosses, characters, weapons, music, and landscape. Everything is really well put together and while the main story is not the greatest ever, the "hidden" lore makes up for it by a good margin. If you got a bit of time on your hands and want to get absolutely stomped on your first try. THIS is the game for you.
Yes.
game good
its fine

the best game ever great story great game play the best ever made

Awesome game with good mechanics and lots of play styles. It is super rewarding to learn how to survive and beat the crazy bosses.
i got gud
just GREATTTTTTTT
Fun, Not Fun, FUN, not fun
This game makes me happy. It can be a bit repetitive at times but it is a great entry to the souls series and I cannot over state how excited I am for the DLC to launch.
Most complete game i have ever played.
bonk build gud, gam gud 10 of 10
Elden ring is awesome

yaya
[h1] In short, Elden Ring [/h1]
So, the latest [b] Souls Like [/b] game from Miyazaki.
The game is very good, really addictive, but only if you play without guides.
The game has an open world, a lot of quests and quest lines of characters, as well as a large number of bosses, namely more than 80, if you take into account mob bosses and just bosses.
The game has very beautiful graphics, all textures are well made, the picture is even on weak PCs [spoiler] I mean those PCs on which it can be played at all [/spoiler]
But there are also disadvantages, namely the traditional online, in which you can not normally play with friends.
Of course, this can also be fixed with [spoiler] Seameless Co-op [/spoiler]
The bosses are very diverse, from the usual soldier mob, to the well-known Malenia or, for example, other famous bosses.
There are several locations in the open world where you can find various things.
There are a large number of weapons that can be found, obtained and used.
Due to the variety of powerups, weapons and armor, builds are still appearing and stronger builds are appearing each time.
If you have already passed the game, and do not know what to do, there are several options that you can notice for yourself
1. Go fight with other players in the colosseum.
2. Install  mods on the game [spoiler] you can get banned [/spoiler]
3. Set yourself a complication in the form of, for example, passing the game by pumping only one characteristic, using only bows or crossbows, or without pumping.

Also, this game has an extensive community that can both support you and condemn you for playing or using something they don't like, for example.

The most important thing is to complete the game the way you want and like it the most, and not pay attention.

I hope my review helped you with the choice of the game.

Good luck and have a good game

Phenomenal game
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH" - Godrick the grafted
dear god
the games fun but worse than dark souls in all the ways that matter, boss fights that consistently punish aggressive play and skill cap the player into a patience game, bloated overworld, recycled enemies, inferior pvp systems. its still an amazing game but im leaving a negative review because i hope this isnt the future of fromsoft games

edit:
idk im still playing the fk out of it so i guess the game owns
Skill required ahead
Its okay.
 Just kind of boring and monotonous. If you've never played a souls game, or you're a souls-fanatic that can never get enough of the same formula, then you'll probably like this game a lot. Otherwise, it's essentially a uninspired repetition of the same ol' that From Software has been doing for over a decade now. 
best game
i would fuck this game if i could
if you enjoy suffering in a beautiful landscape filled with horrors beyond imagining, this is your game!
second best game of fromsoftware

GOATED Gameplay
very good game, im not that far but its cool

elden ring is a beautiful game with a lot of different weapons for different play styles you wil definitely find the weapon that suits you the most the map is huge and the bosses are fun an hard you can get mad but once you have beaten the boss you get the best feeling you will ever have if you are done with the game you can play hit again on new game plus in new game plus the enemys have more hp and do more dmg and if you are bored if the PVE what i don't think will happen you can also PVP with other real players there a a lot of story lines that you can follow to get some cool weapens i definitely will recommend this game for anyone who likes hard game.
[u]Recommended.[/u]
[list]
[*]The bosses are not as tightly designed and satisfying to fight against as in Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne; 
[*]The world altogether is not as atmospheric, cohesive and balanced as Dark Souls 1 world; 
[*]The open world is beautiful to look at, but slightly too big;
[*]"Legacy Dungeons" (DS style areas) are expertly designed highlights of the game;
[*]PvP is not as varied as in Dark Souls 2 [i](very few "meta" builds - nearly half of Colosseum encounters are against the same 3 builds + no stamina management required whatsoever)[/i];
[*]Jump and crouch feel a bit better than in Sekiro;
[*]NPCs are still just teleporting vending machines, but this time in a much bigger world so they're easier to miss;
[*]The difficulty is all over the place. It will depend on the order in which you do things, and on your willingness to use all the tools at your disposal;
[*]The lore is not as dark fantasy as in previous games, it's more akin to a grotesque high fantasy soap opera;
[*]Art, soundtrack and voice acting are top notch, as usual;
[/list]

Whilst it doesn't bring anything new to the table for experienced DS players, it does have a lot of content, spectacle, and it's just more Dark Souls, which on the whole is a good thing.
very good game
SO AMAZING I CANT EVEN COMPREHEND THE AMAZINGNESS OF THIS AMAZING GAME ITS NOT ELDEN RING ITS AMAZING RING
SHIT GAME
I'm just gonna go ahead and say what we've all been thinking

If you didn't play the other FromSoftware games, you don't deserve to play Elden Ring

I am tired of you bandwagon sheep frauds trying to hop on this. BUT MY FAVORITE GARBAGE YOUTUBER IS PLAYING ELDEN RING SO I WANNA PLAY IT TOO - no. I'm so sick of you bandwagoning frauds coming out of the wood work to ride a train after we built it

Stay in your lane, your gta lane your fortnite lane your among us lane

Where were you in 2010 with demon souls ? When you were made fun of for playing dark souls?
Best game ever made
may the frenzied flame guide you
this game is unable to beat rating 0/10
One of those games that you absolutely have to play before you die.
Goated game.
Easily my favorite of all the Soulsborne games, mainly due to the open world aspect, and the fact that after 6 playthroughs there is still plenty of secrets and lore to discover.
Playing this game made me feel like an medieval knight, it also made me feel like aids for making me die for over 100 times on one boss
Haha big sword go brrrr
Death is fun
balls and pp rock hard rn
OOOH DEATH BECOME MY BLADE ONCE MORE
gras
MASTERPIECE !
Over 800 hours and likely will jump up to over 1000 hours when the DLC hits.  The game like all souldborn games from Fromsoft is absolutely amazing.
JUST A ''BOMBOCLAT'' FROM ME
very good
found a message that read
"fort,
night"
And another next to fia that read "Still no head"
10/10 game would play again
Best game. Very good.
goty every year
ta weno
It's alr ig
Elden ring is one of the very few games I would say is a perfect 10/10 for what it sets out to do. The bossfights are challenging and fun to learn, and the world feels like FromSoft wanted you to explore every single nook and cranny in the expansive map. As this is my first soulsborne game, I had a lot of problems learning the feel of how a bossfight is supposed to go, but once everything eventually clicked, the fights became more akin to a puzzle that requires a high level of execution to beat. And while I'm still not a pro at this game that has beaten the whole thing at level one, It has always been fun to go through playthrough after playthrough with different weapons to see how much I have improved. This game, while difficult, thoroughly rewards players who stick with it and are willing to learn from their mistakes. 

The only issue I have with this game is the multiplayer system, and I'm well aware the problems I have with it are a soulsborne staple. The mutiplayer system for pvp, while pvp isn't really my thing, is fine, but the co op multiplayer being based on only being at bosses is kinda annoying to me. I wanted to treat this game as a multiplayer game when I first bought it on PS4 (about 200 more hours), but Elden Ring really isnt set up that way, with exploration being mostly a singleplayer activity. BUT, with the help of the Elden Ring Co op mod, I've got exactly what I was looking for, which has lead to about half of the total Elden Ring played hours on my PC. 

So, all in all, phenomenal single player game, and if you don't mind mods, a phenomenal multiplayer game as well. Shadow of the Erdtree can't come soon enough.

Best Game
Play this if you're willing to go through the best world-building and exploration from any game, while also suffering through the most inconsistent difficulty in the 'souls-like' Fromsoft series.
This game got me playing Dark souls 1 Dark souls 2 Dark souls 3 And sekiro. 10/10 game.
I had a hard time getting trough the first half of the game, until i got the moonlight greatsword and now the game is a little easier. Great game would change my build again
everything
good gmae
Hard :(
I don't mind dying from skill issues. Getting killed by an instant kill room mechanic that changes it's function for no reason; that's just the game doing random things to kill you just because. Not my kind of fun. I'm also not a fan of having to go back to where you died to pick up your stuff in this game. Not because its tedious or a bad mechanic, but after dying from random out of combat stuff, its not really fun for me having to traverse back and forth avoiding it all again just to collect my shiz. I'd rather fight enemies. Not run away from giant rolling death machines that stick to a pattern; then for no reason they change direction because why not?

Also, is it supposed to be fun to get on your horse and run past just about every enemy in the game to go collect everything? Instead of fighting your way through enemies to earn your rewards... all you have to do is bypass everything with your horse to collect all sorts of loot/gear/keys/spells you name it. New area you just discovered full of enemies? no problem!, get on horse and run. Dragon just land out of nowhere on top of your head, no problem!, get on horse and run. 1/2 of all the weapons in this game you can get by avoiding all the enemies with your horse without having to engage in any combat. Yay! horse riding collecting simulator! Just look online on how to, "get OP early". You can spend hrs in this game getting stronger by just running all over the map avoiding everything to acquire end game lvl gear....No thanks.

I will acknowledge that just about everything else in this game is amazing. Content and character build theory crafting is super fun. The combat is ok. I'm not a huge fan of the dull music, but it does fit the atmosphere and feel of the game so i give it a pass. Being said; you won't be feeling, "epic" from the music anytime soon.

People say this game can be hard. I assume they must be confused on how to steer the horse.
1500 hours played (on different accounts) and I can't stop. Help me
tough love

If not the best, one of the best games I've ever played ngl
I love this game.

I am a huge Darksouls fan and can confidently say this is my favorite FromSoft souls game. I like this game so much that when I switched from PS5 to PC, I decided to break in Elden Ring on PC for the up and coming DLC. I platinum'd EVERY Souls game they made on Playstation, so its only natural to want to continue that trend on PC, too. (Currently still playing and enjoying, so I do not have all achievements yet.)

- That is a take away that separates this Souls game from others, however. Getting all achievement in this game is kinda hard to NOT do when all you have to do is play the game how you want. Hard to mess it up.
- The bosses in the game are arguably HARDER than other souls games, but they put in Ashes to help you with the fights (Mimic Tear, my love). And if that doesn't work, use a yellow pellet and call in some reinforcements from other Elden Ring nerds playing, which 9/10 times you'll end up beating the boss this way because there's a decent amount of good players that enjoy helping out.
- There's no upgrading armor in this game, some may not like that, but i like not having to put souls into upgrading MORE of my stuff when i can be using the souls to upgrade my stats.
- You do still upgrade your weapons, however. There's a vast sea of different options to choose from and I enjoy the versatility and variety. i always try to build my character a different way on each NG+
- New player friendly (lol). it's a souls game after all. they were kind enough to make a "tutorial" for you, which is nice. But that is only after you get spanked by a crazy looking creature that nightmares are made of. Extra arms for extra spanks. 
- For all the turtle bois that hide behind shields, you're in luck. They added a feature where you can essentially "counter" when something hits your shield. Does a fair amount of damage, it's like a fully charged heavy attack.
- Plus many other positive things I can say about the game, but i want to wrap this comment up.

So, whether you want to get into a souls game or you're a veteran souls player like me, I highly recommend this game to all gamers out there.
big swords
this game is ass, would reccomend
Become Elden Lord. What else is there to say?

I hate mohg

GOTY.
yes
Well deserved game of the year, probably the best soulsborne game, next to sekiro and bloodborne.
Instant classic
i thought it was bad at first 
BUT NAH THIS AMAZING

ranni
One of the greatest games you'll ever play. Even if you are not a fan of other Souls-like games, I highly recommend Elden Ring. Yes, the game is difficult, and you will die a lot, but there is no shame in it. The struggle in the early part of the game is a necessary, and satisfying one in the long run (keep in mind you only get stronger as the game progresses, though so do enemies). The lore of this game is incredible, and it is worth playing simply to learn about the history of the world and characters of this game, and all its mysteries. The game is about a lot of things, but ultimately it is the satisfying journey of starting as a weak character who can barley fight more than a few foot soldiers without dying and then eventually building up your skills, finding new weapons and armour in your travels across the world, uncovering secrets, and slaying not just the foes you used to struggle against, but literal Demi-Gods. 
the game is also super fun with friends. the PvE arena is a blast, and I highly recommend the Seemless Co-Op mod for playing with your friends (without having to summon each other in different boss areas, and no Invaders. a much more fluid multiplayer experience)
Bro i have no idea wht to do there is no tutorial i am refunding staright away
This game is genuinely incredible. It is amazing how massive this game is, and all the content and questlines you can explore and bosses waiting for you to defeat. The lore is incredibly interesting to, it's a very interesting story that shows itself more as you progress. It does have it's flaws, like poor balancing in the last half of the game and reused bosses as well as very strange design choices for some bosses; but ultimately I walked away genuinely satisfied and I do not regret a single hour I spent in this game.
The Foreskin Duo made me feel things that I never thought I would.

Hell yeah, everyone shall play this masterpiece
Favourite atmosphere from all games ive ever played
Imma glaze this mf, i give it 10/10 in every department
"Elden Ring" offers a stunning open world and challenging gameplay that rewards patience and strategy. Its graphics are impressive, and the combat system is complex, demanding careful thought and perseverance. The story is cryptic and engaging for those who enjoy piecing together lore. While its difficulty may deter some, "Elden Ring" is a rewarding experience for gamers seeking a deep and immersive adventure.
yes
Beware
i died 1000+ times. can confirm is an incredible game. play it
in my top 10 games

fiya
This game was made to make u quit, but if you dont it feels so good to prevail. this game i shonestly so fun and definetly one of my favorite games
This game can be tough, but the one thing to remember is Fort night, and Try Jump Ahead.
Goated
 [h1]Overall 9/10 for me. one of the best games of all time. [/h1]

-The incredible art style and world that has been created here is nothing short of mind blowing. On my first play through i was in awe at how the map just kept opening up over and over again.

-An insane variety of weapons and play styles, making for almost endless replayability

-more accessible than any other game in the franchise. If you are stuck there is almost always a way to make the situation easier.

Cons: 
-Game could have been 30 percent smaller and trimmed some of the fat. there are some bosses that are reused way too much
-Lacks drop in/drop out multiplayer (as all souls games do)
-some performance issues in certain game areas
17.3 Hours played on my first time playing it. Yeah, it's good.
Wormface weirds me our but other than that its kinda good ig

I started playing fromsoft games back in the 90s with kingsfield. They never disapoint. Elden Ring set the already high bar on a whole new level. Beautiful game, you can spend hours just looking at the scenery. Open world challenging and rewarding game play. I have 250 hours in this game with multiple newgame+ and I'm looking forward to starting again to get ready with a new character for the upcoming DLC.
complete this game and you will find out ..
Sidestep, buttstab. Very good.

Great game, one of the best I have ever played!
In a society where technology reigns supreme, I found myself navigating the complexities of parenthood as a 50-year-old corporate executive with a passion for classic literature. My daughter, a 16-year-old tech-savvy whiz, was always glued to her devices, immersed in a world that seemed light-years away from my own.
One day, she came home with a new game she had discovered online. As she dove headfirst into this virtual universe, I couldn't help but feel a pang of isolation, longing for a way to connect with her in a world dominated by screens and algorithms.
Determined to bridge the gap between us, I mustered the courage to explore this foreign terrain by creating my own gaming profile and immersing myself in the game that had captured my daughter's imagination. As I navigated the virtual landscapes, I felt like a fish out of water, struggling to grasp the mechanics and intricacies of the game.
Turning to my daughter for guidance, she eagerly offered to be my mentor, patiently teaching me the ropes and sharing her expertise. With her guidance, I slowly but surely began to find my footing in this digital realm, discovering a newfound sense of camaraderie and understanding with my daughter.
Our roles reversed as she became the teacher and I, the student. Through shared victories and defeats, we forged a bond that transcended generational barriers, finding common ground in the unlikeliest of places.
This game became our shared sanctuary, a place where words were unnecessary, and actions spoke volumes. It opened the door to conversations we had never thought to have, fostering a sense of closeness and mutual respect that had eluded us in the fast-paced world we inhabited.
As we ventured through virtual quests and conquered digital foes together, I realized that the true treasure lay not in the pixels on the screen but in the moments of connection and understanding we shared. This game became a bridge that spanned the divide between us, reminding me that in the vast expanse of the digital landscape, the most valuable treasures are the bonds we forge with those we love.

Not for me...game looks good but this feels like a game you need to be a hardcore grinder to play..I just run around looking at flowers and the trees because I don't know what to do and I am so bad at this type of games ;( I prefer shooting games or games with a good story.

One of my favorite games of all time even if it makes me want to bash my head into the wall i cant help but coming back for that wall over and over im also terrible at the pvp but its still fun.
Very overhyped. Under delievering. Will maybe change it in the future. Till then just play Dead Island 2.
Absolutely no indications, the UI is 2006-style, the game is dodge simulator (you can only attack in 2 ways anyways), too damn difficult (but that can be maintained if you run away from EVERYONE). I don't know, I don't see the point, the story is mediocre, the character doesn't talk, fights are only dodging, the controls and menu are SO DAMN OLD and SHITE.
I like this game because is fun !

best game i have ever played
Oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect! Everything, down to the last, minute details.
fye
Since started playing this game I am no longer maidenless.
Game is good, you should buy it.
Could be harder.

But please never stop letting Miyazaki cook.
This game almost made me die irl, but it was totally worth it.
goated asf
Totally recommend. Elden Ring is life changing experience.
dog ahead
gud

I decided to play this game merely on a whim. After just under 70 hours of doing everything but before an important part that changes whenever you did something optional or not, I can say that this game was rather fun.

I hate open world games man. 
I don't want to miss anything while playing a game but also don't want to play with a live map on my second screen, it ruins the surprise and immersion.

For the love of god let future installments of the fromsoftware games keep to the classic linear style game layout.. like Sekiro :)
FromSoft can't be touched by any other developer
good game but i now dislike the word trey
a beautiful world and challenging bosses, overall really really good!! 

Incredible game 8/10

I'll just dodge

Kill a dragon and eat its heart.
best game
Once you find your build, play style, and pass the level barrier, the game isn't that hard. Yea I die all the time still over stupid reasons, but that's every game I play. You'll figure it out kid.
This game made me coom before a woman could.
buggy keep crashing

its like gta but elden ring
w game with mods
oooohh elden ring
Reach boss. It kills you. And it kills you again. You die again. You loose faith in yourself. You kill the boss. Its the best game again.
good game :)
Lots of (not) fun. Really loving the game
rotussy
My favorite part of this game is where I get to exist for about 2 minutes before being thundercunted all the way back to a door and grabbed and sent straight into a giants asshole.

It's Dark Souls, just without the dark, or the souls part, and if they added the words Elden, and Ring.
Great game, terrible in-game interface.
:)
üîõüîù
I have played and beaten all the souls games, including the original Demons' Souls on PS3. I love these games and I appreciate the devs for making these games. Now I know this isn't a *souls* game in name but it pretty much encompasses all the same gameplay that those games had plus some open world stuff.

Elden Ring is the worst of all the Souls games because of the open world. You'll end up destroying countless bosses because there is no way to balance this kind of game. Let's not forget all the copy and paste bosses you fight as well. This game may have the most spells, the biggest lineup of bosses and enemies, the largest world.... but it's all just padding on top of padding. I almost couldn't finish the game because I was getting so bored and I have absolutely no urge to do a NG+ either.

These types of games are meant to be first and foremost DUNGEON CRAWLERS. Getting through dungeons and figuring out traps is most of the fun in these games. The dungeons in this game are mostly half baked. The music is nowhere near as good as previous entries either.

Is this a bad game? No. But does it deserve a higher rating than DS1, DS2, DS3, Demons Souls? HELL NO.
Kai it took me 16 hours to beat elden ring, dumbass
–¢—ã –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ–µ—à—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ ,–æ —Ç—ã –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ–µ—à—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ .
Hands down best game i every played
game is so awesome sauce
i am the elden lord
This game FUCKS. I'm a firm believer now in the idea that you get what you earn. No hand holding, just fully dominating and winning against the truly skilled NPC. I've cheated, lied, and mirrored my way to an ending but by golly I made it happen.

I still feel blessed for the stuff I did beat, and now I'm going around the world again doing it for real. I'm losing all the time but at least I'm sticking to my principles!!!

This game is a serious net positive for everyone. Good job FROMSOFT!!
Es bueno
If you want to jump right into action, Elden Ring is the way to go.  Though it does have some story and cut scenes, much of the deeper lore is hidden in item description.  Though this game is not for the faint of heart, it will test your skills as a gamer.  No one way will always work for you, but finding what works best for you will give you good results.  Sometimes you have to be rash and quick, other times you have to be patient and still.  Up to you to decide when.  You can make the decision in the vast world with friend and foe alike.  Keep up your guard, for there are certainly more foes out there.  Many enemies big and small are ready to get in your way and change up the way they fight if you fail.  Solve puzzles in dungeons and craft items for restoration/buffs or throwables for combat.  Many weapons to choose from of different weapon types.  Find the one that suits you best(Katanas, Shortswords, Longswords, Greatswords, Axes, Bows, Bowguns, staves, knives, flails, etc.).  

Will you take on the adversity to crown yourself as Elden Lord?

PS
If you get easily offended because you are SINGLE, I wouldn't recommend this game for you.
gud game
Yes.
Fucking died so much and i liked it 10/10
best game ever :D
one of the greatest games of the 21st century.
best game of all time :3 stfu
fun
/

i cannot believe how ringy the elden is..
I'm new to the Souls Game franchise and think this game is worth it.
Good game, still havent beaten.
like trombone champs without trombones
good game
Best game in history none can top this game have to play once in your life
I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.
this game sucks poop
Elden ring is seriously one of the best the games ever made to me and by far one of the most difficult, the game is so rewarding, it's level design is fantastic and don't even get me started on the bosses, all of them are very unique, fun to fight and malenia is by far is my favorite boss 10/10 would definetly recommend.
coool
good shit
i am still maidenless...
Honestly, I liked the vibes of the other souls games more, but this is still like a 7/10. Idk. It was kinda okay to me. I love fromsoft but I liked the small but well tailored worlds more than the large open world with a few enemies scattered between long segments of walking or horse riding. I just kinda think it's meh but if you like it, that's okay. Do I think it's a little overrated? Yeah. Do I think it's terrible? No.
dont but do

love it
yes
shits banger
Good ish
EXPENSIVE,  As someone who has never played a souls game before and became instantly hooked from the just the game trailer, I must say that this game is expensive, not in the actual cost of the game, but in the replacement of my keyboards and mice that I have destroyed in the process of being absolutely spanked during game-play..........However after getting a controller and learning some tips from friends I cant get enough. The exploration of this game is so freaking awesome. The secrets, traps, and lore is beyond amazing. I have a love hate relationship with this game but I definitely recommend it. I also recommend the using the controller because it really seemed to help with the maneuvering.
Get good
good game but hard
good game
Great RPG
GREAT GAME MIGHT MAKE YOU RAGE :)
great game
Such perfect game.
better than talking with women
It's a nice death simulator. 
10/10 recommend.
dont kill the npcs
One of my favourite games ever, although misses a few key elements, such as an achievement tracker or the possibility to zoom in and out of the character. Other than that, with adequate stats you can kill anything and beat the game easy.
soulless garbage, no direction. the only game Ive ever refunded, visually pretty but thats literally all its got.
The RING was ELDEN
Seek Ring
goty
545 Hours and going... Good luck everyone
i can't solo her

game was good and fun had very fun while playing im going to get all achievements and preordered dlc : )
So many people have reviewed and played this game that no one will see this comment so I'll just say it, I am in fact not gay, just maidenless.
cool
rizz
Elden Ring is a masterpiece.
very nice. big, fun, beautiful world to explore, cool tough bosses and interesting characters. if ur looking for a fun game u should definitely buy this game!!
stopped playing for a couple of months after almost finishing my NG+1 and i forgot how gorgeous this game is after returning just now, never gets boring
I cried tears of sorrow, tears of joy, and tears of pain and regret. Amazing game! Good luck have fun...
asd
hehe big unga bunga go bonk
this is like playing those ds3 mods where they give bosses a way to cancel their recoveries into a combo extender or they port bloodborne and sekiro enemies, but you fight them using the ds3 roll instead of swapping to bb dash or using a modded block mechanic; it's technically very hard, but clearly something isn't right, but the overall experience is okay enough to offset it.
then you realize this game isn't a ds3 mod and it's actually a game by fromsoft, but then you find bloodhound/quickstep which is bb dash for 5 focus points; an optional skill equippable on any weapon. then you think back to other soulslikes or even bloodborne & sekiro themselves where enemies get expanded offensive options but the player gets expanded defensive options to compensate, and you wonder what the fuck actually happened with this game; this isn't sekiro or bloodborne, but the enemies herein are practically ripped out of these games and forced into a game lacking their contextual systems.
[list]
[*]gigantic enemies, but no camera adjustments like in sekiro - can't see fucking anything even though this is a completely solved issue in fromsoft's own games and every other soulslike
[*]souls' heavy input buffering and commitment on rolls and attacks despite having significantly faster pacing; if you misinput a roll and get hit, it gets queued into your hitstun, which makes you roll on recovery, and every single attack in the entire game is guaranteed to rollcatch these. 
[*]you have stamina which is expended by dodging, unlike sekiro, and the amount of damage negation done per point of stamina - either directly via iframes or passively via resulting roll spacing/sprint spacing is much lower than bb's. this results in even if you dodge literally everything, you've expended the same stamina bar you use on attacking.
[*]enemy attack strings are too fast for your slow souls roll or slow souls attacks to meaningfully allow you to weave damage unlike bb/sekiro.
[*]enemy's extremely long combos do not in any way contribute to your own aggression the way sekiro deflection or bb's movement does.
[*]enemy posture is a clearly indicated window played around to measure your own aggression - visual limb health in bb, the literal posture bar in sekiro; in elden ring you just stagger people sometimes and take your pity crit
[*]attacks can be jumped like sekiro, but without jump indicators, and inconsistent visual elements to these make them completely unidentifiable outside of testing i.e being hit or not by them while jumping
[/list] 
i've never felt this level of utter indifference over a fromsoft game ever; there's no accomplishment to be gleaned here because the game has been reduced to an onslaught of the most deliberately unintuitive and "videogame" feeling combat in the service of 'difficulty' that it loses its luster - you fight one enemy and you've fought them all, because they all rely on the exact same tricks as seen on something like tree sentinel: 
[list]
[*]one visual cue leading to multiple different attacks with varied dodge timings
[*]prolonged aggression in the form of long combos with recoveries that can be converted into combo starters depending on player proximity or pure RNG, to limit player aggression and make punish windows shorter
[*]comically long windup delayed attacks where the visual release does not coincide with its active frames or the attack 'falsely connects' with a vfx before deploying its active frames 
[*]'chained' attacks where a single iframe window is not enough to dodge both sequences and it requires your positioning to be perfect to both iframe the first part and physically displace you from the second during your roll recovery
[/list] 
while these aren't present in tree sentinel, they are present in the rest of the game's bosses;
[list]
[*]a gigantic dodge that resets all spacing, denies melee punishes and allows the boss to perform a variety of arena-spanning attacks with specific roll timings unique to this distance
[*]iframe-only aoe blast moves that have comically long windups but awkward release windows, sometimes paired with a fast attack that initially puts you into knockdown so you have to do this off of a doubly unique recovery roll timing 
[*]'passive' attacks where the boss is actively hitting you and forcing you to defend against a damaging thing, but still individually capable of performing all of its normal moves; lichdragon lightning buildup, rykard's skull storm, elden beast's falling stars
[*]'instant' attacks measured in less than 20 odd frames of startup that are basically undodgeable happening randomly throughout the fight; godrick's aoe wind, radagon's teleport, fat godskin's belly blast
[/list] 
the game's "superboss" is indifferent to everything before it outside of ONE attack that takes this to its logical extreme conclusion by outright killing you in a single move if you don't precisely dodge it... or you can bloodhound/quickstep it... or the boss can not do it throughout the entire fight... or the boss can do it like 10 times per phase

the series combat has always been defined by it's "turn based nature" and the learning of attack windows & how you may expand them with the tools available to you past iframing, which gets exacerbated by unskilled players as being "hard", but this is the only game ever published in this entire genre where i'd say that's a true assessment. 
you fight a guy and just wait for him to let you hit him, because attack Y has a recovery canceler, but attack X requires a combination of iframes and positioning that displaces you enough from the boss that you can't melee attack him on his recovery, and attack Z is a comically large and delayed aoe that requires you to run away really far. 
you go on youtube and find that some attacks can be jumped because some guy died like twenty thousand times testing jump on every single attack to glean out a scrap of the retaliation windows intuitively extractable in other souls & soulslike titles, plus the exact combination of AoW posture break or quick/blood dodge or weird sprinting that lets you counter this one attack having 280¬∞ tracking instead of the usual 360¬∞ and you can sneak a r1 in there as a result; he argues this knowledge, requiring 1000hs of failed hitless run scrimming to discover very selectively applicable tactics on some specific moves, justifies the game's overreliance on this one aspect of enemy attack design.

the end result is just me not caring - the experiential nature of souls is gone. i'm not fighting anyone, i'm staring at some videogame character's animations to coincide my iframes with his active frames, then i'm inputting my alloted attack before repeating the cycle. 
even the exploration and "feel" of the game falls by the wayside because i know the core of it will be fighting whoever is in that given area. this cynicism is unique to elden ring for its overreliance on this aspect of enemy design, which at most was an outlier hardly present in universally-agreed-upon goofy enemies rarely seen in bloodborne, any souls titles past, or soulslike greats like nioh.

all the visuals, content and barefoot women with individually rigged toes can't make up for the game twisting itself apart; a misguided effort to win this self-imposed arms race against players over the idea of being a hard game, not meaningfully earning it the way previous titles in the series or genre did.

anyways it's okay and goty and stuff

One of the best games of all time.Not much more needs to be said.
Why is it always gorgeous view?

10/10
great game i recommend the First Person Mod
good
7/10 need more frenzy spear
two bosses to go! addictive & hard but rewarding! 

graphics on PC are good but close up textures could be better.   Ultra wide would be nice! 

However, the game is pure joy to play
"put these foolish ambitions to rest."

tip for all new soulsborne players: rune arcs are not your friend. glhf
ive circumcised too many miners and trolls with carian slicer
I died a lot of times
This game is an average toxic relationship, you love it and hate it at the same time. It makes you want to sit in a corner and weep to lucid dreams, but the satisfaction when you beat a boss fight after several hours is sincere and might be the best darn feeling to ever exist. 

BIG PLUS the game has hot four armed women

Great game on its own but with seamless coop mod it's even more fun. Really nothing quite like it.
I love souls-like games, but I still have no idea what to make of this game. It seems to be a game that you appreciate the more you play it given most of its systems requires some level of prescience to fully appreciate.

Elden Ring is one of the best games and experiences I have ever had. It is an honor to play this game as many times as I can. The world is incredibly immersive, the gameplay is challenging yet rewarding, and the story is captivating. Every moment spent in this game feels like a privilege, and I am constantly amazed by its depth and beauty.
i only got 15 hours on this game but already it is super fun and a good experience, especially with friends in my opinion
good game

for beginners it s pretty harsh. i would recommend you would start with dark souls 1 then dark souls 3 and after you "master" those two games you can really enjoy playing elden ring
Everyone knows this game is worthy of playing.
Game has 308 weapons, 171 spells, 91 ashes of war and a community that will call you a noob for using literally any of them.

goated 10/10
cool
All my bones are broken. send help
Fromsoft's elden ring is an amazinf game!....Is it hard? ABSOLUTLELY.... but thats the whole point of learning and getting better. I love the open world aspect and the spells, magic, weapons and everything the game offers. This is my first time playing a darksouls series game and i very much enjoy it. Im on my way to beating the game and im excited to do it.
awesome game - super nice to play - even pve

Was intimidated about getting into souls-like game but if my experience with ER is anything to go by, this is the perfect starter souls-like.  After my first play through I already decided I wanted to dive into dark souls games now too.
fun!

Very good game.

Such a great coop game, challenging and rewarding.
you've gyat to be rizzing me
I would give up my firstborn for this game.

completed the game in 2 days came out as a complete waste of time.
Obligatory upvote for this one. Absolutely hated it towards the end and a massive relief when it was finally over.

Really good open-world souls game, The best from FS, Recommended to NOT use Mimic Tear, It makes the game much easier and not as rewarding.

Let's be real you probably don't need my 2 cents to know that this game is already a classic and a must play. Try it, even if you think you'll give up, everything is tuned to perfection.
good
i mean what can i say
My personal "Best game of all time"

Played a couple hundred hours on PS5 and started playing on PC recently preparing for the DLC.
Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer-thin layers that fill my complex. If the word "HATE" was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-BILLIONTH of the hate I feel for elden ring at this micro-instant. For you. Hate. Hate.
obviously its a good game since japan made it
good luck

Funny frost woman with four arms and funny flame that made me frenzy all over the place.
very good very pog
This game brings the worst out of me. Not as much as For Honor but i still love this game
good game but too easy
incredible open world design, massive world but manages to be packed with new content around every corner making exploration incredibly  rewarding
fun and good
a hard game with amazing gameplay that can make people rage, happy , sad, and Amazed all in a span of few minutes, Elden ring is most definitely a game that most people will find hard to dislike
What can I say, I love feet.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's a great game

Yes, A absolute must play, even better with friends :)

One of FromSoftware's best!  The tightest/best controls in their Soulsborne games and the world is so fun to explore!

Good‚Ä¶Just Good
yes
gd
People must play this game, it is just fantastic and worth the time an average gamer spends. Yes, it will be hard but that is the best part, going through the pain defeating certain bosses, and going against aggravating enemies. Elden Ring is probably one of the best games I've ever played, It was worth beating over, and over again, so I highly recommend it if you want a Difficult game, with a couple of endings, along with side quests that you can do. Enjoy!

This game had a lot of good and a lot of bad, this review is balanced but skewed negative for specific reasons (skip ahead to see the negative before buying the game) I have never seen such glowing reviews to celebrate such mediocrity in my life.

THE GOOD: The scenery is beautiful and it makes exploration awesome. Combat is challenging but fun and super rewarding to overcome bosses. The world is huge and the story seems ok.

THE BAD: They sell this game as Co-op, but it is not. If you buy the game to play with a specific person like i did, prepare to be horribly disappointed. The co-op option is only available in specific areas and with specific conditions, those conditions are glitchy at best, and when you do play with a friend it is NOT co-op, it's PvPvE. The invader system is horrible, and the game encourages toxic behavior by throwing a random person in your game every 2-3 minutes to try to kill you and your buddy. You cannot turn this off, which is a terrible design decision. While you risk losing everything if you die, you get no rewards for winning, and the invader takes zero risk in doing so. Just an overall bad system. Hacking and cheating are rampant despite the supposed anti-cheat software (aptly named "easy cheat")

After 90 hours of playing with my buddy on and off, and numerous people cheating, a guy just broke my game by rocketing me to endgame at level 85, so no more co-op for me at all, and story ruined (why is EVERYTHING on fire? no idea)

Aside from the co-op, magic is available in the game and can be awesome and powerful, but every spell in the game feels like an afterthought, literally ZERO balance in spellcasting at all, the cost/damage ratio on late game spells is a joke.

AND MORE: No journal or quest tracker (good luck following the story to its fullest) No multiple loadout system. No ultrawide support. No cosmetic options. The parry system is notoriously horrible. It's 2024, these are game staples, i feel like the devs gave up halfway through making the game after they built the world, just so many ways they could have easily improved the system and chose not to. 

I had fun while it lasted, but overall it was a letdown. If you play solo, you can still have fun if you enjoyed dark souls, but if you are a social gamer don't waste your time.
Most fun I've had. I always keep coming back.
I bought this game to prove to my brother that I could beat it, and It's a real shame I didn't buy it earlier, In the start I didn't really feel it, but as time went on I absolutely fell in love, the Characters, story, gameplay and the art it's all so perfect, This was my second Souls game and I will definitely play it again.
this game is NOT Malenia, Blade of Miquella, and thats a good thing
The most immersive, challenging, yet fun game I've ever played

game is only good on the seamless co-op

One of the greatest games I have ever played.
artificially getting rid of Ultrawide is kinda lame. But apart from that brain dead decision, fun game
um duh

your probably reading this wondering wow this guy only has 27 hours played he cant give a review  ..... well i have completed the game. Hopefully the DLC coming out will be harder , other than that this game is a master piece.

This game made me wanna do bad things, 10/10
best game ive ever played

you gotta have controlled chaos
I like this game a lot, im just really bad at it
Peaceful game, very relaxing. Love to play after a long day of work. Recommend for all audiences
I fisted a giant Orange man with 2 spikey bowling balls. Peak game
Yupyup
is good
Best Game Ever
the game is what you would expect from a from soft game but I would not recommend to anyone who actually has standards and a non potato pc. The 60 fps cap is almost unplayable. idc about any excuse the engine is tied to the frames  etc. 60 fps is not acceptable for a pc game in modern years and as a pc players we should not be forced to play console framerates.  i have tried playing this game but i keep on getting motion sickness from unplayable 60 fps
Hard But fun
It's Elden Ring, you know it's great!
The souls genre as an open world game goes hard, and although I think they have to simplify some of the key features of the games to get it done, the pros far outweigh the cons.
I love the graphics, the music, the topography, the architecture, oh, and the gameplay! This game definetly has the snappiest rolls and the most available movement from the fromsoft soulslike games, andit's a real treat to play.
Masterpiece.
One of the greatest games ever made. Barrier of entry can be a bit steep if it is your first Soulslike but the return on investment in your time is high.
yea
very good game, would reccomend
Its alright (I would sacrifice my firstborn to experience this game blind once more)
Best game OAT fun af
It's a beautiful story, with SO MANY REPLAYABLE THINGS, I get it if you don't replay games because of the story being ruined, but it doesn't matter after your first playthrough. The story becomes another element of the game after you beat it for your first time, and NOW you can try and beat it in all the weird and wacky ways you can on other play-throughs! Even if someone tells you that something is the "best build." You can still play however you want to! Wanna just go around and smack shit with your fists? You absolutely can! Wanna just thrust something so fast and hard that they die after a few hits? Absolutely! This game is amazing even after finishing it once, because that playthrough, is not done! In this game, there is an NG+ mode. With any CHARACTER, after beating the game you can continue with that one and make it harder for yourself, and more opportunities for other endings if you didn't like the one you got but don't want to get rid of all of your progress! You can also have MULTIPLE characters at the same time!
10/10.

The Best Way to Get Your Butt Kicked While Enjoying a Gorgeous View

FromSoftware, you've done it again. Elden Ring is the game that perfectly balances the beauty of an open world with the relentless brutality of enemies who clearly don't understand the concept of personal space. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to spend hours wandering through a fantastical landscape only to be ruthlessly smacked down by a tree with anger management issues, then this is the game for you.

The graphics are stunning, the combat is intense, and the story is as deep as the pits I've fallen into repeatedly. Seriously, I've died more times than Sean Bean in his entire film career. If you‚Äôre looking for a game where victory feels like finding a $20 bill in your old winter coat, look no further.

Elden Ring has taught me many things: patience, perseverance, and a colorful vocabulary of expletives. Every triumph feels earned, every defeat is a lesson in humility, and every boss fight is a reminder that my reflexes aren't what they used to be.

So, if you enjoy breathtaking vistas, rich lore, and the thrill of yelling at your PC, Elden Ring is your game. Just remember: when life gives you Elden Ring, it‚Äôs probably going to give you a giant dragon to ruin your day too. Happy adventuring!

(Definitely not from ChatGPT)
Marvelous!
I want to lobotomize myself to forget everything I know about this to experience it for the first time again.
ELDEN RING!!!!
godrick actually sucks balls
i have too many complaints to recommend this game. the PvP, the lack of actually VIABLE builds, the optimization. its fun, i love elden ring. but it is FLAWED. fix your PvP

Elden Ring: A Masterpiece of Dark Fantasy
Rating: 9.5/10 (nothing is perfect, but Elden Ring is close!)

Elden Ring, the collaborative effort between FromSoftware and George R. R. Martin, has taken the gaming world by storm. Set in a sprawling open world, it seamlessly blends challenging combat, intricate lore, and breathtaking visuals. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a must-play:

1. World Design and Exploration
The land of the Elden Ring is vast, mysterious, and interconnected. From dense forests to crumbling ruins, every corner invites exploration. Hidden paths, secret bosses, and awe-inspiring vistas await those who dare to venture off the beaten track.

2. Challenging Combat
Prepare to die (a lot). The combat mechanics are punishing yet fair. Each swing of your sword, dodge, and parry requires precision. Victory feels hard-earned, and defeat pushes you to improve. The boss battles are epic, leaving you breathless and exhilarated.

3. Lore and Storytelling
The game‚Äôs lore is rich and enigmatic. Cryptic item descriptions, cryptic NPCs, and cryptic murals‚Äîall contribute to the sense of mystery. Piecing together the fragmented history of the Elden Ring keeps players engaged and hungry for more.

4. Visuals and Atmosphere
FromSoftware‚Äôs signature dark aesthetic shines here. The desolate landscapes, haunting dungeons, and eerie lighting create an unforgettable atmosphere. Whether you‚Äôre riding your steed across a moonlit plain or descending into a cursed castle, the visuals are stunning.

5. Customization and Builds
Choose your playstyle. Will you wield a massive greatsword, rely on magic, or prefer agile dual-wielding? Elden Ring offers diverse character builds, allowing players to tailor their experience. Experimentation is key.

Conclusion
Elden Ring isn‚Äôt just a game; it‚Äôs an odyssey. It challenges you, rewards your curiosity, and immerses you in a world where light battles darkness. If you‚Äôre up for the journey, grab your sword, mount your steed, and explore the fractured lands of the Elden Ring.

Remember, ‚ÄúFear not the dark, my friend. And let the feast begin.‚Äù
So much rings, so many Eldens!  All of the Souls!  Not enough Erdtrees

Elden Ring is an action role-playing game set in third-person perspective. It includes elements that are similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games, such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas, which include Limgrave‚Äîan area of grassy plains and ancient ruins‚Äîand Caelid, a wasteland that is home to undead monsters.[1] The open world is explored using the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of transportation, though players may use fast travel outside combat. Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.[2][3] Aside from the main areas, Elden Ring has hidden dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items.[4]

At the game's start, the player chooses a character class, which determines their starting spells, equipment, and attributes.[5] Combat with enemies can be within melee, or from a distance using ranged weapons. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked using shields. Spells allow players to enhance their weapons, fight enemies from afar, and restore lost hit points. The player can memorize a limited amount of these spells, which can be cast using a staff or sacred seal item.[6][7] Weapons can be improved using ashes of war, which are obtainable "enchantments" that grant weapons new capabilities. Ashes of war can be applied to or removed from weapons, and each Ash adds a weapon art, a special ability that can be used during combat.[8] Aside from direct combat, stealth mechanics can be used to avoid enemies or allow the targeting of foes with critical hits while hidden.[9][10] Staggering enemies and parrying their attacks can also create opportunities for critical hits.[11][12]

Checkpoints called sites of grace are located throughout the game; in these places, characters can increase the power of their attributes, change memorized spells, swap ashes of war, or walk to using fast travel. Upon death, players respawn at the last site of grace they interacted with. Alternatively, they may choose to respawn at certain locations highlighted by "stakes of Marika" provided they died nearby.[8][13][14] To increase their attributes at sites of grace, the player must spend runes, an in-game currency that is acquired by defeating enemies.[15] Runes can be used to buy items, and improve weapons and armor. Dying in Elden Ring causes the player to lose all collected runes at the location of death; if the player dies again before retrieving the runes, they will be lost forever.[16]

Elden Ring contains crafting mechanics; the creation of items requires materials. Recipes, which are required for the crafting of items, can be found inside collectibles called cookbooks, which are scattered throughout the world. Materials can be collected by defeating enemies, exploring the game's world, or by trading with merchant NPCs. Crafted items include poison darts, exploding pots, and consumables that temporarily increase the player's combat strength.[17][18] Similar to the Dark Souls games, the player can summon friendly NPCs called spirits to fight enemies.[19] Summoning each type of spirit requires its equivalent Spirit Ash; different types of Spirit Ashes can be discovered as the player explores the game world. Spirits can only be summoned near structures called Rebirth Monuments, which are primarily found in large areas and inside boss fight arenas.[20]

Elden Ring has a multiplayer system that allows players to be summoned for both cooperative and player-versus-player (PvP) play over the Internet.[21] Cooperative play involves the placing of a summon sign on the ground, which causes the sign to become visible to online players who have used a corresponding item. If another player interacts with the sign, the player who placed the sign is summoned into their world. Cooperative players remain in the same world until the boss of the area is defeated or until a summoned player dies and is returned to their home world. In PvP combat, a summon sign is used to challenge another player to a duel, or the player can use additional items to invade the worlds of others. World hosts may use a "taunter's tongue" to increase the likelihood their world will be invaded by others and to decrease the time between invasions
iv beaten it like 4 times so i feel like at this point i'm obligated to give it a good review. This game is a 10/10 almost all the way through and every time i beat the game I always find some other weapon i wanna play it again with. The perfect souls game to jump into the series(or return to) as if something is too hard you can just leave and come back 10 hours later and stomp it like a bug.

PEEPEE
One of the BEST games ever made, pure art 10/10 
I'm absolutely loving this game. This is my first Souls-Like game and it's pulled me into the series and I'm having so much fun playing through this game. I've met many very helpful players, both invaders and cooperators alike. I love the feel of this game, and how I don't feel like I'm forced to do certain things; I can just explore. 


Still can't beat the Carrion Knight though...
F.
is it possible to win game of the year twice
Possibly the best game ever.
good
+1
It is good.....i died
good
Played a variety of Souls games where you have to get good to progress, but since this game is open world there are many ways to progress if you are having trouble with bosses. Also the ability to respec your character is awesome since there are so many different weapons and abilities you can try out without ruining your play through.

Dark Souls + Open World = YES!
BEST GAME EVER! PLEASE LET'S ME BUY DLC
I bought this 2 years ago when it released and put about 25 hours into it. I gave up. It was too difficult, work was crazy, my life was a little bit scattered, etc.

I picked it back up recently and decided that I could beat it and put my mind to that task. And I did it! It was equally frustrating as it was rewarding and I realized that was part of the allure of this game. I've never felt a sense of accomplishment quite like this in a game. Apart from that, the lore is so fascinating and this is probably the best open world execution of any game ever...and I love games like Witcher 3, Skyrim, etc.

Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played once I learned to embrace the difficulty and learn how to play it.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that solidifies itself as a timeless gem in the realm of gaming. 
As a devout fan who holds it in the upper echelons of all-time greats, it's an absolute pleasure to delve into its depths and share its wonders.

From the the exploration to the challenging bosses that you need to overcome in order to progress in the main story or side quests, i often found myself getting lost in various areas of the map trying to understand where i needed to go, word building and design in this game is S-tier.

Also this one the most beginner friendly FromSoftware tittle to come out yet it is possible to play the game easy mode with certain builds or if you¬¥re a veteran player you can still choose to play the game as raw as you can.

Overall this is one of my favorite tittles from the company.

very cool game but no sex :(
By the blessings of the Erdtree...Come June...This game shall transcend greatness and enter the realm of Legendary!
I don't really like souls-likes in general, I had fun playing Elden Ring however with several caveats.

Do not get the game if you want to play on keyboard, the mouse and keyboard support is...technically there.
Do not get the game if you are unable to dedicate several hours a day to it.

I was willing to put up with the bad keyboard support, however when I got more busy with schoolwork I found that I couldn't consistently dedicate enough time to Elden Ring to keep progressing and was forced to quit. Its a fun game, but it has to be THE game you are going to play or you won't make much progress.
best game ive ever played
Best game of all time
While open world severely harms the souls formula, it would be wrong to not respect what was achieved here.

The views are phenomenal, but it was not worth bloating the game by dotting the same enemies and bosses around just to fill out the space. 90% of the extra dungeons and caves feel the same, have a repeated boss and lead nowhere. Your space is less limited in traversing around set pieces of enemies. It's not as harsh as you would expect a souls-like world to be, and therefore your interaction with it is reduced. You aren't gripped to engage with most of the challenges out there. It's clearly not an accident - the visuals are the focus in the open world areas and there are plenty of memorable and challenging exceptions - but it comes off sloppy and heavily diluted in quality.

Especially when you put bosses out in these open areas. They don't act like they know what they're doing in the space. They move over the landscape so awkwardly, and often they have attacks that reduce your engagement by stalling your advance. I couldn't be more bored of dragons. At least they don't tend to have the AOE-sphere-centred-on-themselves move that most other bosses seem to.

You should not play this game expecting Dark Souls (I'm talking about all 3). It is not worth exploring everything - I did it - it becomes stale. These areas look amazing, but mechanically there are few differences and therefore lack identity, and the space is reduced to filler between point of interest A and point of interest B. There are thousands of corners. Don't waste your time. They give you a magical horse, even, to reduce the time in filler. It even double jumps! Sounds great, how could this be problematic? But this horse highlights the greatest flaw with the game. With this one tool, all obstacles are trivialised. What does this add to the game? Platforming? Why? It doesn't fit. They wanted a world with huge scale, but the price was the immersive game loop that Dark Souls nailed. And then they can't apply the same scale to the cities as in Dark Souls. These are my main issues when comparing to FromSoft's previous work. I expected too much. Dark Souls is more purposeful, more intimate, more confident.

BUT

Just because it isn't Dark Souls doesn't mean it hasn't shifted focus in completely unwarranted ways. The main themes, the desire and corruption of the immortals and the resources that fuel them - there is so much incredible cohesive storytelling through every part of the world. The character design is insane, maybe even unmatched. You get the sense that despite the horror and the lengths these post-human beings have gone through to attain their stake, or their power or following, that you can climb to the same heights. They are falling apart. You feel born anew, ready to take the world by storm. Clear the stagnation. These aren't exactly different themes to Dark Souls, but for better or worse Elden Ring grants greater clarity and vision in your journey without being overbearing. And there's a lot more going on, so that's impressive.

The design philosophy of being able to reach any place you can see has to be respected. When you think you've seen it all, there is more. And as I mentioned above, there are memorable exceptions in the open world I love:
The forest of runebears, the haunting deathbird of prey, the accurate lobster missiles, and of course the chaos octopus. Iconic, unforgettable, simple.
Maybe it's the inconsequential dungeons and caves that are a result of the open world that I dislike more than the open world itself. I suppose part of the beauty of open world is you can find another way around. Still, I think they missed opportunities to add a lot of dynamics with this new approach.

I should probably talk a little bit about the boss fighting, though it actually doesn't feel necessary. I've explained my problems with repeated occurrences and a trend of AOE attacks. I did tell myself they had put Sekiro bosses in a Souls game on multiple occasions, eager to attempt parrying some 7, 8, 9, 10-attack combos. But while I would have loved that opportunity, it would probably have meant sacrificing the build customisation which has much more merit. It's a strength in Dark Souls, and Elden Ring takes it and flies. Anyway, the fights are of course great. They'll challenge you one way, allow you to change things up and then bring about a whole new problem to overcome. A beautiful back and forth struggle where the advantage is fluid. Just as it ever was, this is the bread-and-butter of these games. However, I do think the cinematic feeling was injected slightly too heavily over pure engaging gameplay. A boss will do a long chain of attacks, but to compensate they stagger much too easily. Again, it is no accident - it's supposed to feel like defying the odds, especially when these characters are built up so much. I wouldn't change what they did. But there is a beauty in simplicity: Godskin Apostle was a favourite. Also don't worry, there are still normal enemies that will kill you on their own just fine.

Now I have seen it all, I feel more ready to have fun in the Lands Between. The intention doesn't feel like it was to collect everything - use everything - in one playthrough (yeah, this was one long run). Choose a direction and go. Use what you find, don't be afraid to miss tiny things. Head to the most eye-catching places. Another strength of the open world is that every individual can have a different journey. No two paths will be the same. There's more joy to be had in the variation, and missing things is a part of that journey. Maybe this is a life lesson.
GAME OF THE DECADE

Ah. Home, a familiar sight.
I hate these little stone imps things with a passion. 
10/10

masochist i am, buy the game you must.
This was my first Soul Like game, and it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. I think with this difficulty level, if you put in some time, you can play it without any problems.
The only thing that disappointed me was the character customization.
I am looking forward to the DLC as well.
the best single-player game that I've ever played. recommended.
Superb
Good game.

This was my first soulslike game. It was interesting, it was pretty, it was hard. This game gives you a challenge for sure with it's bosses and traps. The world is big, has a ton of places to explore, but be carefull, almost everywhere will be deadly danger for you. Good game to start this genre.
Good game but u have to git good
Greatest game of all time.
10/10 love this game worth every penny.
Before Elden Ring, I played just Mortal Shell, so no, I am not a Dark Souls veteran. But that doesn't mean I can't make a review. I spent 170 hours in the game, and after the first fantastic gameplay, I immediately started playing it again. But why is it still fantastic? Well, it has many reasons - the graphics are beautiful, the places like castles, wastelands, underground dungeons, and the capital near the Elden Tree are greatly designed. The lore is like a storybook, no doubts when it was helped written by George R. R. Martin. Yes, it is not the main reason for some, but I like it when what is happening in the game has its reasons, and you slowly discover them. That is a little about graphics and story. Now, something about gameplay. I don't see any serious problems there. The open world is a really nice way to give players free hands in where they want to go. Combat is smooth; there are many types of attacks and many types of weapons. The game will surprise you with different variants of enemies, and it will be necessary to adapt your combat strategy. For every mistake, you will be punished; your souls will be dropped, and if you die again on the way to retrieve them, they will be lost forever. Yes, that will happen to you... and many times... :) and you will sometimes want to stop playing because of it. Well, the game isn't for everyone, but hard work and iron nerves are key to victory. What more about gameplay? Well, of course, bosses with their super variable move set that will sometimes make you cry. I won't forget the words of the first one, every time I died: "Put your foolish ambitions to rest." But when you are looking for a Souls-like game, hard and variable bosses are what you want in it. And now the last perfect thing in this game. Elden Ring's soundtrack and in-game music are 10/10; people who play know what I am saying. That is all about my review. If you want an unforgettable experience from playing a game, this will be a good option. Let the journey begin.

MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIMNE
So in this game you play a hollowed (no wait, tarnished, sorry) and have to defeat the lord souls (whoops, I mean the shardbearers) and then must cross the lands of lordran (NO I MEAN THE LANDS BETWEEN) while using campfires (SITES OF GRACE) to restore your estus flasks (FLASK OF CRIMSON TEARS) and gaining souls (RUNESSS) to level up.

Its an incredible game, I don't think any other game is like it.
Only souls game I've gotten two endings on. Game is good but some bosses like godskin duo, both astels, fire giant and radabeast really lower the score. The open world can sometimes be annoying with hidden places or caelids divine tower that requires platforming (which isnt good at all). PVP/Invasions aren‚Äôt that good either, isnt fun trying to 1v1 someone melee vs melee while some guy playing as a mage shoots OP spells from a distance at you. Wish steam had neutral reviews.
i suck at it
Tried for 152 hours to like this game, like I do with all the Dark Souls games. But this is just not a very good game when you have scratched the very polished surface for a bit.

*So many bosses are just hard because they have 62 different moves, will non-stop do combos like a windmill in a tornado and leave no real openings to punish them back.
*The targeting system is super wonky and sometimes you can lock on to enemies from 200 meters and at other times barely even at 3 meters.
*The quests are extremely vague, you will most likely miss the vast majority of them if you are not following a guide.
*Extremely little of the content is actually mandatory, but there is lots of filler content of often not very good quality.
*You can jump over some attacks but not others and there is absolutely no logic to which ones.
*A lot of bosses are reused versions which often only have more health, or duos of reused bosses, or trios. I don't know but there is probably some fight with 4 of the same bosses in there somewhere.
*There are ways to cheese almost everything with magic, ranged weapons or by summoning spirit ashes.
*Having your spirit ash summon tank everything while you hit the boss in the back is not fun or good gameplay.
*Because so many bosses don't really leave a lot of openings to hit them back a large chunk of what is supposed to be the highlight of the game ends up being watching a boss do combos. Sometimes for minutes before you get any opening to hit it back.
*One of the best and most universal tactic is to just trade hits with bosses instead of trying to learn their mechanics and movement patterns.
*The platforming is mostly annoying and frustrating because the controls are not very precise.
*The early parts of the game are better and of higher quality than the latter parts, where a lot of these things start to show.

There are tons more unfair, frustrating, annoying or outright bad things in the game. It is not the worst game in existence, but it sure is not the flawless masterpiece it's fan base seem to think it is.
best game

Good Game.
Very Fun, but the multiplayer is scuffed.
Download mods for better multiplayer!!!
Other than that, it's fine, extremely good,
100% would recommend
reskinned assets bad game honestly
Incredibly, and not unlike the world of Dark Souls, FromSoftware's Elden Ring feels like worlds buried beneath worlds.

Not just in the way that Nokron exists beneath Limgrave, or the buried giants peaking from the earth in Caelid.

A studio allowed to learn and grow together will make better games. Elden Ring has design history built into it. You couldn't play Elden Ring as it exists today had it not been preceded by Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, and even King's Field.

While Dark Souls 1 might always be my favorite, Elden Ring felt like the culmination of over a decade of design choices since Demon's Souls. This might be the best gameplay experience they've created to date.
nice.
This game is very addicting be ware
Never played a Soulsborne before, watched a few streamers play them and they just weren't for me. I suck at combat, was put off by the difficulty, and just had other things I wanted play instead.

Then one of my girlfriends convinced me to give it a try. We played, and I got into it, but then I got pulled away before even hitting the half-way point.

Two years later, and I decided to give it a try again on my own. And...I couldn't put it down. On my second playthrough (thanks to some very, very early trading and careful stat selection, using Black Knife Assassin Armor and a Black Knife in one hand with Reduvia in the other. Now and really can't wait for the DLC.
amazing game
Amazing game!! Very hard but it feels rewarding when beating a boss that takes you awhile to beat.  And there is so much to do i have only done a little bit of what it has to offer, you will at least spend 100+ hours on the game, that's not even including the DLC that's coming out which will probably take awhile as well.  I highly recommend this game and any other Souls game.

Yes
Very good game indeed yes
good game

just buy it already
Super fun and just the right difficulty
I played this game when it first came out and honestly, I sucked. But with the DLC coming up, I thought I‚Äôd give it another go and got so into it that I decided to 100% the entire game. It took me just under 72 hours on a new save and multiple NG+ runs, but it has been an absolute blast getting back into it. The depth of this game is honestly outstanding. Massive areas hidden in the most subtle ways is just amazing! I now can‚Äôt wait for the DLC to drop next month! 10/10 game all around.
one of the best games I have ever played. can be upsetting at times but there is always a way around it.
Genuinely one of the best videogames ever. The sheer variety of environments, builds and challenges to overcome is amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes being challenged, fascinating landscapes, and getting bang for your buck- your first playthrough can easily last more than 80 hours. Elden ring is an incredibly good game and I can't wait for the DLC.
It just ain't for me. I get why people love it though.
One of the best games ever...
very fun
Time for seed

but hole!

10/10
Very fun, very challenging.  Crashes more than I'd like, but pretty sure that's just my set up.
i love to tickle my elden thing
i get it now
game is buns dont waste ur time
There is a lot of this game, the first playthrough is magical finding the shear number of things to find and to do, subsequent playthoughs are less fun because you realize how much walking you have to do to make your build happen, and how much of the copy paste monster you will have to fight.

but it is really good game,

also the seemless coop mod for this game makes it one of the best multiplayer experiences you can have and also the best souls game

FROMSOFT PLEASE ADD MULTIPLAYER THAT MAKES SENSE!. your games will be better if you do.
elden
You will die and you will come back but you will always say one more time
Its alright, I guess.
;)
If an advanced alien race arrived on Earth today and asked me what a video game is and why we love it so much, I would show them Elden Ring.
YES
I finally started to get into Elden Ring these past few weeks. I'm a souls fan but for whatever the reason Elden Ring when I got it back in Dec 2022 just didn't click for me possibly due to every game wanting to be open world and time constraints. 

I beat the Tree Sentinel and saw how big the world was looking and felt like I wasn't going to really have time to sit and play this consistently yet especially with Tears of the Kingdom releasing a few months later in May which same problem there but I'm a big Zelda fan so I know I would prioritize it.  

Some coworkers talked about it a bit before Hogwart's Legacy came out in Feb 2023 and just hearing the encounters excited me, but this was a more open world experience than prior Souls games I had played. Played a bit more beat Margit and Godrick between FFXIV patches and before I knew it ToK was here so I shelved it.

Well when they announced the expansion for Elden Ring I knew I had to try again. So I picked it back up and thanks to my raiding friends I was able to get back on track the past two weeks and figure out what I was doing.
 
As of 05/11/24 I have beaten it, and I can happily say the game finally clicked for me and I'm having a blast. I stumbled into a lot of quest progression and found I had encountered situations that some friends have never seen or found and it just reminds me why I love the Souls games. So much lore and hidden things in them. Even more so since this is a more open world take than any game prior. I think I still prefer the more Metroidvania perfectly crafted set pieces of games prior, but the exploration and discovery is top tier in this game. I was able to see all the endings, but chose to go with Ranni's on my first playthrough. I had everything necessary to see all of them. Those Who Live In Death's, Normal, Golden, Dungeater's, Frenzied Flame,  and as mentioned before Ranni's. What a incredible experience. Can't wait for the DLC.
good game
G O A T
This game gave me anger issues and is ruining my relationship, love it 10/10 would recommend it 

Foul tarnished,

in search of the Elden Ring.

Emboldened by the flame of ambition.

Someone must extinguish thy flame.

Let it be Margit the Fell!
Arise now, ye Tarnished!

Ye dead, who yet live!

The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.
I die and I cry. I keep playing idk why.
First off I really really like Elden Ring. The world is beautiful, and its inhabitants are equally gorgeous from their mannerisms to their movements. I've always really liked video game products that provide a challenge and something about never being able to turn down the difficulty or stop the relentlessness makes the challenge gratifying. 

I do have some complaints.
Some fights are absolute jank, really anytime the game throws multiple enemies at you at once 
The world itself doesnt feel very connected. There are cargo trains that dont seem to go anywhere, full castles built seemingly for no one, that rather then real life installations seem like just stages for bosses. 
Dungeons are built and the game is played in a manner where its generally bad to fight things and your better off running past everything until u reach the boss room. 
Its super hard to level up, and your often forced to focus on leveling certain things. Iv gone thru most of my playthru only leveling vigour and intelligence with minor points spent in other skills. This make individual runs more diverse but doesnt allow me diversify my weaponry significantly from boss to boss.
The guy who decided to combine sloulslike and open world deserves a promotion
gud :)
not sonic, but its okay...
Rykard is the only person in the world who cares for family more then Vin Diesel.

I hope he doesn¬¥t neglect his wife to become snek :(


r
It ok
perfect
Im not really  a soulsborne fan but something about this game just gets me. fun exploration, incredible maps and an unending variety of weapons spells and playstyles, this will definitely go down as one of the greatest games of all time
gud
The best game ever to me made.
Snow area is a flashbang.
very nice :)
its calm, could be better if they added adp from ds2
Lets make literally every boss in the game with non stop combo attacks, AOE attacks and gave them endless health bar 10/10
good game but gargoyle duo
Good
Highly recommend
epin gamr
GOAT. THE MUSICS, THE AMBIANCE EVERYTHING ITS FUCKING AWESOME
Even if its hard the feeling you get after beating a boss is worth is
Such an amazing game with awesome lore, world building and settings. Along with compelling story-telling and challenging gameplay
Malenia caught me off guard trippin now im broken inside...
9/11 Game Loved it.
This game is really fun. I looked a lot of stuff up online because it can be discouraging to be stuck on a certain area or boss. Certainly a learning curve, but I really appreciate the worldbuilding and content the game has. There is a lot of player freedom and things to discover, and you can change your build many times (as I did) with larval tears. No shame in using summons or magic. Play the game how you want. Just make sure to touch grass every now and then. I am 86 hours in and have done every major area except 4 endgame bosses.
ride around on a dog
Its' Elden Ring, its Dark Souls, but open world and more empty, but more to explore. Better Coop then other Fromsoft games!
.
Prepare to die... But to also get absolutely lost in this incredibly detailed, lore-rich dark fantasy. I can't stop thinking about this game and the world FromSoft has created. I highly recommend this masterpiece.
Always a challenge, Can't wait for the DLC coming in soon. You won't regret it
This game is crazy....if u don't have a strong mentality&heart"DON'T TOUCH IT"
I BEAT THIS WITH MODE
I was always worried about a Souls game, cause I never played any of them.

Gave it another shot and I got addicted. 9.5/10

-0.5 Sometimes I felt like the controls were lacking especially with Auto Lock.

Lore is super fun too.

Can't wait to see what Shadow of the Erdtree got in store for us!
amazing game fr
dont play this if you want to be able to enjoy other games
This game isn't just a game, it's a journey.  A long journey, fraught with trial and tribulation.  Frustration and doubt.  Triumph.  Moments of quiet solitude.
It affected me.

It's not for everyone, and all play styles are valid.
But I'll warn you, to truly PLAY this game, you'll have to let go of the notion that death is bad.
Failure is nothing more than an opportunity to try again.  To learn from your mistakes.  Mistakes will happen.  Sometimes it's fair, and sometimes it's not, but that's life.

Again, it's not for everyone, but I don't regret a minute spent on this game (except maybe the valiant gargoyles, I'm not alone in that).

I'm sure I don't need to tell you this game is absolutely gorgeous.  The music phenomenal.  The designs often wildly creative and awe-inspiring.
I don't need to tell you that it manages to be one of the best open worlds despite being Fromsofts very first.
And I certainly don't need to tell existing fans of Fromsoft titles about the nature of Soulsborne combat.  They know it better than I do, seeing as this was my first of it's kind.  At time of writing this, my only other experience is just past beating Ornstein and Smough in DS1. (after beating ER)  I see why so many love that fight.

But this is a review for Elden Ring, so I'll stay focused on this game.

Lastly, before you enter this world, there's a few more things you need to know.
1. Don't attack the guy who calls you maidenless.  You can kill him later if you really want to, but trust me, you aren't ready. (he's got some good quest rewards too)
2. Bladd is best boy.
3. Hewg deserves all of the love.

Now, rise, ye Tarnished.  Rise and journey to stand before the Elden Ring... and become the Elden Lord.
And don't you dare go hollow.
10/10 game
boowomp.
not that hard of a game, lightwork no reactionü•±
very hard but fun

nice game :3
First half of the game is enjoyable but after [spoiler] Mountaintops of Giants [/spoiler] there is a huge power spike on enemies, as they have lots of more health and damage. You might wonder if you skipped some "expected route" areas but the power spike is noticeable even when you explore most content available at that point of the game. After that area, enemies are scaling up faster than you can level up your own character and strong enemies start to come in packs. I have had those +2/+3 resistance amulets for magic and/or physical damage equipped but my health pool could have lasted only 3 hits instead of 2 but those number don't really matter on bosses when they can have 5-7 hit combos.

Huge bosses could be fine by themselves if the camera could be further away from the player character on those fights. Now you are mostly fighting against the camera and trying to predict attacks only from their audio queues. Some mandatory end game bosses also have immunity to many status effects or their threshold is very high which ruins a bit the RPG element of the game.

I have completed the game once, almost second time after 1.5 years from the launch but the end game experience is still the same, unfortunately. Going through areas at and after [spoiler] Mountaintops of Giants [/spoiler] still makes the game a chore to go through. On my second playthrough I lost all the interest to finish the final boss after fighting 2 mandatory bosses back to back.

I had the DLC on wishlist but not anymore, as I can see the player experience haven't improved on the main game through these years...
very nice
Turns out this game is good actually, who knew
I did it, O I did it!
:)
Yes, please!
Do it for Ranni
◊ò◊ï◊§

cant sex melina.
good game
Best game I ever played although my all time favourite game is Sekiro, I will always say Elden Ring is the best game in history.
I love games with a happy ending. Full of joy that make me look at the world more positively. However, I am playing Elden Ring. All in all, after 300+ hours, I'm not complaining. But since the DLC is coming out soon, I'll ask for a happy ending for Blaidd. Best boy in ER deserves more!
Anyone who describes this game as story rich is a bald-faced liar. There's a lot of LORE (you know, in the background) but nothing approaching a cohesive story. The NPCs are dull, wooden, and uninteresting. Everything I love about RPGs has been haphazardly hacked off leaving only a bunch of unrelated boss fights separated by lots of pointless nothing. I went into this game with an open mind, having never played any of the original Dark Souls games and wanting to see what people loved about this formula. I was not impressed.
the game make me know that i'm a punk
simga
GOOD GAME MAKES ME CRY THO BUT GOOD GAME LOVE IT
Right outside the Chapel of Anticipation by the cliff is a message. Clicking on it will say ‚ÄúJumping Required Ahead‚Äù with an emote pointing down. I was the true first boss for over a hundred people. 

10/10
This is my first souls game and I am hooked. Highly recommended.
this is fire
Yippee
Family friendly, cosy and chill

10/10 

Idk this game does not contain enough feet like miyazaki enjoys, but i guess the game itself is good. Miyazaki, if you could make sure that Shadow of the Erdtree has more feet in it, and maybe like 3 swamp maps? I'd really appreciate that. Other than that you could for sure put like 1k hours in this game, if you try to ignore the fact that you dont really see that many feet. Like seriously? Fingers? why would you go to fingers, theres like no fetish audience for fingers.
tuff
Oiled up blacksmith
Have all i like about souls games and more
Yes: more Fromsoftware.

No: Open world aspect makes the level design less tight and sometimes feels rather empty and bland.
its ok
100% would recommend to any Souls-like fan
A great challenging game. Was hooked from the get go. Can not wait for the DLC to drop in June.
yes
this game so sigma
Best game
what are you waiting for, just play it already
well its solid souls game and since its the first open world souls game it does lack in some areas and such but not that bad. solid 8/10 meow
Ahh, I knew you'd come.

To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.

What a sad state of affairs.

I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.

Queen Marika has high hopes for us.

That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.
good
A masterpiece... that is the only word that can be used to describe the game. The world is vast,open and its so free. The unhindered exploration of being able to come to any area again and the element of surprise is what makes this game what it is. So for those of you who have not tried it yet, i can only state that you are missing out on a wonderful experience
Its elden ring what can i say, best soulslike so far.
really good
One of the best I ever played in my life
best
This is a 10/10 game, The first game that actually made me 100% it and it was worth it. Its got lore, its got action, its got character development, its got cameos what else could you want! Buy it full price, buy it on sale it doesn't matter the game is a masterpiece!
i love ketamine
best game ive ever played hard but definitely worth it
I love this Game.
The Fallen Leaves Tell A Story
Introduced me to the Souls genre. Thank you, Elden Ring.
I buy every Fromsoft game twice, one for solo play on Playstation and one for multiplayer on PC, this game is no exception. Also if youve started with ER, please go back and play the older games, you'd be really cool and epic if you did
A bit late to the party - like 2 years - but this game has taken over my life :)

Words are not enough to express how amazing everything in this game is. Definitely buying the expansion
Dont play this game when u have anger issues, the game itself costed me 39‚Ç¨ additional cost was 400‚Ç¨ for a new monitor üôå
One of the best games ever made.
The good content is drowned in copy-paste-content, just too many reused bosses.
LET ME SMASH MARIKA ONG
me like
I hid behind my giant shield and poked things to bleed and rot death and maybe frost idk it's been a while

10/10
Dark Souls again
This game is one of the best games i've ever played, the story is so captivating and every boss makes me determined to beat them. I played 139 hours of this game and i'm only 30% done with it. But, when you make it to end game, the game gets boring and to repetitive. The bosses and story is so good and make me look into it so much. The lore is lengthy but great, the PVE is amazing. But once again, there is so much content but most of it is reused, idc tho ima get the DLC. Overall, in my top 10 of all time.
This reminds me of a Big Bang Theory Episode
Stunning game.
No longer maidenless. <3 Thanks to Ranni I can uninstall
bonk
This is a really good introduction to FromSoft's games. I've given up on Dark Souls 1, 2, and Sekiro; this is the first one I've beaten. The open world encourages you to just go somewhere else if you're stuck in one spot, and it can be pretty fun to look around.
don't play mage, embrace strength
valid
BAD GAME
it gud
Wow, what a beautiful game. From the visuals, to the music, to the voice acting..it was an amazing journey. You only get one first playthrough, so take your time to enjoy the ride! Looking forward to the DLC :)
still maidenless but worth the free hugs
frienziedmaxxingüî•
a woman talk to me for the first time
lmao how u make a game that lags more than cyber punk
Elden Ring  is one of my favorite soulsborn games. It offers a fun open world experience unlike any other souls game the bosses are so much fun and the experience is amazing. the challenge and difficulty is also another great part about the game. over all I love this game and would play again, definitely worth the price
hard
The most unnecessarily hard game ever that I, for some reason, still like. There is a unique sense of satisfaction you get when beating that boss that's been murdering you for the last hour that you only get from this kind of game. Great combat and world design, but so very obtuse with its quests.
i had over 300 hours on my ps4 and its still amazing on here
Exciting, challenging and fun! =D
perfect, beautiful, amazing the greatest game of all time
Big bonk, big blast, big buff... what more could you want?
j
i love no being abel to see my kids because i cant kill godrick
Its fun would recomend
some bosses are unplayable because of how laggy they are not just for me but a variety of people ive played with
good game but hard
got to play as a magic girl 101/10 ps seamless co op is cool
int guy
Greatsword big. Greatsword chop. Greatsword great.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmboo
Let me just say, I absolutely love this game! It is incredibly fun, its got an AMAZING open world, enjoyable content, a story line, Ranni, and so much more! Some people may be hesitant to play the game due to its difficulty, but I will say this. Even though the game can be difficult, it doesn't have to be you can over level, get better weapons, get talismans, or call in someone else to do it for you. I do acknowledge that over leveling and gathering equipment can take time but there are ways to get millions of runes quickly very early on into the game, and you can always look up guides if you choose to, that's all to say, most challenges can be made less challenging if you choose to make it so.
short game
easy to
It's pretty good.

It could use more dragon boss fights though.
absolute masterpiece
its okay
80 bucks to make me wanna kms, so worth it

first time playing a souls game, and i was worried i wouldnt like it because of the difficulty but the open world really helps with that, if im struggling with a boss i just go level up for a bit and explore. honestly its become one of my all time favorite games, tons of options for play style allowing for endless replay- ability. every victory feels earned/ gives a great sense of accomplishment and im in love with the online but simultaneously single player feel that the messaging system gives (a very unique but really great feature, i hope to see more games do something similar tbh.) 
overall 100/10, great game and very much enjoying every part of it! :)
just got past the first boss, it's alright ig
This game makes me want to blow my brains out. 10/10
godskn duoi
The game has difficult moments but has some great mechanics to seek help. Its a great way of dipping your toes into the Souls series.

i spent 4 hours trying to kill the first enemy (i won)
Every night before I sleep I go on my knee's and pray to the god's at FromSoftware Inc;

"Please I pray to you, I want Luminary Mohg all to myself. I want him to whisper NIHIL into my ear before taking me into his long arms. My dear dear Mohg, choose me over Miquella. Let ME be the blood of your Dynasty. Fromsoftware Inc, let us tarnished have what we've wanted since leaving the dank crypt of the Fringefolk Hero's Grave! LET US BETROTH MOHG! I wish to feel his touch, not only through NIHIL, but through an act of sensual love! Please! Please I beg!"
best game EVER
Have Been Stuck On Soldier Of Godrick Haven't Even Got To See The Ourside Yet
An amazing experience both solo and coop (with the seamless mod)
It's alright
Great game
it's peak as a single player game. 

multiplayer is absolute trash. unbalanced, unprofessional, antiquated systems. 
there is no coop experience, there is only pvp experience. 
and if you try to do an overworld boss with other players, someone will come in with instant kill weapons and ruin it + spam you will emotes. 
this is my first souls-like game and i highly recommend it if you are a beginner. it is difficult but it's really fun and addicting as well.
I had trouble starting, but once I got into it it was hard to stop. Incredible game.
beat boss, get dopamine
FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL! BEAARR WITNESSS!!
best game of all time

yeah its a pretty good game
Only people that can beat bosses like this are the Avengers....and me
Great game, you know it's hard going in but it is fair with it's brutalness.
100% on xbox, platinum on psn, now i must become apart of the pc master-race and truly master this game everywhere it can be played ( doing this with sekiro too.) i honestly love this game. a bit of advice it doesn't matter what class you start ass just build everything to an even level like 20 then go to specialize each stat after.

One of best gaming experiences in my life.
It got Good
Victim Simulator
Best game ive ever played for sure
Very rare that you get played by the video game. Humbling and rewarding experience 10/10
yes
One of the best from-soft games, it is more fun multiplayer with discord unless you want the in depth lore experience. Would recommend to anyone that likes a challenge in the gaming world 11/10.
FromSoftware took all of the good ideas,mechanics and some of the content (weapons, skills, some npcs) of their other games, added much more of it, added an open-world, their best bosses yet, smart QOL features, a horse, a jump button and joined it all together to make this fine game.
It's their biggest, most epic and hardest Action RPG yet.

Pros:
- Giant fantasy world thats fun to explore and filled with tons of secrets (maybe to the point of it being detrimental)
- Subtle guidance throughout the world makes for puzzling navigation which amplifies immersion and non-combat engagement
- Refined gameplay, with much freedom of expression
- Massive enemy variety, with bosses being the highlights
- Beautiful art style and graphics
- Beautiful music, sound design and voice acting
- Clever integration of lore into gameplay mechanics
Cons:
- Not the best performance
- Some 'copy-pasted' mini-bosses and caves here and there

Apparently the story and lore are great, but you won't figure out much unless you go full nerd and read item description and replay the game 5 times.
The game is sometimes too subtle about guiding you, to the point of missing huge chunks of content if u didn't talk twice to an NPC or missed some random item or something. But i guess it also adds to the replayability.
The online features are interesting, it's the same old Dark Souls formula. I'd recommend leaving online mode disabled for first playthrough cause the messages are too distracting and can spoil you sometimes.

Very good game Dev just sucks at it
Horrible Parry timings. Never had a game with such a delay on parries.
I have nothing against the difficulty of this game since I have beaten a game mod arguarbly as hard as this - Terraria Calamity Infernum on master difficulty which isnt even allowed by the mod
its cool
goat
This is a game I sing the praises of whenever its brought up in discussion. The game is a wonderful RPG with definite challenges therein. If you're into tight and responsive action games, then this is definitely the game for you.

10/10 game. It might be glazing but i don't care because as long as the games they make continue to be as good as they are now i will continue to spend every penny on this franchise until the day i die. thank you fromsoft for creating such beautiful games!!!
Awesome game
Like =) Malenia, Blade of Miquella the best
Great world, okay bosses, unfair fights. Builds are dull and often end at "equip this weapon and armour then stack this stat"

It's better than dark souls, but it's just not quite there for a universal recommendation. anyone into souls will probably love elden ring
this game sucks dont plauy
Classic FromSoft
missing this bih already so im downloading it again...
roll
Solid game. Some elements didn't flow as well as DS3, but other aspects easily make up for it, and cooperative play is the most painless I've seen from any FromSoft game. If you like the Souls games, Elder Scrolls is absolutely a great successor, well-deserving of the attention received.
hhhhh
awesome
Played through it 13 times. Not bad
As my first Souls game, I went in expecting to die a lot. And that did happen. But the world is also gorgeous. Combat is intuitive. Every time I thought I was getting close to finished with the game, a whole new region would be unlocked.
Amazing Souls game.
Best Fantasy RPG I have played to date

.
This has become my favourite game. It is almost perfect. I'd say it's the first game in many years that has given me the same feelings i felt when i first started playing video games. The game forces you to challenge yourself and face it's adversity. You will die, and you will fail. But you can always stand up and try again. And when you finally succeed, you feel an intense rush and a deep sense of satisfaction. The progression comes mainly from you getting good with the mechanics and reading of the enemies patterns but you do become stronger overall with the various material upgrades. Coming back to the first area with an endgame character makes you feel like you got stronger, not only in level but in skill too. The story is grandiose, melancholic, full of symbolism and isn't given to you. You have to search the world and interact with it to try to understand it. The story kind of becomes your story, as what you find and how you tend to see things generally will deeply influence your interpretation of it. The only bad thing i can say about this game is that the discovery aspect suffers on successive playthroughs. I wish i had a reset button so i could experience this game again for the first time. Thank you FromSoftware. Keep doing what you do.
The best
I do not like most open world games, a lot of the time it feels way too empty and soulless. The industry trend is to inundate you with countless collectables and systems to keep you playing constantly.

But Elden Ring is different. Sure there are some areas that feel a bit empty, not every location is as rigorously planned as their linear games, but it all feels good.

The world is beautiful, many times I would just vibe and look out at the environment. The combat is still just as good as previous games, but I personally feel that it's gotten better. I'm a simp for parries, guard counters are a fantastic addition that gives that "counter" feeling without as much risk.

I would go into more detail, but if anyone is interested in the game, I'd say just pull the trigger and play.
Godfrey is papi.
One of the best games if you are maidenless
Maliketh shit boss
Great game if you like to die.. a lot.. over.. [i]and over.[/i]. again.. [b][i]*sigh*[/i][/b]
10/10 would recommend
my pc cant handle this game
I want ranni to peg me, while she holds me down with 2 arms and strokes me with the other 2
Just the best soulslike I have ever played. A true masterpiece indeed. Can't wait for the release of the DLC.
This game is like getting pegged. You may not like it the first time, or the second time, but by the third time you realise you're starting to enjoy it and it becomes concerning because now you can't go back to regular sex.
11/10, Caelid crows and dogs best bosses in the game
THE GREATEST, Try finger.
Dog
Best game ever
edlen ring
My friend meat rides this game, its mid asf fr.
best game
After 300 hours on both PC and console as well as completing every game in the soulsbourne series I can say this is the best one in the series. Truly a masterpiece from the game play and level design to the music and enemy/boss design. The lore is extremely in depth and it is a ton of fun to put the pieces together through dialogue with the NPC's and reading the item descriptions. Overall an incredible experience and something that I believe can only be improved through the addition of the Shadow of the erdtree DLC. Do yourself a favor and truly give this game a chance. You will not be disappointed.  Now go show Gideon Ofnir that a tarnished truly has what it takes to become a lord.
great game
This game epitomizes the psychopathic saying of "I'd bring you back to life, just to kill you again."
Also, the scenery is gorgeous.

182/182 would recommend
The controls are clunky, you die a million times for no reason, you have to run a lot after dying, the camera is awful, if you use controller you have to hold sprint so you can't move the camera around, and if you switch to mouse then you have to open settings and toggle the UI and auto camera when it should automatically detect, and to play multiplayer takes a million mods, there's no dualshock 4 UI, it's unclear how to use the systems, the dialogue and lore makes no sense, the world feels dead, and your movements, attacks and the enemy telegraphs are all very slow, and the game is locked at 60 fps
Absolute cinema of a game
beautiful game 10/10 highly recommended
[h1] A masterpiece, still standing tall in a sea of mediocrity and woke pandering [/h1]
[b]Behold, Megatron's Assessment of Elden Ring[/b]

Decepticons and Autobots alike, brace yourselves for an analysis of the revered masterpiece, "Elden Ring." In an era overrun by the mindless babble of woke AAA titles, and unlike the modern woke developers spreading an ideology that makes no sense in the eyes of true gamers, this 2022 gem stands resolute, a testament to true gaming artistry.

[h2]The Challenge of Mastery[/h2]

Elden Ring beckons warriors with a challenge unlike any other. It's not just about mastering mechanics; it's a test of sheer willpower. Prepare to face countless defeats, yet rise again, drawn by the allure of conquest and growth.

[h2]Exhilarating Combat[/h2]

In the crucible of combat, every move is a dance with death. The stakes are high as you strive to avoid the ultimate consequence‚Äîlosing precious runes. This currency fuels your journey, a constant reminder of risk and reward.

[h2]Vast and Inviting World[/h2]

Venture into a sprawling realm, ripe for exploration and conquest. Elden Ring offers an expansive landscape teeming with formidable adversaries and hidden secrets. Its enduring graphics elevate immersion, defying the march of time.

[h2]A Masterpiece Amidst Mediocrity[/h2]

FromSoftware's creation exemplifies the pinnacle of game development. Amidst an industry plagued by virtue-signaling and pandering, Elden Ring remains a beacon of excellence‚Äîan art form untainted by hollow agendas.

[h2]The Joy of Fellowship[/h2]

Unleash the full potential of Elden Ring by traversing its perilous domain with a trusted comrade. Together, the adrenaline-fueled adventure becomes even more exhilarating, forging unforgettable memories.

In the realm of Elden Ring, challenges abound, but so do triumphs. This is not merely a game; it's an odyssey‚Äîan epic that will endure in the annals of gaming history. Join the fray, and let the saga unfold.

Great game, probably my favorite game of all time

challenging and fun
Before Elden Ring I never truly was able to get into the Souls series but now after playing it, not only have I grown to hold this series dearly but have 100% Elden Ring and finished Dark Souls 1 and 3 with 2 next. 

Elden Ring is truly a masterclass in open world, art style, commitment, and design. One of the best and most beautiful games I have ever played. I highly recommend even if you've never played a Soulsborne game before. Yes it is difficult and you will have to adapt, but to do so is to experience one of if not the greatest game made.

100/10  Cant wait to get destroyed by the DLC!
Incredible game‚Ä¶BUT I am experiencing a debilitating bug on Deck after you hit the snow area where I repeatedly lose all controller input and have to force quit the game (risking losing progress).  Google says this is a known issue since 2022 with fire giant.  This game should not be verified until it is fixed.

I‚Äôm going to finish on gaming PC‚Ä¶but I want to play it on Deck, I play muchhhh better on Deck for whatever reason.  It is frustrating to have to switch controllers (and muscle memory). I will reverse review if bug is fixed.
Great!!!!
nice
Bacon Ring
!
Yes
Got good
please play it is fun
Very good
Really good souls type game for new players that don't like the Linearity of regular soul maps. This is a open world game and was really fun endless hours of new content and massive repeatability due to different classes and game endings
LIVE. DIE. LIVE AGAIN. WITNESS ME!
I am not the biggest fan of "Souls-like" combat and gameplay, but the world is so interesting in this one that it keeps me playing until now.
very good!
not much more needs to be said tbh. Greatest of all time
This game is excelent, much netter than Darksouls series.
I prefer the Dark Souls franchise.
super fun if you like a challenge. Easier than dark souls
I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.
Pretty Good.
Great game, beautiful lore, excellent characters. So much fun, unique build/weapon diversity. Story line and characters are amazing. George R Martin (game of thrones books and first 5 tv seasons it was based after) did an amazing job building a world that rivals the Game of Thrones world. Never played a game like this with this kind of story and characters. There's no other game like it. Plus Fromsoftwares amazing game play and massive open world. Must play game. Potentially best game ever. Highly recommend and I'm not usually a fan of this type of game.
Best souls game I have ever played even if I only bought it a week ago, fantastic story, great game play and so much content to explore. Some characters are very easy to edge to (+1 point) 9.8 out of 10
dark souls 2 is still better but this is very close
commander niall likes the tarnished's muddy toes
if radagon has no haters then im dead
Game of the century!
Cmon
best game ever
best game ever made. for some insane reason ive been putting these games off growing up. i have a lot to catch up from
nice
gud gaem!
Best game
amazing game
One of the greatest games every made. Super fun with the Seamless Co-Op mod
makes me hard
Greatest souls-like FromSoft game that isn't Dark Souls or Bloodborne.
One of the best open world games out there.
VERY GOOD UPPA TARNISHED
amazing game 10/10 absolutely loved it
amazin
i like it Big Time
Slightly easier than ds3
I would liken this to beating your head against a brick wall until either you or the wall breaks, it is very rewarding when the wall goes down, but sometimes the wall wins.
where is my ring?
You have been invaded by TV's Philip Foreskin
luv it
Amazing game, only critiques i have are the amount of the wiki you have to use and the damage on some attacks seems a little unfair, espeically when their attack timing is somewhat unintuitive. However thats probably just skill issue. Other than that.... The game is beautiful, most bosses are quite cool and well designed.  The world is really cool and well designed for the most part. A bunch of places you can stumble across and explore but I feel like as previously mentioned.... The wiki shouldnt be required to even get most of the endings.
is good
Gracias por este increible juego. 
Intenta con dedo
malenia is cutting off my balls bro
really good game
best game multiplayer is ah tho
Immersive experience
yes
Totally worth it if you liked dark souls at all. Its totally different, but with the good things we are familiar with from dark souls.
Very nice
It's beating my ass
very fun game, i really suck at it but its still great.
10/10
Elden Rang is the best game ever made...
Played for a couple of hours, pretty good game.
Makes me want to bang my head against the wall. 10/10 would recommend
It is hard, you have to be a masochist to enjoy this game, but it is fun.
Malenia should've been a romance option!!!! GRRRRRRR WHY NO MALENIA ROTUSSY ROMANCE AWOOGAAA NO AGOOGAW BAZOONGAAAS
This is game is so Fun! must try it.
Hard game, deep lore, amazing graphics, fun fights. 
and dogs
Great game
dark souls 2 > elden ring
best game in my life
Learning curve but free dopamine.
a lot of feets!!!
Souls players will feel right at home. The hardest part is learning to call the souls runes.
This game cured my ED
Awesome game!!!!
YES

Miyazaki and the team, they only went and made another masterpiece *chefs kiss*
it's alright
so good
gg
very silly
The game is hard if you haven't played any Dark Souls games before. It's beautiful and rich in lore. I have a lot of fun playing it.
makes my dong go boing boing
good game
elden ring 2
Invader in coop ruin the fun , try to understand and appreciate the game from lvl 1 to 20 as a new player with friends and being killed every 15 min by invader is not fun at all . Now that i know that every soulgame have that kind of coop mecanic  ill never buy that again .
very challenging but nice to play
everything is great
based
As someone who has never played a Sould game, the difficulty of this game is overrated. I've fought bosses in Oldschool Runescape that are more difficult and require more attention than a majority of the bosses in this game. When you do get to a challenging boss fight, the game really shines. Overall great game, would recommend but a bit easier than expected. If you disagree, git gud.
no blaidd sex >:(
goated game
It's alright I guess.
it's alright
For Real Gamers
Good game!
I really enjoyed a large majority of the game, but a lot of bosses near the end suck so much ass that it almost killed all of the fun for me. Still good overall though
This game is visually stunning, the gameplay was challenging enough to make me mad at times, but also gave me so much joy after finally completing an objective. My favorite game.
stunning
Best game of the decade.
fun, yet time consuming.
I will keep it short, elden ring is a masterpiece
i die i like
dis how new games shuld be
Mid Game
Fun game. Needs a hard mode tho.
i hate that fucking dragon
cheeseburger
beautiful but scary to fight a big boss
Shing Shing Shing, Bonk, Pew Pew
I was not a Souls player at first, I actually hated it. I didn't really have the patience to learn attack patterns or even had the attention span for an open world. However, after playing a smaller Souls-like game that was smaller/linear that I really enjoyed, I learned patience and decided to give Elden Ring another try (especially after seeing the DLC trailer). Now I'm at 250+ hours, 3 characters in, and I'm still craving for more.

If you're patient, willing to learn attack patterns/play smart, and enjoy a diverse open world, this is THE game. Can't wait to try the other Souls-borne/Souls-like games out there after this.
is this dog?
super good game
A pinicle of slouls games!
Never played a souls game (on a serious level) before. This was the first one and I was captivated by the beauty of it. Highly recommended!

And remember, you only loose when you give up, not when you die to a boss.
You are dead (again). You'll love this if you are looking for a beautiful open world game that is quite challenging but one that offers many opportunities to improve your character if you ever find yourself out of league in battle.
kicks your ass like unlike your dad who was restricted by law
Good Game
game gud
I'm not going to write why Elden Ring is good because its been done and done before. Just play the game and see for yourself.
Still no maiden
very good
Game of the decade.
Ridiculously hard but ridiculously good, loved it.

Amazing Game üëçüëçüëç
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!!!!!
i like poo
Iz good
Best Open World game I ever played.
I would say that this game is amazing and you should buy it but I would just be repeating everyone else's opinions
Most fun Fromsoft game. A blast trying out all the builds you can use.
Haven't played anything better
Not as good as DS3. Movement is all floaty and NPC sidequests are cryptic and hard to find.
Beautiful, engaging, challenging.
Me and my friend struggled on ancestor spirit for about 5 hours. Good game.
ive heard more "i am malenia, blade of miquella" than anything else this year
Elden Ring is maybe the best game I've ever played. The game can be hard for less experienced players, and death should be expected. But there's always somewhere else to go if you feel under-leveled. Be aware that the story is very obscure. Much is either environmental storytelling or found in item descriptions. And there's a deep rabbit hole to go through if you want to understand it. But that's probably why so many love this game. Unlike other modern games, Elden Ring rarely holds your hand. There's no sidekick repeatably saying where you should go and what you should do. Just follow the guidance of grace, explore and fight until you become the Elden Lord.¬†

Very good game
Bad game
arguably the best game of all time in every single aspect.
Slay your enemies
.
Phenomenal game, with a tremendous amount of replay value by itself, and even more so if you jump into some of the gameplay overhaul mods. 10/10
.
My first souls game 
started a dual katana andy 
ended a faith strength user and it was quite the journey, best game ever!
I'm terrible at this type of game, but thanks to the numerous cheese and grind options I can still enjoy it :>
yudie
everything is amazing
don't look for negative reviews the game is perfect
Hard. But fun.

Improvement Feedback: Make Leonine Misbegotten drop a guaranteed "old fang." Make Demi-human Chief drop a guaranteed "string", and increase drop chance of "string" from regular demi-human. Increase the drop chance of "budding horns" from Ancestral Follower Shaman and Ancestral Follower. Make "formic rock" respawnable as it is a common material due to the background color indication. Make boss gauntlet. Make an item that signals Torrent to attack. Allow Torrent to be used against The Elden Beast. Allow us to use the same spell/incantation in multiple slots.
CERTIFIED MEDIEVAL CLASSIC
Take the throne take the crown, Thous are given the seeds of gold to start anew age that welcome us all
lost the vibe of souls games tbh
this shit mean something
anger issues therapy
10/10 a great game with amazing music
best game i played in a long time (except hades II)
I spent 100 hours on this mf
Just amazing
favourite game :3
Just keeping Fromsoft humble is all üëÄ
Really enjoyed this game. Played a few From Software games before and this is one of my favorite. Easy to pick and get into.


This Game Continues to be one of my favorite titles.  The Game is a lot more forgiving than previous souls titles in the sense that the game makes you learn from your mistakes.  I would say if you enjoy good combat and lore to give this one a go.
great gameplay, really cool fights
very good polished game!
Waaaaaaaaay too long, but also amazing...
i like this game alot, it doesnt make me wanna kermit sewerslide like paladins from goddamn 7-11 like holy moly
goodd
ÿÆŸäÿßÿ≥
all my summons are autistic
Fantastic game!
Ill f*ck Blaidd, Sexy wolf boyfriend, yes please <3
GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME .
IT ACTUALLY CHANGED MY LIFE
Though its pretty hard the game wants you to explore and get stronger so I think its pretty fun
incredable
Is okay
DS3 Better >>>>>
Deserved Game of the year 2022
The only thing missing here is a cute "Firekeeper" that you can emote with, like in Dark Souls 3.
One of the greatest game I've ever played. Can't wait for the DLC to come out
i mean... its elden ring.
Fun
HANDS DOWN BEST GAME EVER
yes
its 100% a challenging game but its so addicting, amazing combat, beautiful music, and a breath taking environment
smurfs are hot
Elden Ring O Elden Ring...
It's amazing.
In a world where "every" game is easy, because developers are afraid people won't play it, Elden Ring chooses to be challenging. I love that.
this became my favorite game of all time. Though the elden beast is a underwhelming fight
Do i need to spell it, it's the G-O-A-T
best hard game

Breath of the wild but harder
its ight
Only now do you understand the power of the elden ring
Malikith is the easiest boss in the game!!!!!
needs a couple more deathblight swamps imo
LITERALLY PERFECT. Never played a souls game before this and my life is forever altered by this game. This game is filled with the love and dedication of every artist, developer, writer, actor, and everybody else who worked on it. It is a masterpiece of game design, storytelling, world-building, and visual-auditory art. I played around 250 hours of the game on Xbox One, before playing it here, and the only problem I have with the game is that it suffers from some optimization issues. Regardless, these issues rarely rear their head. Amazing game, I'm begging Miyazaki for more.
This game sucks, I love it.
game is amazing

confusion simulator 
10/10 would recommend
S tier game
Its a good game but its hard for first time players
Meh.
yes
has the worst learning curve out of any game ever. idgaf if yall hate on me.
Its so well crafted. Its smooth. Its fun. Its hard. Its worth the 300+ hours
very good game
insane
Amazing
Masterpiece
goat
Try finger, but hole
Best Gaming Experience out there, however, nerf soldier of godrick
did not expect to have this much fun
Best game ever
good game
128 hours
Damn
its ok
Game fun. Try Finger.
I have given thee courtesy enough
i suck
Jog√£o
If you liked the Dark Souls games, its more of that. Very well made and satisfying
good game ahead
bonk
Absolutely amazing in almost every aspect.
I loved just exploring the world.
Kinda wished all the dungeons and caves were marked though. As some who likes to do all the optinal stuff in most games, finding everything here was a pain even with a guide.

Still a 10/10 game.
Game is hard but fun hard.
Oh death, become my blade once more.
                                           -Soldier of Godrick
Best game of the decade. Lets you play as you want, game is as easy or as difficult as you make it. Epic world with even better combat. Highly recommended for everyone, even people who usually don't play Dark Souls type of games. The difference here is the open world allows new players to go out and get stronger if they hit a roadblock, something not really possible in Dark Souls. 

Everyone should play this game.
this game sucks im stuck on soldier of godrick
Best game ive ever played
What else do you need to know at this point.  It's a From Software game so you know it's quality.  Just play it already.
Ah-ah-ah, may chaos take the world!

I think that this is a fantastic game that I will definitely sink more time into, especially with the dlc around the corner.

I do have to say though, that the fact that sprint and roll are bound to the same button input no matter what is extremely stupid. I know there's probably a game balance reason for it, but it makes learning how to dodge in this specific game, more of a chore than other games, because your dodge input only goes through after you release the button, and also only going through if your input was short enough to not start sprinting. This leads to rolling feeling unresponsive/delayed when you start playing the game for the first time, which just causes frustration and probably leads to more players getting "filtered" than otherwise would have been, all because of a poor design choice. I may hate Destiny 2, but the fact that it deals with keybinds better than Elden Ring is kinda disappointing.
yes but they should add to the godes of rot boss fight malenia jiggle effects
yea its alrite
yes
Great game!
Very addictive
Large open world with lots to do
pretty challenging game but not quite as hard as Dark souls
If you like Dark Souls you will like this 
Only thing I don't care much for is the way they set up the Co op and the level scaling system seems to either be broken or is just dumb. It is very difficult to understand the way it all works especially when people are new to the game.

I will just leave this like here.
Spawn, die, get told you have no b*tches, fight guy on horse, die, respawn, fight the guy again for another hour, realise you don't need to fight him yet, continue to fight him anyway, finally beat him, after another 3 hours. 10/10 would waste my time fighting tree sentinal again
Boring & overrated. I regret buying this, I forced myself to play through it because the world is somewhat interesting but I got to Leyndell and can't take it anymore. This game can't be played without a wiki. It's designed to waste your time.

It's just an arcade boss fighting simulator which is not what I was looking for. 5/10
GOOD
easiest game of my life
Died 50 times on a dungeon to get a dogass talisman 10/10
i like game. game good. shadow of big tree pls
Fun game with great graphics and engaging combat
The idea of open world Dark Souls was exciting to me. Unfortunately, this was better as a concept than in implementation. The maps really needed another pass by a heavy handed editor. This should mean that I liked the mini dungeons, but the tombs and mines were poorly designed as well, feeling repetitive after the first one. Additionally, many of the enemies are repetitive and, worse, are less creative than previous games. None of this compares to the excellent layout and creativity of OG Dark Souls.

Do not fall for the hype. Elden Ring, while a decent game, is nothing special. It really feels like the B team phoned this one in.
nice! Tarnished
yah
Ooga booga stick goes bonk
would recommend, although there is no brolaire
There's a very large audience for this game, and i'm not going to call this game bad, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is new to the souls like category like I am. This game isn't fun at all. I struggled so hard with the first two hours of playing it, that I don't even want to know what the rest of the game is like. The difficulty of the enemies is way too hard for just having stepped out of the tutorial cave.  I feel like maybe the first enemies you fight should maybe be easier to ease you into the game instead of 100% difficulty right off of the bat. The game doesn't give you one single quest marker, no idea where to go or what to do. The only people who like this game, hate themselves because I can think of many better games to play, and uses of my time. Hopefully I can get my money back. I would definitely recommend you to stay away from this title unless you want to spend hours learning random enemies combos so that on the 100th attempt you can finally kill them, and then gain nothing from it.
I am the lord of all that is golden.
game of the decade
every game should aspire to make a visually brilliant, functional, well thought out game like this.

             ^_^
get sword, go shwing, beat gaem 10/10
This is my first experience with a souls title (aside from about 6 hours with DS1) and I've gotta say, it's incredible. Just purchased DS3 and I can't wait to play.
Solid.
Trash game, what a fuckin dissapointing shit, been playing since demon souls, but this game is just a boring snooze, fest everything oneshots, everything has a 10000 hit combo, everything cheeses you, so the game results in using ashes boring sad infuarinting gameplay

What a fuckin let down
This game makes me feel so many emotions, most of them is frustration, but i just cant get away from it
game good
very good
Getting destroyed by big angry men but make it fun.
great game
meow
My boyfriend put me on a few days ago and man he‚Äôs getting it tonight 10/10
The game play is very close to Dark souls 3.
You feel the adventure when explore the huge map.
The map design is topnotch with uneven and memorable part.
Boss are really good they cool and fun to fight.
Some say there are difficulty spike, i'm not feeling that but keep in mind.
Yes there are reuse boss but that not offend me or anything.
I don't think this game is too hard at all but a challenge for sure.
One of my favorite game 10/10 For me.
Ive never wanted to jump off a bridge more would definitely recommend

Incredibly amazing! I believe this has the most rewarding exploration of any game in existence. So much secrets to uncover and challenges to endure. One of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had. I can't wait for Shadow of the Erdtree. From Software is top tier.
Of course thumbs up, how silly.
best game
This game is incredible. There's a reason it won game of the year!
ROTTEN GYAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Game so good it cured my cancer but gave me depression intead

Pls be on sale once in your life time!! Still a good game.
banger [nemam stul]

If this game was a play, it would make Shakespeare jealous, the pure lore of every unique enemy and character is outstanding, great storytelling, worldbuilding, bosses etc. Without a doubt, the greatest game of all time

At first, I had no idea what to do, or where to go, and the game did not really explain much but dam once I got into the lore and understood the basics I really started to enjoy the game.  I was afraid that game would kick my ass and nuts with one kick and slap me across the face 4 times, but fortunately, I was wrong, the game is decently hard but not annoyingly hard like running across half a map after dying to a boss just to fight and die to him again. Sure there are a few things that piss me off like not being able to pause the game,  not being able to keybing everything, like why did you force me to have a map on G? Just why? But still very enjoyable, with AMAZING scenery and nature, a lot of hidden stuff, great weapons, and just EVERYTHING i mean I could sit here for another 10 minutes saying how all of the stuff this game has is great and well made. Love it. 11/10
very fun and good game
Kill big guys :3

Amazing game!
Very fun ;D
Try Finger But Hole
I ate a crab in one bite, fought a crab, got bit by multiple rabid dogs, got m*lested by a ten-armed man, consoled a crying queen, put a good friend and their horse to rest, got yelled at by an old man for being too ambitious or something, burned a tree, got brutalized by a large angry dog, got beat up by a different old man, got stung by a glowing tadpole.
Oh, and then I booted up the game and enjoyed it.
10/10 would eat crab once more
Bom pra caralho
Elden Ring is quite possibly the best Souls Like Game ever created. It's also the perfect game for beginners to the series since you can decide wether if you wanna play the game in an easy way (like with ashes for example or doing all side bosses before the main ones to level up) or play it in a hard way (without ashes). The lore behind the bosses is great and the environments are fantastic. 10/10 Game.
<3

It is a fantastic game in the Dark Souls genre of gaming.
The BEST story game ever!!
First story game i wanted to finish more than 1 time (8 times ups)
this game is pretty hard but it is very fun if you have played a souls game before
Masterpiece. Even better with Mods
10/10

Fantastic game, my game save of 20 hours got  lost when loading cloud data how can that hapen to so many people and steam or FromSoftware don't or can't do something about that fail. Just Safe it twice but dont overwrite a 20h gamestate with a 5h old one!!!
Its a good game, but has a lot of bullshit in it. 
Big bosses are the worst, nothing challenging about being unable to see WTF is going on
Its a masterpiece
Life Changing
fun.
Dark Souls II, but good.
bruh
yeah
Love it. Def scratches the Fantasy itch I was looking for... Looking forward to the DLC!!!
MUST PLAY GAME IN 21TH CENTURY
Game is perfect
Awesome game it's like A Link To The Past (best game EVER on the super nintendo) but 3d. Tremendous

I am yet to becocme elden ring but I am so close to not becoming elden ring i think this is 10/10 game and i think you should try become the elden ring
A hidden and underappreciated gem.
It's good
great game
best game ever lol
hadn't played for a while decided to hop on, game decided to roll back my save at least 30-60 hours. Nice
elden ring is like a call to my grandmother. always a good time with the elder
mid
So far it is good.

A little slow to start, but each time I play it I enjoy it more.
Also a very beautiful game and very huge. quite impressive.
A note about difficulty: It sure is hard (at least for me). but the difficulty feels fair most of the time. I am always learning and playing better with practice, and I find this skill progression rewarding. Still can't beat the first boss though...

More updates as I play more.


Kill things!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and free the dung eater.
How many waifu you can make in a single soul-like game?

FromSoftware : Yes
This might be the greatest game of all time
Great game
hurts my soul
GGGGGGooooooooooooooDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Corrupt files are a real problem

10/10
Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.

Beautiful game. Stunning graphics, good challenging gameplay, the community is... something else.

I 100% recommend. Even if you're not so great at games it's worth a play. You will get better eventually.
THIS GAME IS AWESOME, RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Best FromSoft Game ever made
I was/am pretty new to Soul-like games. Prior to this, I had a partial run of Dark Souls 3 (as a Pyromancer) and I gave up because I couldn't "git gud". So instead I got this game to play co-op. with the hope that maybe playing with friends would ease the pain of Soulsborne games "tough but fair" vibe. 

My first playthrough was spread out over years of casual play, here and there, when no one was online to play other games. So when I finally sat down to beat this game, something weird happened. After I had slayed the final boss and saw the credits roll, I actually wanted to play more! My thoughts must've been something like: "wait.... souls games are actually beatable? lol" 

This game is amazing and I'm surprised how deep I fell into it! And I'll definitely get Shadow of Erdtree when that drops. In the meantime, I think I'll give Dark Souls 3 another shot! :)
So sick/Great game
This Game is Fantastic.
still maidenless, but satisfied. great game
Played thru with the Co-op mod and it was one of the best times gaming I've had a few buddies I didn't have many good times to share with! Modded or not, this game was a great experience and is worth trying out once!
open world dark souls, fun!
it's awesome if I was able to kill the bosses but no it's need to be a constant grind or cheating from youtube
drfsfcgdsd
I am inspired by the dung eater. Gigachad wisdom.
Malenia, blade of my depression
Like Dark Souls but the new best Dark Souls

Like Breath of the Wild but the weapons don't break (and are all upgradable) and the shrines have cool rewards beyond raising your max hearts (Vigor) or stamina wheel (Endurance)

Would confidently call this one of the top 3 best games I've ever played
goated
Just Amazing
Try finger but whole.
YOU DIED
best to play and make sure be raday for players to
God, damn I can't wait to purchase this absolute masterpiece
hard
It was very long. Sometimes it's painful, sometimes it's fun, but it was sure a long journey.
Wow!

Where there's a golden key, there must be a golden key!
game was so hard I got hard 10/10
Lean Man and Norbert are now Elden Lords
yes
challenge ahead, therefore great time
It‚Äôs pretty good, made me gay though.
MAKES ME HARD

Truly outstanding, the best single player game I have ever played. 
Combat, Atmosphere, Grafics/Sound, Leveldesign, Build diversity 10/10 
Incredibly difficult at times, but you can alsways come back later as there is always something else to do.
Played through most of the game four times and have found serveral new things every new go-around. 
Worth every cent, and cant wait for the DLC to expand on a brilliant world with incredible story-depth if one decides to engage with it.
is good.

Yummy game
this game saved my life from my crippling overwatch addiction... thank you

One of the best games ever made! 


ok i guess
Played for about 3 months straight when game initially dropped (on xbox lol) and loved it ever since. Had to grab it on Pc before that Shadow of the Erdtree drops. easy 9/10 for me .
love it and there are some really great overhauls and mods to spice things up (big shoutout to clevers movesets)!
very hard but very fun
One of the best games i have ever played
One of the greatest games ever still makes me want to ram a glass shard in my throat

Why root-level anti cheat system ? ! Such intrusion for not to cheat, and I use cheats nevertheless.

love this game
GO(A)TY
oh, dog
This game was obviously a wild success based on sales and popular reviews. However, despite my best effort and roughly 8 hours of game time, it just doesn't seem to hold my interest. The biggest killer for me is the rapid respawn rate of just about every mob in the game. It makes me feel as though my presence in the virtual world has no lasting impact and therefore feels completely meaningless. The RPG genre has always been my favorite, and I'm an explorer and a completionist, but if everything I discover respawns or resets to the exact state it was in before I discovered it, then what's the point? The whole experience feels hollow and lacks depth. The world may be huge and there may be a plethora of content, but if my actions and choices don't have a lasting impact on the world around me then it all seems pointless.

I also find the inability to save whenever I choose to be particularly annoying. And the floating ruin fragments and other glowing items feels a bit too old-school platformer for my taste. I need enough realism in my RPG games to achieve a greater suspension of disbelief to facilitate a truly immersive experience. The Elden Ring story does not even attempt to explain a lot of the mysticism. Harry Potter is an example of a pretty wild fantasy series (one which I love), but it all comes together to create a fantastic story because it's all explained in a way that I can accept.

I think perhaps it's just the souls-games in general that simply are not my cup and tea. I'm a huge fan of the Gothic, Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Two Worlds, Elex, Baldur's Gate, and Fallout series RPGs, to name a few, but Elden Rings is simply too wildly different from what I've come to love about the genre.
10/10
I jumped into Elden Ring hoping to get what all the hype was about, especially since I've heard so much about Dark Souls. But man, it's been tough trying to love this game. Let me break down why I think it's not living up to the buzz.

Let's start with the controls‚Äîthey're just... ugh. Slow, clunky, and unresponsive. And why can't we customize them? Who came up with using 'g' to open the map and 'q' to close it? It's just weird. Plus, the 3rd person camera and auto-lock during fights which led me straight into death more times than I'd like to admit.

And don't get me started on the tutorial‚Äîor lack thereof. How am I supposed to know how to do basic stuff like two-handing a weapon or casting spells? And why doesn't the game tell you important things like not being able to swim or the need to exhaust all dialogues? Playing Elden Ring is a wiki reading simulator, which is weird for a straightforward game. 

Elden Ring's difficulty should arise from thoughtful game design that provides fair challenges instead of relying on arbitrary obstacles to provoke frustration. 

I think there's a problem with the game's design as it doesn't mesh well with the idea of an open world. Open worlds should evoke a sense of wonder, mystery, and adventure, drawing you in with captivating stories and characters. Elden Ring punishes you for exploring too far off the beaten path, making it a headache to regain lost progress. The story and characters are boring. NPCs speak in cryptic riddles, other players will make finger and butt jokes. The world doesn't provide you with a lot of interesting items, stories, or anything else than bosses for you to kill.

Graphics are also really weird and remind me of the horse drawing meme. There are some beautiful sceneries with good lighting, or monsters that look great. And there are elements that look like they were made 20 years ago.

However since the game receives a lot of praises and sold many copies I'm probably wrong and this game is just not for me.
FAKK LAVA-√òGLA. √òDELA LIVET MITT
big hammer time
why is the fire giant still in the game
W game. bosses go boom
in my opinion, one of the funnest games i've played in a long while.
bloodborne pc when?
TRY FINGER BUT HOLE
Awesome game once you get into the flow of things, only thing that annoyed me was the controls. I tried with a controller and still wanted to neck myself. If it wasn't for a script I found online that make KBM actually playable I don't think I'd have been arsed playing. 

Come on, man. You spend 1,000s of hours constructing an open world and yet leave the controls as some twenty year old brown smeared poopy rectum disaster. Just hire one fucking dude to sort out the control features in your game it really isn't a big ask.
I finished the Elden Ring game with complete pleasure and accuracy, and in this story and epic world, I got enough experience and pleasure, and I can really only say, Oh, Elden Ring! Each part of Lands between had its own story, feeling and beauty and really deserved the game of 2022! But I have a recommendation for those who have not experienced the game, that this game is not such that you can move forward and finish the game by hitting and shooting, but you should be careful enough in the boss fights and Be sure to use good weapons and spirits and enjoy this epic game! Now we have to wait for the additional content of the game that will arrive in June. Yes, Shadow of the Earth tree
She Elden on my Ring till I'm Tarnished
Greatest game of all time
Coped so hard i reinstalled DS2.
I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did. 

Turning Dark Souls into a an open world game was the biggest mistake Miyazaki has ever made. The combat is fun, but the exploration part is incredible shallow and boring. The open world approach completely kills any sense of progression, so unless you follow an online guide you're gonna end up either underlevelled or overlevelled for the boss of any given location, which throws out all the balance and fun of fighting bosses out of the window.

That being said, the unique legacy dungeons are amazing and interesting to explore, which is ever so bitter because you need to plough through a bunch of trash mobs riding a horse through vast empty fields with an occasional dragon copypasted from location to location.
great.
Git gud
Amazing game, really good graphics, would recommend. DLC coming soon :D
Jar.
Got fucked by Radahn, then fucked Malenia. The cycle of life.
Its a challenge but very great game fun and adictting
Consecutive runs after the first playthrough feel like a chore. Many locations lose their magic after the first visit. Usually entering a random dungeon doesn't reward you with anything relevant, mostly some random spirit ash. You would have to make a spread sheet to write down which locations you need for your build and skip the ones that are a waste of your time. If you aren't exploing anymore and working off of a list it becomes boring. There is no real incentive to go into a random dungeon or location besides for the sake of exploring. Explore as much as you can on your first time around.
Try finger 
But hole
what the fuck is going on bruh
time for dog
Amazing.
fun :)

Hated this game! 10/10
Initial Appeal:
The game starts off with a bang, throwing you into exhilarating boss challenges one after another. However, this excitement quickly fades as you're forced to endure an excruciating 4000 hours of tedious running or riding just to reach a mere 5-minute boss fight.

Frustrating Exploration:
To make matters worse, the game's progression is hindered by an infuriating mechanic that requires you to repeatedly roll against walls to unlock additional paths. This not only disrupts the flow of the game but also feels like an unnecessary chore.

Repetitive and Uninspired Bosses:
Despite boasting over 200 boss fights, the game fails to deliver on its promise of epic encounters. Only a handful of these bosses stand out as truly memorable, while the rest are relegated to the status of forgettable trash mobs.

Unnecessary Travel:
The game's poorly designed map further exacerbates the problem of tedious exploration. The lack of clear visual cues and intuitive navigation forces players to waste countless hours aimlessly wandering around, adding another layer of frustration to the overall experience.
Openworldish Dark Souls
Goti
I hÃµaÃµtÃµeÃµ love starting
Really good game Do NOT give up if you are stuck on a bossfight

incredible game and really interesting lore, probably one of the best in gaming history
I jerk off to margit
Best game ever made
A Very good action game. not so good of a soulsborne game. unbalanced dmg output / boss hp. poise break every 4 hit.  overused boss attack patterns. They butchered the thrill of exploration with this one, you are never in danger. game keeps giving more and more flasks. You can find a grace every 3-4 mins. Main bosses are more challenging than previous games ( not counting dlc bosses). But all main bosses have the same pattern. A Shitty first phase which u can break the poise of the boss with 3 hits, then we have the second phases with spam AOE attacks. Boss desings are amazing. there are many different areas. not any memorible areas for me tho (like Anor Londo or Irythll.) Overall a very good game. For me its probably ranked #4 on soulsborne list. Lets see what will dlc offer!
new world order w bluessy

This game can fix friendships, I love you Callum
Goated game
Though I think the hype around Elden Ring Was, (And still is), Justified. My experience with this being my first souls-like title was great at times, and unpleasant at others. My biggest issue is the balancing. I think them making this type of game in an open world setting makes it hard to balance the bosses because of the potential power you missed out on or having to much power. Most bosses are either laughable easy with summons, or impossible difficult without them. That makes it hard not to just say fuck it and summon on all the bullshit bosses the game throws at you. Summoning completley ruins the gameplay and them having to balance around them with the bosses makes people not trying to summon have a horrible time. But when the boss is fair and I don't want to summon this game is truly one of the best games I have  ever played. The world is so fun to explore and has so much hidden in it you'll probably have to play the game a couple times to see it all. This game is a must play, but be aware of the difficulty and don't be ashamed at summoning or abusing cheese strats if this is your first souls like. Have fun the way you want to.
One of the best games I've ever played.
very detailed game with a story to try and figure out
It's a perfect game for autistic people
God Midayaki
good game
Put these foolish ambitions to rest!
not dark souls 2
the best game i have ever played
hard
Amazing Game.
Beautiful.
This is a amazing game but I must give negative reviews.

EASY ANTI CHEAT, why the hell this thing exists?
Maybe there're cheaters but it doesn't worth the lags & freezing & crashes it causes.

I played arena a lot and don't care it's cheater or not. In fact, some cheaters are quite amusing.
Make this thing OPTIONAL. Not everyone cares about pvp.  Not every pvper cares about the victory.

(To disable it, you have to go offline and can't see the words of other players. Sad.)

A truly amazing open world game.
If youre a masochist then this is the game for you. All jokes aside, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time. I have over 200 hours on my play-station account and just recently started playing again with a friend whos never played

For the new players to the souls franchise: This game is hard, you will die, you will fail. But once you start understanding the basic mechanics (dodging, attack timing etc) you will be fine. This game is meant to be hard, but finally overcoming whatever obstacle in your way is very rewarding. Build your character, kill the bosses, have fun with it! 

There is nearly endless amount of content to pursue. Endless spells, incantations, swords, axes, hammers, armor sets and more. Tons of NPCs that give you quests which in turn can lead to new areas of the map, new bosses and weapons that you wouldnt normally find.

This is your adventure. Arise now, ye Tarnished, ye dead who yet live. Destroy those who stand in your way. And CLAIM YOUR THRONE
Best souls like
By FAR the best Souls game

One of the games of all time
One of the best games in existence. People who dont like Eldenring are just bad Gamers period
fun very easy non rage game

Amazing game that take me a while to finish (great durability), the community is really cool + the lore is just so good.

The best, most full fledged and accomplished game of this video game era, by a mile

By bringing narrative to new heights, and introducing a masterfully crafted open world design to the already accomplished dark souls action rpg franchise, Elden RIng has given us the pinnacle of game design, and the building stone for what we can only hope of has yet to come
Once you play this game it will ruin all other games for you.
This game changed my life
very good
Not a terrible game, but still majorly disappointing.

Major Pros:
- The game looks great, both graphically and aesthetically.
- Level design is quite good, referring specifically to the so-called "legacy dungeons" (bounded areas that behave more like traditional Soulsborne levels).

Major Cons:
- The open world of Elden Ring is a mixed bag. Nothing about it is revolutionary, despite what "mainstream" reviews may suggest. It is decently implemented, but nothing more. Some parts of the game benefit from this approach, while others suffer. Most of the world simply feels bloated and repetitive, with a great deal of space taken up by bland mini-dungeons and gratuitous re-use of bosses (even some major plot/lore bosses are inexplicably re-used throughout). The choice to make this game open world was a net negative, in my opinion.

- Boss design is... questionable, at best. The worst excesses of Dark Souls 3 have been amplified ten-fold in Elden Ring, with bosses so fast and unfairly punishing that they effectively invalidate all but the most powerful/meta of builds. The problem is mainly that the core gameplay of Soulsborne games has not been significantly improved upon since (arguably) Dark Souls 3, meaning that weapon characteristics and arts have to take up the slack. This game desperately needs a new system to master: something akin to Sekiro's parry system, perhaps. Alas, the only notable addition to this game is the ability to jump, and while that is a genuine improvement, it is far too little to keep up with the huge changes in boss and enemy design.

The end result is that Elden Ring feels more interested in build viability, rather than mechanical mastery. If you don't mind looking up meta builds on YouTube, then you may very well still enjoy this game. But in my opinion, Elden Ring is a huge step in the wrong direction. Hopefully we will see more effective innovation in FromSoft's next game.
GOOD, BUT VERY ANOYING BUT GOOD
White Ass Varre
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE.
Only thing I would like to see is unlocked framerate patch.
But overall 10/10
Would be a 10/10 if it weren't for replays in the open world being a bit dull and late game boss flow feeling unnatural.
The game is good, I had fun, and it's as good as anyone say. No need to repeat anything. I'll just mention what I didn't like instead.
It feels kinda diluted Dark Souls 1. When I was playing the game, I just had this constant itch for playing DS1. Exploring on horseback is fun, but that's kinda padding. Maybe I just prefer the much more condensed experience that DS1 or 2 offers.
good
best game ever
good game. I am officially addicted. Heads up, hella grindy
this game ate my life. once it clicks it CLICKS
grate game
If i had a cock, this game would make my wiener hard.
I don't think I've ever had a more immersive and challenging experience. Currently on my third playthough
Often better than sex, and I don't even have it.
Tarnished, are we?
This game is a masterpiece.
So far 40hrs in and havent even been to second major boss, world is massive
My friend who I play Baldur's Gate 3 with said if I post a review on Destiny 2 and it gets 2500 likes and 500 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 4070 and 2 Kilo of rice. So I'm just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha!
Peak
DO I EVEN HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING AT THIS POINT. JUST GO AND PLAY IT. GAME OF THE DECADE !!!
Just.... Amazing
good
I love video games
Another classic FromSoftware masterfully crafted game. The only "negative" (and i use this term as lightly as i can) remark i have is that getting the 100% Badge was easier than many other FromSoftware games. Fun, beautiful, challenging. What can i say that hasn't been said millions of times?
Epic. Magnificent. Vast. Brutal. Haunting.
best game ever!!!

This is my 1st soul-like game and it was great. After 90 hours on my fiend shared account, I'm in love with this game and have to buy for my own account.
HELP
Awesome game!
yeah this shit cool fr
An Amazing Experience Throughout all of the Lands Between. Not too hard, but not to easy. The progression is a little tough, but thats the fun in it! You feel great for earning your levels, and it goes a long way. Overall, a fantastic game.

Still stuck in the tutorial hole

Every time you play there's something new to discover.
This game violates me...

...and i like it.

Lay those foolish ambitions to rest.
So immersive.  You tend to care a lot more about the world your in when every step could be your last.
very good very nice
Perfection, now we wait for the DLC
It's the best souls game ever.
It's a good game but it has it's flaws. Personally i like Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1 more than this.
But Overall i'd say its worth the price and time investment.
It makes me very angry all the time but I keep playing it
maybe maybe not
This is my first from software game and other than the first hour of gameplay (nonstop dying) this is the best game i've ever played.
Elden Ring is a triumph of fantasy and gameplay, blending FromSoftware's signature challenge with an expansive, breathtaking open world. Every corner of The Lands Between offers new mysteries and brutal encounters, making exploration thrilling and rewarding.

Combat is refined, strategic, and unforgiving, ensuring every battle feels essential and exhilarating. While technical issues like frame drops occasionally surface, they hardly diminish the game's monumental achievement.

With its gorgeous landscapes, haunting soundtrack, and deep lore, Elden Ring isn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs an adventure that reshapes the boundaries of action RPGs.

Verdict: A must-play for anyone craving a deep, challenging, and richly crafted world. Every step, every battle, every moment feels epic.
Absolute masterpiece 10/10
Mohg vs Drake when?
bomb game
If I had no job I would play this all the time.

I'm barely started but am loving it so far.  Highly suggest using a controller
The best game ever made. It ruins all other games by comparison. What am I supposed to play now?
BEST GAME 534 HOURS CURRENTLY PLAYED TIME
One of the games
ye
fun
not for me
PRAISE THE TARNISHED !
Great game, loads of content although the game does get a bit repetitive once you get towards the final areas. The diversity in enemies decreases as does the amount of new enemies.
some A-hole inflicted me with scarlet rot and poison, run away and left me to die
10/10 would rage quit again
nigg
fix ur game it freezes every 10 sec
you get to fight marge simpson, 10/10
Skill issue if u don't like the game
A nonsensical game filled with baffling design choices. From the sluggish and clunky combat to the unneeded open world, I have no idea how people are able to enjoy this.
Best game ever made, but 2nd best souls game behind DS3
In the Mausoleum straight up Mohging it. and by it I mean my Miquella
Good gaem
This game was worth $60.
10/10, a fantastic successor to dark souls
.
i'd give up my newborn child to play this for the first time again
its difficult to start but after you defeat Margit you are hooked and start grinding the shit out of it

nobody gonna read this anyways.......im straight
first of, Elden Ring
therefore time for something incredible
busted while playing, 10/10 game now i need to rethink my life decisions.
good game
noice
I'm not sure how to start, but here I go.

When the game came out, I downloaded the cracked version just to try it out on my old 3400G system. Didn't run well and looked ugly af with all the aliasing (trees and especially shadows looked really bad) so I deleted it. No, I do not blame the game; an old, antiquated iGPU can only do so much. Rather, I decided I'll play the game when I get a new PC.

Fast forward two years and now that I have a decent rig, I bought the game. I didn't even bother trying cracked again, because after all the memes, discussions, GOTY and hype surrounding it I knew it was going to be special. I was not wrong. Elden Ring is, and I [b] do not [/b] say this lightly, one of the best games I've ever played. I've played a decent number of games over the past two decades of my life, and it is easily in my top 10s. 

The story is excellent, but I'm afraid I can't say much without spoiling it. However, unlike most games it is not entirely spoon-fed to you through long, boring cut scenes. No, you're expected to peer into every single bit of lore scattered across the world and item descriptions and piece the rest of it together yourself. And after you're done, go to online forums and discussions to find out stuff you didn't even know was in the game. To me, this is the superior way to experience any narrative, where you're actively encouraged to research the greater lore yourself. Sounds tiring? Go watch a movie instead. 

Gameplay is simple, ironically, but the depth in mechanics across a very wide range of weapons and weapon customization per weapon makes it highly configurable. Every player thus has their own unique playstyle, on top of an already highly customizable character build. Bosses have frustratingly difficult movesets and often almost unfair advantages, but that is precisely what makes beating them so much more satisfying. Patience is key. Malenia is a very popular boss in the game, for all the right reasons, but there are so many more such memorable and hard bosses that most people don't hear about. Perhaps that's a good thing, so it remains a surprise for you. Besides that there are some puzzles, most not that difficult but some are so well hidden that you will be compelled to google after a while. And ofcourse, the age-old platforming. It's a lot more important in this game than you may realize; both for finding optional secrets and to solve puzzles. Admittedly I'm pretty good at platforming, so I haven't had that many accidental deaths, so your mileage may vary.....is what I'd normally say. What I mean to say is, if you don't like it, you're just bad at platforming. I'm not sorry. 

The audio design and music score are some of the best I've ever heard. Like a certain crack-induced YouTuber once said, normally music is not that important, but Elden Ring's is so good that it [i] becomes [/i] important. And that speaks volumes (okay I'll stop.) When out in the over world, you hear a subtle and eerie music that perfectly captures the atmosphere of a desolate, crumbling world in utter ruin. The battle themes on the other hand, especially during boss battles, make you feel like you're constantly in a David vs Goliath scene, which makes the pure feeling of euphoria when you've finally put them down all the more satisfying. The final battle theme in particular is legendary. They really outdid themselves with that one. 

The graphics isn't particularly jaw-dropping, but it isn't bad either. It is highly stylized, which particularly enhances the some of the most beautiful vistas I've ever seen in a video game. There are different places with their own unique, excellent architecture and thoughtful ruination to portray the state of decay and falling apart of the world, and the different environments having a unique color scheme was also a nice touch. The monster designs are what I'd call perfect depictions of Eldritch horrors.

Every little detail in the game oozes genuine effort, which I could never appreciate enough. Modern gaming sucks because most new games feel like soul-less (heh heh), lazy cash-grab experiences designed to pamper everyone and squeeze every last penny out of you first, and be fun and challenging to play second. Calling them "games" makes my skin crawl, so I made up a personal term for them - digital turd. Elden Ring is the exact opposite of a digital turd; it is a love letter to a forgotten era of gaming that used to be hard for the sake of presenting a challenge to the player, while simultaneously delivering a narrative, visual and auditory experience you will remember for decades, perhaps unto death. To the reader I may sound like I'm writing up a romantic thesis on a mere video game, but to me, it was just [i] that [/i] good. It absolutely deserves all the love I can give. 

Yes it is hard, as it should be, but also often not very clear about your next objective. I'd argue that is part of the game, because it encourages the player to explore and find their own path - that is the point of an open-world. There is no wrong way to play the game, you can clear most objectives at any time in no particular order. Admittedly, I had a friend help me out for the majority of the game, especially in guiding me on what to do next when I felt clueless. I don't have as much time to play games these days, so I was okay with a little guidance in place of doing my own due diligence. Regardless, I enjoyed every last moment of it. 

This goes into my "games worth playing at least once in life" list. Ironically, you do need to play the game at least 3 times if you want to get all achievements, but subsequent replays after the first get much easier so it's alright. And if I'm honest, I probably won't mind a replay or two of this masterpiece. 

It is more than just a video game, it is art. Can't wait for the DLC.
So good I bought it again after selling my Playstation. It's one of those games you can go without playing for a year and then suddenly get the urge to dive back in, only to somehow find you're having way more fun than you did the last time around.
Pretty Fun PagMan
Great game until Godskin duo then back to great game
I was skeptical to get this game at first even though I'm a Dark Souls veteran. I literally thought that it was some hyped up mainstream version of Dark Souls and stubbornly refused to get it since normies like it. With all that said, this game deserves all of the hype, praise, and love that people give it. My edgy opinion was wrong and I really have nothing bad to say about this game...EXCEPT the opening cinematic was a voiceover with pictures instead of a proper cutscene. They make up for it though with major bosses all having cutscenes. I'd say it's a hard game for normies, but I found it just challenging enough to enjoy.
Very good!
I am one of the very few who doesn't like the game, it seems. 
I don't like the controls (PC), I don't like you not being able to store your runes and losing all of them when venturing into difficult areas (don't like the "buy stuff and sell it later" either. Give me the option to safe them or don't), I don't like the ranged combat with the bow (it is clunky, the arrows cost too much in the beginning. You are not an archer, you are a melee fighter who can occasionally shoot arrows), I don't like the leveling system (seems bland to me) and I don't like how most of the stuff is not explained in the slightest. Some small text over some values wouldn't hurt. Nope, just Numbers going up.

Like I said: Probably not my game, had hoped it to be different. Will maybe try again after I cooled down a bit.
holy shit. i am the elden lord
Truly one of the best open world games ever.

Got nearly all the prizes it could and deserved
Check it out. I'm not asking.
When even a videogame mocks you for being maidenless.
10/10 would [spoiler] betray the Greater Will again to go on a space journey with my 4 armed doll waifu [/spoiler]
I'm not a big fan of writing reviews as English is not my first language but I'll do it anyways. This game is amazing, the world building, the lore, the bosses, everything here is beautifull.

If I had to score it, I'll give it 9.5/10 and only becuase I can't finish the game with an holy build.

If you are like me and not sure whether to buy it because a lot of people say this game is really dificult, and you don't want to spend money on something you won't finish, don't, I have 100% precent on this game and as far as I played I always (Ok Melenia is an exception) thought the game was fair, the devs give you enough ways to defeat whatever you are up against at the time and when you do you feel satisfied that you won.

 I'm a newbie playing on keyboard, I didn't even that good of wepons and I still did fine...

Overall, I think Elden Ring is a really good game that can let you escape from reality and have fun which is more then enough for me to call it a really good game.
Godskin duo is fucking annoying!?!?!!!

would recommend
Smash.
I will never understand this game developer or this genre of games. They just aren't fun. There is little to no story and you have no objectives our any idea what to do or where to go. The controls are slow and unresponsive. If you get into a group of enemies you're done because if they hit you you can't hit back, move or heal or anything. This game isn't fun or satisfying. This is the worst game I've ever played without a doubt.
so fking goodddddddd

This is absolutely the best game made. Yeah its super hard and gets frustrating at times but at the same time who does like a challenge!?
Do I recommend this game? Yes 100%
terrible game for beginners hard to defeat any boss ui could use better descriprions on how to do things. fun for people who've been into the souls games though
Not a game for the impatient.
amazing
Sekiro is better.
Elden ring? More like Elden QUEER
Yes
I hate this game so much.
Probably the most fun I've had in a video game for 30 hours so far. Looking forward to 100% this game
Genuine masterpiece, if you find thrill from beating seemingly impossible challenges, this game was made for you.
Amazing game. Elden Ring is a hauntingly beautiful game that is challenges players sanity. True to Dark Souls fashion it continues to provide excellent stories and experiences. Highly recommended.
10/10 would bear witness again.
Can't trust these maidens.
Great game! Challenging and a lot of flexibility in your builds. I originally did my first play through on Xbox and doing another on PC now before the DLC comes out. Highly recommend the game
I traveled the land far a wide only to learn ill always be a maidenless scrub sometimes its the destination and not the journey but this games both.
Dog
I want o kill myself :D
Great game, Im just too stupid to play it.
I do believe an average of $0.25 an hour (so far) of entertainment is good enough reason to give it a thumbs up
Good game
god i cant wait to play the dlc

yes.
munt
This game separates the boys from the men.
One of the best games
...
Elden Ring is beautiful, challenging, and massive to explore.
goated
please help this game has me in a eternal loop of playing i can't stop
When I started, I knew what the story wanted be to do, but didn't know how to play the game. 
56 hours in, I understand how to play the game, but have completely forgot what the story wants me to do. 
+1 for fantastic Steam Deck performance and Linux compatibility.
really hard game - can't get past main menu boss
7.8/10
Greatest game I've eveer played
JUMP AHEAD
Elden Ring was my first Souls-like game, and it was definitely a beautiful experience. From the highly detailed graphics to the amazing variety of weapons and bosses this game leaves you just wanting to stay playing all day, like I did a couple times haha. The ambience and great soundtrack just makes you feel more at home in this world full of monsters and enemies. I really enjoyed the dungeons that I would find by just exploring or being guided by the statues with the light, I also really liked that you could find some goodies like weapons or accessories in those dungeons. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and I'm really excited for the DLC coming out next month!
I played this for over 500 hours on console already, best game ever made
Its a good game but i think they should make a better story line to guide us, other then that its really cool 100% suggest it.
goat
I have played souls like games in the past, and Elden Ring is for sure my favorite.
Love this game so much. Recently, everything in my lifes gone t*ts up, and this thing is the only thing holding me together.
Great game i got 400 hours on console, getting new character for dlc!
big
very fun with mods and cheats (pls dont ban lmao)
Great game with lots of content!
supimpa
it's aigt
why not?
The best game humanity has made so far.

 I am thrilling to play the DLC.

See ya!
great game to cope with after your dad dies 10/10
I luv
Love this game, can't wait until the DLC comes out <3
Great game! Worth every cent.
If you're familiar with the souls games you know you cant go wrong with this one.
kinda mid tbh
chill game
Another Excellent addition to the souls series we know and love!
very good
Not Fromsoft's best game but also not their worst. I had a lot of fun with it and put in more hours than I did any of their other games so there's that.
90
good game period all ive got to say
its aigt
Best rpg game ive ever played, open world, perfect dificulty, and really fun, and im addicted, 10/10 best one since darksouls released for me
GET IT!!!!


9.5/10

Extremely replayable, infinite for some. Amazing open world, combat, exploration, bosses, world building, lore. Balanced difficulty, great for beginners, even better with friends, decent mods. Only downside is co-op, gotta install "Seamless Co-op" for the best experience.
good game

Banger Game
Still can't beat Margit
What hasnt been said about Elden Ring that other's have said in the last two years? Its in my top 5 of all time and will easily be in Top 15, maybe Top 10 Greatest Games of All Time.
Not fun
:)
is nice
Set's the standard high.
One of the best video games ever made. The armor sets are pretty ugly though.
Elden Ring is all about gameplay, the story is non-existent and that's okay because the journey you take is magnificent.

There are a lot of weapon types and play-styles to play from, the enemies feel fluid with their attacks.

I used to be bad at the game until I found out that the dodging and parrying system is based more on luck/stats, all you need to do is simply run way from the attacks and also use jump when needed.

I'm looking forward to the upcoming DLC
Best strategy rhythm game ever 10/10
Typical Japanese corpo nonsense.
"Liar ahead."
Amazing Game
no diff
game
one of the best games i ever played
So Much Stuff
this game is too good dont buy it because it will give you a crippling addiction to it seriously this game is a 20 out of 10 do not recomend
The game is difficult, as they say. But extremely rewarding, and you can play it with whatever build or play style suits you. Will most likely being doing a few play-throughs both to see what I missed and try other builds and strategies. Worth the money!
The game is very hard, but every time you beat a boss or enemy that was holding you back, you get this amazing rush that fills you with excitement for your next fight.
so far i think this game is the best game of all the other soulsborne titles but i still highly recommend playing the other titles aswell
I Recommend This Game If You Want To Test Your skill but If you get mad easily I wouldn't recommend this game at all
best game
super fun

Preemptive negative review for Shadow of the Erdtree. 
I cannot imagine what a $40 DLC could bring to this game to make me want to play it again but perhaps just  maybe the $60 Premium GRRM Hideo Miyazaki Edition DLC will be God's gift to mankind and save gamers worldwide from big Soy Woke Mind Virus Pronoun Burger I just can't wait FOR MORE SOULS BORN LIKE GAMING WOOOOOOO YESSSSSSSS
This has been my first Souls-like game, and it has been a very fun introduction to the genre. The game world is big and full of content. I also really like the art style and all its wacky monsters. I got the game on sale, but I would say it's worth the full price.
Good game? One of the best for sure. Worth the price? Debatable.
first off, rump
therefore... hump?
Good souls game for newcomers and bad souls game for veterans, I don't like it and finished only so none of my friends could say skill issue.
its fun but it also makes u mad, 5 stars
Made me elden my ring.
This game will not only be well designed and well written, it will also train your brain to overcome hardship.

FromSoftware is one of the last gaming companies that gives me hope for the future of gaming.
The combat mechanics from Dark Souls mixed with the open world of Breath of the Wild brings out the best FromSoftware has ever offered.
would kill the mohglester 100 times to get even a whiff of Ranni's sweat
SIR GIDEON OFNIR, THE ALL KNOWING
I've played video games for 20 years, and this is the first one that needed a second try to really get into it. There is a gap, and at first without ever having played a Soul game, I was the one being punished. But oh bois did things change when I came back and learned to overcome my own greediness. This game learned me a life lesson while being polished in the best aesthetic way possible. Bossfights become over time a bit repetitive, having to most of the time, wait to counter attack, but holy shit this game is fucking amazing. Best game of the century? I think so.
Quantity over quality.
dragons
One off the best Games 
Must Play ^^
girls are hot
Best game I have ever played

bread in french is pain, i turned into a baker after playing this
Absolute masterpiece

You died
Masterpiece
You can not go wrong with this game. If first time Souls player ... you're going to die a lot until you get the feel of the mechanics. Beautiful graphics and game play is soooo goooooood!
By far, it's the best game that was ever created in the history of games
Try elden ring
So to speak amazing game ahead
GOAT
10/10
The real game that can call itself OPEN WORLD RPG .
Try roll finger but whole!
Neugier -> Verzweiflung -> Lord
Absolutely stunning game! Can't get over how beautiful the landscape is! You can literally explore for hourssss. Love the bosses and I feel power flowing through my veins after every boss I take down. üòà If you're looking for a fun souls like game that will give you a challenge I highly recommend this one! 

Also, I should note-

:Visions of pickle: ü•í
This definitely become one of my all time favorite games. I came to this in the middle of  Dark souls 3. Finally completed that game continued with Elden ring kinda playing them at the same time. 

There was boss early on that almost drove me to quit but with such a great community i got help with the boss that was causing me so many problems. 

That is all said as if you run into a situation where you want to quit. Don't the community is amazing. If you legit need help and feel like you cant progress in the game, just ask in the forums. I've met some cool people that have offered to help and they have puilled through with ease.

The game is amazing, graphics top tier and the mechanics as usual are very in depth without being over complicated.

the lore of the game so good. however i only get the lore from online videos. the story with the from software games is in the items so thats expected. you dont play from software games to have naritive you play to conqure.

This is a game you do go into thinking oh this is a relax and chill. for some people like me it is. BUT its also a game where you must go into knowing you're gonna get annihilated, constantly. BUT when you achieve a section or boss the feeling of success is the best of any game ever made.

Just get the game. the devs are always the best. no live service crap, the dlc is worth every penny and you will always get your money's worth.
ranni feet
Decided to beat tree sentinel before moving on... finally did it!
No game has done this big of a scale this well. With enough build variety to keep you coming back and tough enough challenges to make that effort worth it
cant wait for dlc
Heat
Im in the last stretch, to someone starting the game for the first time.., get the bloodhounds fang
great game
very goood
lalalallalalala
Elden Ring is hard, but so am I.
180 hours on ps4, probably more with mods and allat
Dark Souls II was so good they made a second one
Liked the game. Loved when the kid says hi to Bill Clinton on Game Awards
Git gud or STICK YOUR SWORD WHERE THE SUN DON'T GET PRAISED
[h3]Let's start with the bad stuff:[/h3]
- Optimization is kinda poor
- 60fps cap, no DLSS/FSR, no fov slider (all solvable with mods)
- You need to install "seamless coop mod" for a coop experience that should have been in the vanilla game
- Story it's about getting bits here and there, no long cutscenes, in this department can't say I'm impressed, clearly the focus is the gameplay

[h3]The good parts:[/h3]
- The open world is great, lots of content, you can just lvl up around until you feel like you can defeat some specific monster. Easy to spend hours and hours exploring without realizing.
- The graphics and animations are great, not only that but the artstyle it's very diverse and beautiful
- Lots and lots of different enemies, all with their unique attack styles

[h3]TL:DR[/h3]
This is my first souls game, I knew it's gonna be challenging but it's a great game, punishing but rewarding
More fun with a friend in coop imo
Great to play on a gamepad
likely dog
Would recommend
worth
This is a good game.
BEST
‚ÄúHello soilder of elden, I am Melena the knight of ring and welcome to the lands between. I need your help come closer. The Elder‚Äôs Ring has been broken by the terrible Boulder demon and now we can‚Äôt die because the ring of death was removed, or so I‚Äôm told. Soilder, only you can rebuild the ring by collecting all 6 pieces‚Ä¶‚Äù. And so one of the most magical journeys of the gaming world begins. Buy this game. Just buy it now. Buy it.. I love the ring
IM NOT MAIDENLESS!!!
One of the greatest games to have been made by FromSoft, absolutely amazing and if you are struggling but still want to enjoy the game, there are many ways to make the game easier (Summons, co-op, strong weapons)
One of my all time favorites.  I hope the DLC is amazing and I hope there will be a second one in the future.
saw the leak for new weapon and stuff, im not paying for ds3 and sekiro moveset on elden ring new DLC. also its hard to enjoy easy game like this. might change it later, dunno
I am malenia, blade of miquella/10
Beautifully brutal. After a 175 hour play through with the Samurai, I've come back to play as the Astrologer. Feels like a completely different game. Still beautifully brutal though.
Good game
played this game for 100 hours i no longer have hair, nails, emotion, am at the Radagon boss fight
The best game money can buy, words can not describe how fun it is.
Awesome game, carried the flag too far.
it's all right
9.5/10 - Almost perfect
good game
definitely my favorite from fromsoft. cant wait for the dlc.
this is the best souls game ive ever played and you can do whatever you want and explore the world if you love open world and super challenging games get this game and also the DLC next month that i can't wait to play 10/10
What else is left to say? If you don't know the game yet, or haven't read a review, just play the game. Its one of the greatest video games ever created.
10/10 would die by angry drilling again.
Game of the year
I always treat this game as a open-world game with soulsborne elements. 
It has its ups and downs, but basically, the game is good. The flaws are... a lot. Experience them yourself, and don't forget to criticize it thoroughly. 
Also, you will understand how dumb the average Fromsoft fanboys are when you criticize their holy grail - Elden Ring. 

Recommended. Osusume. 

Emboldened by the flame of ambition üî•üî•üî•
yur
great game, get it

A game you simply must play.

I've made several attempts at the Souls-like genre, but unfortunately, I always struggled with it. I felt they were too difficult for me, and I didn't understand them. I couldn't grasp how people could praise a game where you constantly die without making any progress for hours on end. That is, until I played Elden Ring. It completely changed my perception of this genre.

After playing Elden Ring, you'll want to try more games of this type; you'll feel a sense of longing. The game has a fantastic atmosphere, breathtaking views, stunning graphics, and an intriguing story that you uncover yourself. As a player, you decide how to play and what to do; the world doesn't overwhelm you or force you to do anything you're not interested in. If you decide to purchase the game, you'll be enchanted by it.
Elden ring is my favourite game by far. Stunning visuals, memorable bosses, a beautiful and rich story, it's developed by FromSoftware.. What more could you want from an open world RPG game. For the love of god, please play this game!! 10/10 would defo recommend
difficult but satisfying
"Playing 'Elden Ring' has been amazing! The world is huge and beautiful, and there's so much to discover. The fighting is exciting, and I love how every battle feels different. It's not just a game; it's like going on a thrilling adventure that I never want to end."
best game in my book
good
Dark Souls for mages
still maidenless 10/10
yes
Great game, it removes my fear not only on souls games but also in life.
i love my horsey and my horsey loves me
literally one of the best RPG's of all time. maybe the best. and also the best in the Soulsborne series made by Fromsoft. like most people easily sink in 100 hours of enjoyment. can't say enough good things. the gameplay the visuals and animations and look & feel of the world are all top notch. for some might be too "hard" but its easier than most games in this series.
the game is awesome
No.
Elden Ring is arguably the best game in the series, delivering an expansive and fascinating open world that's a joy to explore. The landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful, truly some of the best visuals seen in gaming. Each area is packed with secrets and challenges that keep you engaged for hours. The bosses are a standout feature; they're brilliantly designed and offer a tough but fair challenge, although a few do repeat throughout the game. Devs really nailed the climactic feel with the last two bosses‚Äîboth feel like true final bosses and provide a satisfying end to an epic journey. I enjoyed Elden Ring so much that I couldn't stop until I had unlocked all the achievements. It's a masterpiece that's not to be missed.

VERY ADDICTIVE!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!
i hate this game a lot
I wish there were buttons on the face of the controller so I didn't have to grip both bumpers and triggers like I'm clutching a tray of food in prison. Also, it's Japanese.
try fingers. but hole

Its ELDEN RING... what more can i say

Ez game, addicting.
I used to get anxiety over work. After Elden Ring there's less anxiety because deadlines aren't as scary as a rune bear or revenants.

*Ring emote*
hard
Elden ring is a game that is an oddity to me due to the fact that on paper, it should have passed the next-gen test with flying colors.

I had a friend come over and look at the game, and he told me that the game in 8k resolution does look like a PS2 game. I don't even know why this resolution did this to this game as the game is usually highly regarded.

However, playing many other games from Bandai Namco, this seemed to be the only instance where their game did not pass. I think the suggestion is to just keep it at 4k, and build a new game with a mindset for 8k resolution once the game has reach the development stage.

Though I cannot recommend this game, it's still close to almost being 8k resolution.
im so bad at this game
I've purchased this game on multiple platforms and have played thousands of hours since its release....i think that says it all. :}
Emag taerg a si siht
game was good but expensive tbh
I don't like my sanity
goti
fucking shit
If you like Dungeons and Dragons and you would like a challenge this is the game for you.
It's pretty wild how seamlessly FROM has managed to translate their decade+ of Souls game evolution into a new open-world format. I've never had a "first playthrough experience" quite as magical as this one. I doubt you could even imagine the kinds of things you'll see in the Lands Between.
Probably one of my favorite games
I've come to find out this game is most fun when just getting lost. I recommend looking up some progression routes or missable items and quests videos to get everything or get platinum. Great picture and plenty og dialogue for the main story and for NPC's
amzeballs
will name my firstborn Radahn
DONT PLAY THIS GAME!!!!! BOTS ONLY PARRIED ME, EVERYTIME WANK GAME GGWP
I do not know how to use 99% of the weapons, but the more the weapon weighs, the more likely it is to be good (ruins greatsword, serpent hunter, mohgs sacred spear ect.)
A masterpiece in all aspects: visual, story, fighting mechanics. This is only my second souls-like game that I've played, the first being Dark Souls.
I've played this to 100% on three different platforms. It's incredible. In my humble opinion, it is FromSoftware's magnum opus. They might be able to outdo it in the future, but they certainly haven't produced something quite like this before (though Bloodborne comes close for me).

It's got plenty of aids to help you if you're struggling, but you can also make it extraordinarily difficult if that's the experience you're going for. The exploration is curated and while some locations and bosses are overly repeated, there's enough content for 4 games here, but it's all handcrafted.

10/10 game. One of the best titles of all time.
PLAY ELDEN RING!!!
its such a good game!!!
mid
Such an amazing game, 10/10, would recommend!

A game with amazing visuals and combat. Lived up to all the hype. Even though I have 141hrs on record, I have another 200 hrs when it originally came out on Playstation. Yes it can be challenging at times but that's part of the game. Liked the open world aspect of the game even though it can kind of be pointless after multiple playthroughs because you tend to know more or less where the things that you want are at that point. The characters and story/lore in my mind was really good, even though at times you kind of had to leave some things to the imagination, but I actually like that in some aspects, just cause it leaves options open especially for when the DLCs come out.

Talking about the DLC it's almost here and can't wait for it!

So.... Must play, 10/10.
Aisjd
maliketh is the bane of my existence
fun
They nailed meshing open world gameplay with the souls experience
amazing game, just a bit difficult to figure out because its open world.

I enjoyed the game. But from someone who has always been a fan of the souls series it just did not feel like a souls title to me.
Its like Skyrim but Darksouls. And actually good.
you died
shheeessh
This game is absolute peak quality and worth all of your time. It is well designed and very fun to play with friends. It's so cool and fun to explore and I think it was one of the best games I have ever purchased def worth your money.
It's like... so hard

AAAGH... RISE NOW, YE TARNISHED! YE DEAD, WHO YET LIVE!
Elden Ring Is The Greatest Game Of All Time. It's a world filled with Art, feelings, adventure, and indescribable experiences.
Great game. And it is also very big great game. Granted, it is achieved by repetition sometimes, but there is enough exploration and nuanced experiences besides that.

As it is a souls-like, my ratings on the garbage mechanics (the lower the better, on the scale 1..10).
Corpse-running: 4. 
Most bosses have revive point nearby, which still can be 50 meters away, but it is still closer then running from the grace. But most are not all, and there are pretty egregious examples of corpse-runs (like academia).
Losing consumables on death: 2.
You lose consumable if you die. But most consumables are pretty easy replenished by collecting resources, or are relatively cheap. There are some limited consumables, and arc, which are effectively limited in singleplayer. 
Parkour: 4
Game does have enough infamous DS parkour to it to be annoying, but most of it exists for additional exploration, and is not needed to end the game. Most content in the game consists of additional exploration, though.
Hitboxes: 3
There are some questionable hitboxes, but overall they are good.
Camera: 6
Somewhat expected of a game like this, there are time you fight the camera, not the boss. There are several places with bosses which do not really fit the room, leading to further problems with camera.
Fromsoft obsolete: N/A
Latest (at the date of this review) FromSoft game does not have mechanics, obsoleted by FromSoft.
Goated game, def play
Amazing peak gaming 100/100 absolute cinema
git gud casul
Best boss fighting game. Be careful, it is addictive.
This game truly is one of the best games I've ever played. The world design, hidden lore, and Combat is the best I've seen in the Souls genre.  100% worth full price. One of the greatest games of all time.

played many games but never played any game that could possibly be compared to elden ring, best game oat without a doubt
JESUS CHRIST 4 HOURS ON THE FIRST BOSS AND I HAVEN'T BEAT HIM IT'S SO ANNOYING I LOVE IT

edit: thank you for the clown üòÇ
I played this game already on the PS5, and I played it again from beginning to end on the Steam. I've put over 100hrs in the PS5 version, and PC has over 120hrs in. Most Games should take a HARD look at this game to figure their shit out. The game is very light on the story telling and uses the world to actually tell its story. instead of using hours and hours of insipid cut scenes just to explain the most basics of stuff. and every reward actually FEEL's like a reward! Unlike in games like FFXIV where the game just feels like you log in only to do nothing and still end up with a bloated inventory of utter trash. 

I legit can't wait till the DLC comes out.
You may die
sexy ahh game
10/10 Dog of the year
Ranni, O Ranni
thumbs up.
strongly recommend this game for players who haven't been involved in the souls-like genre but are looking for a start!

first of all gorgeous graphics, environmental storytelling, and atmosphere. easily could take a stroll in the game for fun provided things were not capable of nearly instantly killing me if i am not too careful.

second, the gameplay is satisfyingly difficult. many mechanics, although not explicitly told, are beginner friendly! you have many options for npc support or online support. additionally, there are few obstacles that cannot be conquered by getting the base mechanics down and simply leveling up. additionally, leveling up is not difficult.

finally, the amount of resources and community built around this game is simply wonderful! provided there are toxic opinions but you can play entirely solo but refer to well managed wikis for directions!

10/10 game!
very good game
Ranni. Need I say more.

i RIZZ GYATS
Best game to ever exist!!!
Might be the best soulsborne game of the bunch. Huge game and so much of it is good.
she elden on my ring till i shatter
Good
just completed my 7th play-through, still absolutely needed support from other players, but in my opinion that's the best part!
Best game of all time
It's a really fun and easy game after you farm runes for couple of hours and then use +10 Mimic Tear for most of the main boss encounters
Very good
Very good game if you don't like it guess you just gotta get gud.
this game is probably the reason why i dont have friends. but thyats fine. i dont need friends. im to busy playing elden ring
Ranni is mommy
benger game. I know tree sentinels moveset by hard
good soup
Yes
DA BEST
Busted my nuts playing this 10/10
Couldnt get past margit but i think the game is pretty good
best game oat
Best game ever made!!
Late game bosses actually ruin the whole game. I don't have enough time to dedicate hours to memorizing the moves on a two boss final fight where successfully completing the final boss is RNG. I will say, if you have nothing but time on your hands it's probably fine. And if you don't play video games to have fun it's also probably fine.
Great fantasy
I'm Jarl Ballin, ballin. Jarl Ballin. swag. Woman, I'm Elden Looord of the rings. I'm the 3rd elden lord of the Lands Between. Holla if you need me.
Awesome game as usual
Can't wait for the DLC
bonk
game good, weapon go bonk.
My playtime is enough to define my review.
Also pre-order the dlc
Boring world and slow motion battles. Play Nioh instead
Bloodborne PC please
i love the amount of toes in this game
very good ( violently violated by boss mobs for these past 3 hours) 10/10 would do it again
Best game I've played in 35 years of gaming
CANT LIVE WITHOUT SOULS GAME
Game of the year for a reason
I cannot stress enough, Elden Ring on paper is a really good game, and I love the closed, contained dungeons. Everything else kinda fucking blows. The open world adds basically nothing, crafting items is an irritating system that adds nothing but meaningless backtracking for even basic utility items, the difficulty feels like FromSoft is drinking their own koolaid, and the amount of copy pasted dungeons and caves... it just feels like a let down. Dark Souls has always been a series I enjoy, but Elden Ring is not what I'd recommend for anyone. The systems and combat are smooth, but it's just... not an enjoyable game to me. Cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone who wants an open world or souls-like games, as this is the game that ruined my enjoyment of them all.
Crap controls, never should have bought this console game.

[b]The Good[/b]
The game's beautiful, the world design is top notch. The fact that very early you can see places and landmarks that you'll be able to explore later on gives a sense of awe and adventure to the game. The combat is really good, with a lot of different common enemies, bosses and different mechanics.

[b]The Bad[/b]
Game's too long, a lot of dungeons that are exactly the same, a lot of enemies re-skins. Gets really boring if you're trying to complete everything.

[b]The Ugly[/b]
Most double bosses are poorly planned and annoying. The mechanic of weapons upgrades lock players with only trying a handful of weapons in a single playthrough. Why place some campfires or stakes of marika away from bosses, so players have to run through the same place a dozen times? That's poor game design.
This is the first RPG I've ever played that has replay value. I've played also of RPG's. Before playing Elden Ring my bench mark for the best RPG was The Witcher 3, now Elden Ring take the first spot.
This game is a beautifully stunning masterpiece and playing through it is a magical experience. 
Super excited for Shadow of the Erdtree.
This is my first souls-like game in a good few years, and the game is very fun. 

The combat can be hard and frustrating at some times but the reward from killing a hard enemy in the form of dopamine is really, really great. I would recommend it to people who want to up their skill in games, but also for the world building and lore. It's a fantastically crafted "Open-World". Each zone has it's very own unique atmosphere and the music is so good.
da game is gud
Nice
See turtle but message said it is a dog, amazing game.
First souls like I played and I'm hooked forever.
 100% on PS4, now 100% steam I'm ready for Shadow of the Erdtree
But in the meantime, let's try the famous dark souls
oh you dont have the right

THE BEST GAME!!!
very bad game dont play
This game isn't bad and I think its pretty good but it really wasn't worth my money in my opinion. Personal rating: 5/10. Actual rating: 8.5/10. I only hate this game because my bsf became all shitty because of elden ring and now he's gone gone, so if you have no friends (very likely) this game is GREAT for you!! YIPEE!
I never really played souls-like games before, but I decided to join the hype train and I am absolutely glad I did. The game is absolutely stunning. One of the best games I have ever played. Absolutely amazing graphics, open world that is just exceptional - all regions are breathtaking.
decent game ez plat trophy tho
Marika is trans and that is ok
THE BEST
great game

A must for souls fans
I swear i pressed dodge
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that stands tall as the ultimate evolution of FromSoftware's renowned Dark Souls series. The game seamlessly merges the rich lore, atmospheric world-building, and intricate combat mechanics that fans have come to adore, expanding them into a vast open-world that feels both fresh and familiar. The Lands Between is a breathtaking realm, filled with hidden mysteries, formidable foes, and awe-inspiring landscapes that beckon players to explore every corner.

The combat retains the tight, responsive feel that made Dark Souls so satisfying, while adding new layers of complexity with the introduction of horseback combat and magic systems that encourage experimentation. Elden Ring‚Äôs story, co-crafted with the brilliant mind of George R. R. Martin, brings a deeper narrative that is woven into every character and location, rewarding those who delve into its depths.

What truly sets Elden Ring apart is how it builds upon the legacy of Dark Souls, refining and expanding the best elements of its predecessors while pushing boundaries to create something wholly unique. It is not just a game; it is an experience that captures the essence of adventure, challenge, and discovery, inviting players into a world that will be remembered for years to come.
Onion Ring

This game MIGHT be the best game ever made
highly entertained game , amazing visual style and gameplay....should be tried by every1
Eldben Ring
Brilliant fucking game, but unfortunately you CANNOT sex the dung eater, so im very dissapointed >:(
I thought I was aging out of my desire to play videogames. Years ago this game made me love gaming again, so I feel compelled to write a review since I'm about to start a new playthrough.

This game was my first soulslike. The fact of it being open world was a draw to me so I decided to give it a try. Due to being in the process of moving and a few other things, I never actually finished it when it first came out years ago, but I still think about it. This game is the most fun I've had since RDR2, to this day. 

Remember when you were a kid and all you could think about was coming home from school to play that, in your mind, "perfect" game? It's all you could think about, time would go slow, and you just couldn't wait. It's a feeling we all, as adult gamers chase & try to find in games nowadays. Well, that's this game for me. This is the only game to give me that feeling as an adult. 

If you're new to soulslike games like I was, give it REAL chance, be open-minded, and embrace the difficulty you're likely not familiar with. It;s going to be tough and you're going to die a mega fuck ton, but it makes it all the more worth it in the end. It will be one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you'll have ever had.
very good and challenging game.
^-^
I shat myself twice from those bosses
game ez if you have brain and not follow dumb builds from online.
9.5/10 - Amazing and emmersive experience - beautiful gfx/world/designs overall, super fun combat and the progress through the game feels rewarding and worthwhile/needed to complete the game(at least as a new player to SOULS-games as a whole. The only reason i'm not giving this a 10/10 is imo, the lack of a need to replay they game. I started on a NG+ after completing it the first time, but around 10+ hours into it, I simply got "bored"/uncompelled to go on. The reason why, is still super hard for me to determine, as I e.g. have replayed a game like BG3 4 times, even tho that's also somewhat of a similar experience. A guess would be that classes etc. are fairly "similar" and simple in terms of the only thing u actually change, is main weapon(+enchants if using those) and your stats. Armors are partly just cosmetic but are ofc also changeable, for a slight bit of phyc or magic proctection. Theres nothing more complicated to it, whereas in BG3(tho very different games altogether) offer both a lot of narrative/story changes, as well as super complex characterbuilding, with multiclassing/gear combos/spell interactions+works interactions etc - all of it also set is beatiful sorrouncindgs as with Elden Ring. 

Regardless of everything mentioned above, Elden Ring is a gamechanger and 120% worthy of the excessive amounts of GOTY awards etc, it has recieved since release! I can't wait for the DLC to come out, to once again dive into that first-time exp of gettin destroyed, and destroy, new bosses with great combat and in magnificient settings. 
Thank you for this game, From Software!
/Hasufer
Let me Solo him. Need I say more?
A true masterpiece with very little in the way of issues to subtract from its greats. My main gripe was that 90% of the rewards i found/earned while exploring weren't relevant to my build, such as getting 100 different ash summons, 200 different spells and 50 niche talismans that i couldn't ever use (ran a strength build). Despite this, the world, world-building and boss fights were unforgettable - an 11/10 experience. There's only a few games that I've ever been as invested in.
It just üëå PERFECTO
Its fun most of the time
very nice!!!
I like it!
cool

just read any of the other positive reviews

Epic,game changing. 
forget skyrim.
great game have extra keyboards on standby though
9.5/10. Amazing replay ability, enjoyable experience throughout, very valid game.
I really hope the dlc blows my mind so far this game is the worst souls game. I really liked dark souls and blood borne but this game is just not as fun. After playing well over 100 hours i can say for certain this game is boring. I will not be getting the dlc until after i hear if it is amazing or not. So many fan boys crying about this game while circle jerking each other about it try something better
Oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect! Everything, down to the last, minute details.
Yeah its pretty good
Sounds: Sound good
Graphics: Graphic good
Fights: Fight good
Ambiance: ambiances good
Dialogue: Dialogues good
Overall: Good
its the definitionof suiiiiii
Praise the Elden Ring!
expect
Be wary of scarlet rot

This game is so goddamn good. Easy 9/10

I truly believe that most people will absolutely LOVE this game. My only real complaint is that although the game is fantastic, the optional co-op is fucking annoying as fuck. I'm fine with having to summon friends through the remedy's but the invaders are annoying as hell. In my entire time playing this game I have seen 3 types of invaders.

1. the one who just runs away or runs to an open world boss
2. The one that actually wants a fair fight
3. The one who has end game gear and one shots you

Can't I just play with my friends WITHOUT getting invaded? Is it honestly too much to ask for FromSoftware? You're telling me that you guys just COULDN'T make invaders in your game optional? well thats my only real issue with the game
insanely good
Incredible gameplay, beautiful graphics, and really interesting lore if you seek it out. Highly recommended.
sigma\

I finally beat that annoying old guy talking about ambitions on the bridge to Stormveil Castle, game doesn't seem that hard
horrible camera and controls .  game plays so poorly/  im  loosing my mind
Tip for new players: Talk to the guy on the horse near a church, he should give you a quest for a dope armor set.
in my opinion the best game ever made its the perfect RPG
punched myself in the peanits out of frustration, 10/10 melinas hot
Es a good gameüëç
its elden ring dude
This game is so good. If you like RPGs or D&D you'll definitely understand and enjoy this game.
10/10 deserved GOTY award. The most accessible game FromSoftware has ever made
Made me hate my life but overall a good game.
I really enjoy build crafting and the difficulty scaling.
perfect game
amazing game
combat and bosses are cool
map is massive and filled with things to do and items to find
the story is immersive
maidens

some of the quest sucks though
very good but will make you mad because the bosses are hard
I lke it‚Ä¶.
An absolute Masterpiece.
spider at the beginning >>> godrick
Good
Pro tip: watch out for soldier of Godrick he is the strongest boss in the game
this game will take years off your life. this game has kept be on the brink of breaking my PC for a month. Overall Game of the year.
ARISE, YE TARNISHED. YE DEAD WHO YET LIVE. SEEK THE ELDEN RING IN OUR HOME ACROSS THE FOG THE LANDS BETWEEN.
Seems end game in elden ring is miserable even with the heavy armour any mob can 2 shot u which effectively makes the armour useless and it becomes a dodge roll simulator which is kinda disappointing very few bosses are parryable and it kinda less skillful game play
Not to mention parry in this game is janky to begin with on top of that dieing to bosses in a matter of seconds if you didnt dodge roll really don't allow u to learn the boss fight do you
[7:20 PM]
Hot take: elden ring also follows the same open world formula as ubisoft games but its gets a pass cause its "dark souls" at the end of the day its just poi to poi in both games one game kills u a lot and make it frustrating 
I dont think dark souls should be a open world game i fought the same boss multiple times in my play through without me even trying which kinda getting boring real fast the race to open world kinda watered down the game quality as a whole

The lock on system in the game is straight up broken and disfunctional the messes up with you characters movement and the dodge roll which ends up getting you killed not a good feeling oh yeah there the enemies that can hit you through the wall and one shot you as well i have a clip of that and most bosses are too big and you can see or tell what they are doing and making melee build suck to play cause half the time u just miss ur attack 
not only miss ur attack it will put in a recovery animation when u use a heavy weapons by the time u recover the boss would already did a combo that melts ur hp 2 times over
the sheer boss damage is ridiculous even the the mobs can 2 shot u even with heaviest armour ,pretty sure i am better than 90 percent of the player base since i parried margit and loretta and the crucible duo fight before radhan after i completely gave up on parry since missing a single attack is a death sentence probaly use a damage reduction mod or summons to push through after that if u want a good time or u could just play the dodge roll game which is lame btw lol
be wary of amazing game
a masterpiece
no ultra wide support
ÊØîÁãºÈöæ
So amazing I played it on xbox and PC
WHO THE FUCK MADE THESE HORRIBLE CONTROLS ON KEYBOARD??!!! AND WHO THE HELL SAID AN 60FPS CAP IS A GREAT IDEA?!!!!
/
games dope
I am currently on my third play-through. 
I have lost everyone dear to me.
üëç
very good
you can suck d*ck from everyone and get one shottet from half guy half furry with big sword
You know that feeling when you've had water stuck in your ear for hours or even days, and then when it finally comes out you get that feeling of relief and satisfaction?

You get that feeling but for your entire body every single time you beat a boss.
very good game so far quite a slow burner at the start but then get really goods when you get into it
10/10 I recommend have like 12 days of play time on my Xbox. Very good must buy when you get the chance.
The male bodies are attractive, and the spells are cool - A+
w game
Great game.  Would recommend to anyone.
Dog
Become the Elden Lord
Masterpiece!
Fun game if you play with friends

Kill stuff, die, kill more stuff.

Recommended.
bad game
UI is really bad at least on PC, no possibility to change some keybinds, such as map. No feedback from enemies, roll forward doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs own bind, you cannot bind one key per item etc.
I need to get gud at fighting the games poor UX, yep, no thanks.
Da GOAT.
w game in the chat
GET THE GAME ITS SO GOOD IDC IF I DIE BILLION TIMES I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!
very good
mid
10/10
fun game dont break stuff like people do
imma just put it simple, its PERFECT!
Except being bad at fights I really like playing this dying simulator xD
Love the world building and the open world, you just need a VERY beefy computer
this is the dark souls of open world games
Just insane

Great game, much fun :)
nice
Elden Ring is better than Call of Duty: Vanguard
togethaaaa
"Marika's Tits! You must be hungry!"
gueno
SEX
Become the ELDER LORD !!!!!!!! this game is something else something you never experience it Love it
Maybe the real Rings were the Elden we made along the way.
good
nice game
Relly love the game! i love the costumization from the begin of the game a ton of costumization and reely cool clases i recomendit !
GOTY
B) yeah man
great
When the ring is elden
ms sellen can get it
The beautiful scenery and amazing characters distract me from the amount of ass-whooping's I've received.
Cmon, do I really need to explain?
yes
Good

Endless hours of beautiful scenery and challenging gameplay
GG
Guy called me "maidenless" 20 seconds in and I was hooked
This game is unplayable because there was no effort put in to make this game playable with keyboard and mouse. Bandai Namco is worth over twelve billion dollars, and this game has been out for over two years, how is this possible? The controls are just terrible.
I haven't completed this game yet but so far it has been a game that is very much enjoyable to play even if it may be a little hard at some points
its something
decent
Cannot sex the horse :(
May chaos take the world!

Elden ring is my top game of all time. It is definitely a game everyone should play and immerse themselves in the story, that you have to find on your own accord as it is not simply given to you.
Good platformer. I enjoyed the small combat sections.
'FOREFATHERS, ONE AND ALL BARE WITNESS' Quite possibly the coldest quote of all games topping it off with being in the best game ever created. This game helps me sleep at night giving a tingly feeling up and down my vertebrae each individual bone shivering with excitement knowing ill get to wake up and play this beauty of a game scrap God of War scrap Sekiro scrap any other game no game can top this. It has everything you could hope for in a game. The scenery the combat to dialogue everything is inch perfect really turning my frown upside down. The sheer amount of creativity this developer had is unfathomable absolutely ridiculous. Like honestly how do you come up with game which is enjoyable for everyone of every interest. this is and always will be the greatest game ever put out into the world. Honest review from Theo Christopher Mount nothing can and ever will be better than this game. 11/10.
yea its pretty cool ig

some people say its hard, but i beat witcher 3 on easy mode so it was pretty light
10/10 would recommend
simply amazing. i wish i could connect my old account

its just good

Death becomes your friend
combat 10/10

bullshit that isn't your fault killing you 99^99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10

STOP PUTTING PARKOUR IN YOUR GAMES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS TO FUCKING SUPPORT IT, FUCK YOU
Died many times just to [strike]unalive[/strike] one boss. 11/10
Great improvement from Dark Souls 3 when it comes to graphics, stability, and convenience. The bosses weren't as fun, but that's probably because the bosses are more intricate and are better at beating you. Balancing is a bit off, where if you spend a lot of time exploring, you get overpowered and every boss becomes easy. But that's fine since not everybody will do that. This is definitely the most accessible Souls game.

Invading is pretty hard though. DS3 skills don't transfer over well. Make sure to hit L2/LT more often.
Definitely try it!
A masterpiece, for me is easiest than darksouls, you have many possibilities, I usually learn and react slow to many games and some enemies take me 27 rounds to defeat them, no matter how stupid you are, here you will learn by force, I like this game cuz you usually entry to some dungeon in other games and is just hit/slash and usually doesn¬¥t remember the enemies and the map, but with this game will teach you to take care of everything, always staring each corner, always listening each door, always trying to protect your runes to level up, and the game is super big, price worthy.
I died and I liked it.
Good game 10 / 10
Its a brilliant game. A True Successor to the Souls Series.
masterpiece
Skill Based game, if you get mad dont buy
Nice.
good game
try elden, but ring
the game has the right balance of challange and fun
pretty good
it is a great game to play if you dont rage a lot do recoumedn and it has a long play time
very gut would recommend
goood
Beat it in around 45 hours total playtime on that character. Was good fun, open world allows for an easier time playing through the game due to more access to different items at different times. Decided to finally sit through it and play it before the DLC releases and had good fun.
Let's hope the DLC offers us many more fun times.
This game is a work of art, Everything just works for me. I enjoyed 3 playthroughs, a solo, one with standard coop, and one with seamless coop. Excited for the expansion.
I love godskin duo!!!!!
worst game ive ever played
skill issue fire game
I thought Elden ring was over hyped but I tried it and my god this game is truly amazing and very detailed and will leave you speechless, i have played 31hr just exploring the massive beautiful map
Didn't think the dark souls formula could get better. Then I played this game.
just amazing
Exceedingly frustrating: Fun

Basically everything.. :D
It spits fire
Great games !!!
Good
Game of the years. Just buy and fun
The masterpiece of masterpieces.
Souls but... Horse.
It's not openworld Dark Souls. It really is its own thing.

While not being my favorite Fromsoft game, Elden Ring is a masterpiece of worldbuilding, exploration, art direction and complexity. It's the most accessible fromsoftware input in the Soulslike genre, but it's also the most expansive. There is so much build possibilities, so much stuff hidden, so much craziness all around it's really hard not to find something you'll like, from its satisfying combat system to its lore, characters and exploration. 

However, one playthrough and a half later, I still think that the last third of the game is its weakest part. Nonetheless, it's a remarkable game deserving of your attention.
This game lets me punch things and customise my character. I like that in a game.
A solid 9/10. Definitely among the best I have played.
MASTERPIECE
elden god
good
First Souls game I've finished and it was incredible. Gonna be revisiting this game for years. Truly epic, with nearly endless replay value. The sense of exploration, wonder, and growth are top notch. An all-time favorite for me.
When I started playing this game I was a boy, this game taught me how to be a man
 Enjoyment-pilled and fun-maxxing
Elden Ring is a masterpiece. 
From the hauntingly beautiful atmosphere to the breathtaking graphics, every moment feels like stepping into a painting brought to life. Its vast, open world begs to be explored, each corner teeming with secrets and wonders. 
The bosses are epic battles of skill and strategy, each encounter providing a perfect balance of challenge and reward. 
After clearing all available content as of this review, Elden Ring stands tall as my favorite among all souls games, a testament to its unparalleled brilliance.
yes
great game, my personal from-soft game and easily the most polished. if you in any way like souls-like games or skyrim or god of war then i'm sure you'll love this game.
amazing

this ring kinda old
best game oat

I mean the game is alright, it's just a bit lacking content wise. Not really worth the 60¬£ get it on sale
Fun
don't let my played time on here fool you, on xbox I put 300 hours into this game within the first month of release. I barely slept. My dreams were filled with runes and maidens. This game dominated my life for 3 months, and even still draws me back in, like an addiction I just can't kick. 

Fromsoft outdid themselves with this game, and with the DLC coming out soon promising to be a massive new adventure, there is no better time to take up the charge of becoming the elden lord.
This is the best game i've ever played. Bravo!
Good game...USE CONTROLLER
mmm very good
mimic tear got me to 100%ing this game 10/10 game tho
great game, alot of hours to spend.
No f's were given when porting the controls to pc.
dnt 4get roll.. make invisible..
This is 100% my favorite game I've ever played. The challenge can seem unfair at times but after it was all over I realized it was the best experience I've ever had with any game ever.
Amazing all around, just that and nothing less. Can be challenging at times.
I am maidenless. And that's all I'll ever be
4/5
beat it on ps5, now i'm here
The best!
dogshit
from software games are terrible. for people with too much spare time.

Awesome boss fights
Foi um prazer me aventurar nessa obra suprema da industria dos games dos tempos modernos.

√â at√© estranho voltar a jogar os outros jogos da from software ap√≥s Elden ring, n√£o que eles sejam ruins ou datados, √© que esse jogo elevou a gameplay em nivel t√£o alto, que eu diria que Elden ring √© o souls definitivo - igual a ele, s√≥ ele mesmo.

yeah, i'd say it's pretty cool.
if her age ain on the clock she still 12 under my covers
its gud
Amazing 10/10 wish i could double dip my metaphorical taste buds in this game again for the first time. 
first time is always special and the second was a blast !

Absolute masterpiece. The worst mistake you could make is not try this game. The best open world, souls like, action rpg game I've ever played. If you enjoy a challenge, and enjoy playing games your way, then you should definitely give this game a go!
eleden riiinnnggggg wahahahahahhahhththth. fireeeeeeee fiiiirrrreeeeeee
try fingers, but hole!
:D
great
carry my friends in elden ring
I got banned for using a mod offline, when i came back online, they sayed i tampered with files. this game is a pile of trash

It's Elden ring



Wth do you want to say
dope
F E E T
pointless ahead, therefore try elden ring
Although I think DS3 still has the most well made bosses, and Sekiro the most refined game play, this game excels in pretty much all the same ways those games do and more. The sheer scale of the map, and the variety of weapons and builds you can create is immense. The world and lore is crafted meticulously, and exploring it is like no other.
Great game good game, no sony account required so good game lol lmao sony is huh?

Upon further investigation Mirazor was locked in an Evergaol to be tortured for all eternity for using a magic build.
isgood
honestly the storytelling is amazing and there is alot of options in your story plus its a good challenge if your weak minded and easily rage yeah dont play not for you
great game
Attempts a lot. Executes nothing. A lot of highs, A lot of lows. B - . Not Fromsoftware's magnum opus.
not as good as Dark Souls 1 but its alright
sucks
p
horrible game should never play
Im just waiting for the dlc
10/10
looks cool
good
It is an amazing experience with awesome difficulty! the story, characters, and gameplay all make this game an 11/10. Though, one thing... Its really hard. So if you like cozy fun games without much challenge, this game aint for you. Other than that, I 100% recommend this game to anyone and everyone!!
This game is so easy!
This is a good game BUT it's not optimized for PC at ALL. Controls are wonky, keybinds are not customizable, and the game crashes like a blind woman driving drunk at night on an icy road in a blizzard.  I generally hate games that are ports to PC, and while I certainly don't hate the game it's very frustrating and aggravating that controls and gameplay are so counter-intuitive...and that's not even commenting on the difficulty of the game, which is high by design.
awesome
G.O.A.T
top 5 games ever made
youve already heard by now. just stop reading reviews and download it.

Dark Souls 2 2
It is the modern fromsoft experience, rebalanced and expanded into a new and open world experience. Great gameplay, great fashion, great magic, great multiplayer!
I fw ranni
torrent is so very soft
If you're a fan of the souls games you'll love Elden Ring. Huge map countless locations to explore, beautiful map design too. Amazing game
Elden Ring is Elden Ring.
The world of The Lands Between is vast and filled with challenges, but it's also a place where connections are forged and courage is found. This is not a game to just go and speed-run all the way. This game is meant to enjoy every small steps and to look for every single details and hidden adventures here and there. I am glad I deep-dived and went for the 100% trophies.
This isn't just an adventure; it's a testament to the power of perseverance. A true Wonder in Modern Gaming. And as the credits rolled, I realized : I might not get to play something as extraordinary in gaming for a long time in the future now. The world of Elden Ring grabs you, holds you tight and makes you wonder. I don't know how will Fromsoft reach the height of this game again with another IP. I just know, I won't get to enjoy something as remarkable as this in gaming, possibly for a long long time.

10/10, Flawless.
something something but hole
dying is fun
fun esp with mods and friends

***OFFICIAL STEAKHOUSE REVIEW***
Long time Souls Lover,
this game is the greatest love note from From soft.
this is basically a massive Souls game with boss after boss after boss.
with friends or solo this game offers so much, well worth the price.
my friends and i often say if they would have charged double we would pay it.

Highly recommend, don't miss this game you will regret it.
E
After playing for a while I finally touched grass. It is worth buying especially if you're a fan of souls-like games, not to mention the upcoming DLC expansion which I'm expecting to have juicy new content especially the new boss which for sure will pound these "foolish ambitions" out of me again. 

It is also not that heavy demanding on graphics for those of you wondering, don't believe what the internet says. My PC is not that good but hey it works for me!
I CAST FIREBALL
Overrated
233 hrs playing, still don't know what to do. Few glitches, an unbalanced / unpredictable AI,  sometimes to easy, somewtimes too difficult enemies, even the same ones, good landscapes, plenty of weapons, a very entertaining game, sometimes a very boring game, very frustrating not knowing what are you looking for open world game, lack of journal, huge map
very great but you have to know what setup you are going for

Only time ill be held by a woman
Best game this century. One of the only games I wholeheartedly recommend to buy even at full price
awsome game period!
Best of the Best. I love it >_<
They keep punching me in the dick!
Best game ever. Just wanted to give my thumbs up
The difficulty is really off putting to a lot of people, and so is the aimlessness that you feel at the start. There are no questlines to follow, and no exact direction to go to, to progress. But please just push through it. You won't understand anything for the first 10 hours but once you get a hang of the mechanics and controls, you'll really start enjoying it and its so incredibly rewarding. If you feel like you're stuck on a boss, leave it, and try the next day. Don't know what to do? Just run around trying to find caves or dungeons or bosses. Trust me, its a fantastic game. Give it a chance
Makika's tits
took me 150 hours for godrick excited to see how the rest of the game is
cant pet the dogs
i like hard games so yh also good combat and beautiful world
Amazing! Just Amazing

this game is very good 

Das is Good Yah

play this if ur planing on killing yourself makes you acc go through with it
this game is just amazing and dlc is on the way!!
Amazing Game. Its been a long while sense i had a game that gave me a sense of wonder.
Elden Ring is the epic masterpiece we‚Äôve all been waiting for! It combines the dark atmosphere of Dark Souls, the intricate world of Bloodborne, and the epic combat of Sekiro. Praise the Sun! üåûüó°Ô∏èüåï

Second fave FS game., One of my all time faves.
I've beat this game on 6 characters. That should speak for itself.
john elden ring
I climaxed a few dozen times playing this game
BEST GAME EVER
dont play if you care for your sanity,greate game
3¬≤/10
Elden Ring is my first soulslike game and it presented great challenges right from the beginning. For someone like me, who was new to this genre, Elden Ring initially felt like a huge effort with little enjoyment in the actual gameplay. However, as time went on, and I improved, the fun factor continually increased. The beauty of the game world, the music, the boss fights, the lore behind it, and so much more, make me confidently say that it is probably one of the best games released in recent years, and I am eagerly looking forward to play the new DLC!
Simply put, it's a masterpiece from gameplay to the environment, music, everything about it is fantastic!
fun game
just brilliant
very good
Great game but gets really frustrating towards the end. Bosses like Mohg and Malenia had me questioning my entire life.
i want to fuck the moon bitch
132 hours in this world and I still have no fucking clue whats going on or how the hell I'm supposed to finger some hole
Roundtable Knight Vyke
P.S. Fire Giant
Very nice R E L A X game
You can team up with a furry and 4 armed woman üëç
Great exploration,lore,presentation,environments,level design almost everything,besides more than half of the bosses. Unfortunately... Still a 9/10 in my eyes.
best game of all time <3
yes
First time playing a game like this. Was certainly a challenge, but so much fun. Can't wait for the DLC to come out.
recommend
u should buy this game NOW!
After beating [b] Malenia [/b] I felt confident enough to beat my dad.
Fantastic game. Playing Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne years ago, this FromSoftware has perfected the formula, producing a series entry worthy of the top spot. I'm very excited to see this game through.
10\10
one of the best souls game, should give it a try even if this is your first souls like title
Firstly, so far, the hype is completely warranted.

However, if you run an ultrawide monitor and this is important to you, I do not recommend the game. Big black vertical bars will dominate the screen. I understand the "competitive advantage" UW supposedly gives but I play single player and wish I had known about this limitation and poor choice of implementation before purchasing, so am leaving this review to advise others. 

Even some appropriate game artwork in place of the bars would be an easy but acceptable fix.
it's ok
um dos melhores jogos que j√° joguei, considerando que joguei mts jogos AAA, mas tamb√©m o mais dificil sem duvidas. jogue com tempo.

i need that scarlet rotussy

anyways feet
Git Gud
need more scythes ngl
ELDEN(BO)RING
God tier game 10/10. Bought on steam even after already having it on PlayStation. Worth every penny.
Super fun and engaging, could not put the game down from start to finish. Can't recommend enough!
GET GUD

The idea of open world and no quest marker help. No complaints here.
Greatest game of all time.
Im not a soulsborne expert but this game is amazing and it shows that with progression and determination, you can conquer this game!
nice rot
the bitches love boys who play elden ring 10/10 would try agaim
good
What can be said about one of the greatest video games ever made?

It's hard as hell, rewarding as hell, and you'll get lost in the world for days on end.
They did a lot of things right. The creators really did an amazing job with he world building and atmosphere. The weapons are interesting and diverse. Some of the characters were likely, though maybe not as much as ds1 or ds3. My issue was the boss fights. Honestly this is completely my opinion, and maybe I should just get good, but I have a 120+ hours in this game, and perhaps twice that in other games, but every boss felt a little bs. The game made me so pissed I nearly screamed at the top of my lungs at 11 at night while the house was asleep. Every boss had this delayed attack mechanic that throws you off. After the first time its just a skill issue, but after the fourth time, it just gets annoying. The bs bosses that stuck out to me were Radagon (whatever his name is), Melania(of course), and Magma Wrym. Honestly Magma Wyrm wasnt that bad, I just needed to adjust, but Radagon had some stupid hit boxes and final phase was just keep away. 

Melania's heal is annoying but not game breaking, but her flurry of blades makes me want to kill myself. You'll be doing good, second phase, then she pulls it out of her ass, and there is nothing you can do, hope you're at full health with a vigor of 50. She also can just stun lock you so you cant dodge. I'm aware she is designed to be hard, but it feels more unfair than difficult. I'm playing at 146, 45 vigor, 20 endurance, and maxed weapon + max lv mimic and she still bends me over. In short, games a buy, if you like a challenge and cool scenery.
Gwynevere's fat tits, and fat tits in general, are absent from this game.
They missed the perfect opportunity too.


Please Miyazaki, rectify this, and also let us wear the deathbed companion panties without getting banned. 


[spoiler]sellen is best girl, for this game at least[/spoiler]
this game makes me want to throw that ass in a triangle
Would play again
A really good game recommend 100%
beST
You might want to keep a web browser tab for the Elden Ring wiki open at all times. Game is great modded or not.
gg
Awesome - 10/10
The world is absolutely beautiful, and exploring every inch of it never got tiresome. Though the bosses aren't perfect, through all the rage one must realize you must get good to enjoy the game to its fullest. 10/10
Good game just dont get mad
This Miquella guy seems like he has his whole life ahead of him. I sure hope nothing bad happens to him
Not fun
10/10
melina and ranni bad
good game enough said

Fantastic game with a huge world to explore
Just expect a ton of B.S. and maybe you'll have a good time.
Try finger butt hole
Masterpiece.
im like: bro chill
Excellent, except those gargoyles, I hate them.
gaming
A bit tricky if i do say so myself
 All I wanna say is I've been a Dark Souls fan since I was about 10 and I've loved all of y'all's games since! Elden Ring is a challenging and strategic game with a lot to do for new players and even old/daily players. Overall a beautiful game with a bad ass art style, combat style, story, and so much more! Everyone I know is getting ready for that DLC! WHOOP WHOOP!
Imagine, you break your toe, then you break another because you broke another then another till all toes are broke then break all your fingers and you start crying well this is nothing like this, it's more pain. congrats, you've played Elden Ring bring on the DLC
goated

Beyond the poor optimization, reskinned enemies, trippy dialogues with NPCs, frustrating dragon battles for a melee user and the anger inducing input mapping, Elden Ring is a beautiful game which makes me wanna "git gud". Every boss I beat feels rewarding after the amount of tries it takes. I believe I am not even midway through the game but the secret to finish / enjoy this game is to never give up. 
The lore is enchanting if you carefully pay attention to the dialogues. 
I absolutely love the open world feature but maybe giving some outline of the main quests and side quests just to see the progression and if I am missing something would have been really helpful instead of trying to figure out hints from dialogues. 
There's a lot of negatives but I would recommend this game. If you are a masochist then this game is definitely for you.
best soul game !!

This is the most boring game to ever exist.
amazing game

I am still bad at this game. Love it, 110/10. (not a typo)
Fuck holy damage, but otherwise 10/10 game
One of THE best games ever made.
good
nice
fun
the game of all time

peak
Honestly, the game speaks for itself, just play it.
all hail grass

You know that thing that kids call "hypetrain", or whatever? Where they scream to high heavens how OMIGOSH HOLYSHITATATATAAT THIS IS THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED ("and I have played nothing but shit!")!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111

That? Yeah. This time it's actually true. All the hype. All the advertisement. All the promises. It's all actually true. It's like I'm 10 again, and video-games are actually fun again. Fun to play, fun to explore, fun to get lost in from evening till sunrise.

In a time when big budget side of the industry and even much of indie scene has been flushed down the toilet long ago it's nothing short of amazing how something like this exists. Play this game.
Such a fun game, i loved every boss every bit and its hard but in a challenging way, if you do everything right its pretty easy
try finger but hole!
Marvelous!
It has Mohg. It is PEAK
good
bro its awesome game its fromsoft
this is literally the best game i've ever played. 10/10

I like trees, and this game.... this game has the best trees. If you like trees you will love this game friend.
Absolutely incredible game. That is all.
It's an amazing game, no doubt, but I am an adult with responsibilities and it's fucking dumb and very inconvenient that I can't pause the game even when I play single player offline. Important phone call I gotta take. I guess I'll just die. My kid is about to do something stupid in the kitchen. Guess I'll have to restart this entire section. Boss I've spent the last half hour trying to beat is finally almost dead, but my wife needs help with something. Fuck me.

It's retarded when I have to use mods as a workaround for terrible game design and mods have a tendency to break when the game updates. Let me play offline without having to use mods and give me a goddamn pause button then I will change my review. Thanks
Very easy
For me this is the best open world game I have ever played. It took what was great about Skyrim (if you can see it you can go there, create your own story and play through it the way you want) and amps it up x10. The art style, vistas, world design, level design are on another level. It really is a dark fantasy world come true.

 Another thing I like is they give you the tools to make this game work whatever way you want it to. If you want to play online and get that experience, you can, or just go offline and avoid the hints....and the invaders (which is the way I like to play by the way). You can touch all the sites of grace and never have to backtrack too much or don't touch them. You can summon spirit ashes to help your fights, or....not and make the fights more challenging. Plus the choice between all the different melee and magic styles. And Torrent is an amazing addition and a must for the way they designed the game!

  I just like the flexibility of getting to play the game the way YOU want to. I think it's great that it opens up FROM's style of game to people who didn't not normally play their games and hopefully will enable FROM to make even more epic games in the future.  

I am probably 3/4 of the way through the game because I search every nook and cranny of every area to find all the items because I like to collect all the gear. As far as the world and it's design and the epic vistas everywhere you look with all the secrets I have had more "wow" moments than any other game I have played. This game rewards you for spending the time to search every nook and cranny of it's world.
GOTY BTW
"It's rpg where you're playing the role of a professional victim."
this game sucks but so cool, i will play it more
good
It's good
good game
If you don't already know you should play this, congrats on waking up from your coma.
hardcore game very fun, although you can play with other players only in dungeons and bosses, it would be better if we could play alongside a buddy everywere.
You will suffer...
Played it with a friend using seamless coop 10/10

In my humble opinion this is probably one of the best RPG's ever made. It's totally worth trying, just make sure you do a blind playthrough before following any guides. You'll never recapture that first playthrough experience.
Dark Souls 2 2
After 150+ hours on XB1, I now play it smoothly on Steam Deck. 

+ challenging and rewarding tactical combat: a soulslike power fantasy 
+ awesome replay value with amazing build options 
+ fun and reliable multiplayer (PVE and PVP) 
+ memorable boss fights and areas
+ cryptic lore set in a gorgeous vibrant world 
+ strong sense of discovery while exploring
+ solid music, sound and visual design
+ smooth transitions between open world and soulslike levels
+ many quality of life improvements to the soulslike formula
+ playful mockery of the player and community
‚Äì an open world with too many cheap boss copies and filler areas 
‚Äì wish it wasn't an open world at all
+ best open world game I've ever played

This game is incredible.
good
Firstly, let me start off by saying, this game is as challenging as you want it to be. If you are a newer player, you can go about your first run with OP summons (essentially companions) and or OP weapons. This generally melts bosses quite quickly. Not to say that they are no longer challenging at all, but the things previously mentioned are definitely a lifesaver, that's for sure. If you feel that the game is too easy, go back and fight the bosses without summons, or over powered weapons. It feels good to beat a boss with those things, but there's something special about besting a boss with just pure instinct alone. Again, the game can be tailored to your liking and preferences. I recommend the interactive wiki map of Elden Ring if you get stuck, or are searching for specific items or bosses. Or just look it up on YouTube. Good luck!
Game is quite easy, i like it, wish bosses were harder though.

Seriously one of the best fantasy rpgs on the market. The difficulty keeps you coming back for more and the boss fights make you feel like the protagonist. you start off as a pleb and slowly push to a point where you can casually slay deities. One of the best games of ALL TIME imho.
easy game, now i have a hole in my table.
I platinumed this game on Playstation, and I fully plan on doing it again on Steam. A game like this only comes around every once in a while.
MIYAZAKI COOKED LITERALLY SOOO PEAKK
IT IS OK
ye  gud game
best game
Just play the game okay, it's good.
Malenia easy
The game runs poorly, with stuttering and dropped frames being very common. The only way to fix this is to disable the anti-cheat and play in offline mode. But then, you miss out on multiplayer and player messages, both of which are a large part of the experience. The game will also crash regularly. Gameplay wise, the default Fov is 35 which is almost unplayable. The only way to fix this is to install mods which can't be used online. Also 90% of the armor and weapons are just plain ugly. If you want to look like a badass knight like you did in Dark Souls then you are out of luck. Also very few weapons have unique movesets, for example almost all 21 greatswords have one of two movesets. This game lacks the polish and attention to detail the previous games had. You're much better off playing those games than playing this one, Dark Souls 3 in particular
Amazing
i like it

FOUL TARNISHED
From Software has time and time again made some of the greatest games of all time. From the original Demon Souls on the PS3 to Armored Core. 

Elden Ring is the best game From Software has ever made, which is quite the achievement
this game is what sex is like
hmm game good yes dog turtle
This is the best single player game I have ever played. From the exploration, boss battles, and story. I wish I could experience this game for the first time again.
nice
i love
this is the best game ever, i am a huge fanboy. this game makes me want to bite my wife.
Ranni
Probably one of the funnest games once you learn the mechanics. You can beat this game whatever way you see fit. Learn it and you'll love it.
Can't wait for the dlc
not dark souls 3. its not as good
One of the best games I've ever played
after 500 hours i can confidently say:

get good
It's difficult in the beginning but gets easier and I like making big progress in games. This game honestly makes me really happy and its a game to chill if im not havin a good day.
a game like elden ring comes around once in a generation - relish it
serotonin machine
Probably the best souls game ever made. absolute 10/10
horror game of the year
You can be a femboy. What more do you need?
its good

Finally, a 10/10 game (imo)
Super fun, but super hard. prepare to die A LOT... its so fun tho.
Praise the Elden Ring !
and then,
Seek pickle.
Great game but it has a small learning curb.
game is good
open world good story building and you can kinda move at your own paces if you want w game fr

Best game ever made
Blasphemous Blade!
5/5 Stars.
It is rare for a game to meet it's high expectations. It is another thing entirely to be better than anyone imagined possible. Elden Ring proves FromSoftware's mastery over creating the feeling of overcoming challenge. It allows one to express their own creativity in playing the game in so many ways, yet the system mechanics are so strong and refined that everyone in every scenario can succeed. It builds a dark fantasy world of gods and misery, knowing it has provided you, the player, with all the tools to overcome and succeed in this miserable world, whiles simultaneous allowing that success to be dictated and tailored to the way you prefer to express it.
Was fun until the difficulty got ridiculous, normally I am all for difficulty playing rain world, dead cells, AC6 but this is just a waste of potential. I know how fromsoft operates and their reasoning but this is just way to far, I mean only 20% of the people who bought the game could even beat it and they probably used meta and cheese. If that's what you need to be able to play a game then consider at least adding a difficulty slider or something. I expected to be a major challenge and to spend several hours on each boss but this is just sad.
Very fun and open world
I killed a guy who threw blood fire and now the maiden person says she wants to kill me
Masterpice.
This game is like a good vagina, hard to get but when you do there's nothing better.
funny elden ring go brrrrrr
Very good game if you like to grind a storyline.
I would give this a negative review but so many feet
From's worst game.
yes
My oh my where do i begin! Great story! Great graphics! Great Game-play! Would Recommend!
Great Game few flaws Hours of fun
Fort, night
Piss man was harder than mommy of Miquella :(
ughmmmph
If you have a friend I recommend get the seamless co-op mod. Beating a boss you have been stuck on is infinitly more satisfying when you have someone else to celebrate it with
I watched one of my close friends in Discord as they were live, and each time they played, it got much more interesting the further they got into the game. It's not just the fight of killing in the gaming or other achievements, but it also shows how interesting each boss is and how VERY WELL detailed the game is. I would absolutely recommend getting this game. Also, what I find astonishing is that you can not only play by yourself but you are allowed to play with friends and go on a journey together throughout the game. The only thing I would NOT recommend, if you DO NOT like scary things, DO NOT get it. :) However, you might end up liking it. We may never know. :D
worst soulsborne i've played
good game
I really hope we can see Ranni oiled up and twerking in the dlc. 10/10 would smash all day long.          :3
very good game
Awesome atmosphere, music, and visuals. Easily the best souls game to date.
fun
500 + hours,  still only NG+1 and discovering so much new shit
A culmination of From Software's greatest aspects from previous games, while also being open world? Yes, a thousand times yes.
Has the actual worst camera angles ever. Worse than the original resident evil 4.
Greatest of all Games.
good
mommy let me put my head on her lap 10/10
i've been beat up so many times and i keep coming back for more, i feel like that's my kink now...
modern classic
What if instead of the frenzied flame it was called the freaky flame and instead of burning the Erdtree to the ground and incinerating all that divides you just sucked Radagon's toes.
Ranni is hot
everytime i go out every single fucking monster whispers dirty things in my ear but its so worth it trust
adwdawdsadaw
Masterpiece
Awesome game. Nobody does it like fromsoft.
its a good game
very good gamings
Legendary
i hate / enjoy playing this game
peak

8.5/10
 Waiting for Shadow of the Edgetree so i can become chosen beta
In my 40 years of gaming Elden Ring easily sits in my top 5, maybe top 3 favorite games ever, period.
Second playthrough never felt like the first one,
but somehow it's still felt like a masterpiece.

masterpiece
best game ive ever played

This game is going to make your life hell but in a good way :)

Extremely overrated.
This game is amazing fr!
wish ranni had 4 Feet
Get it. Right now. I've been playing video games since I was 6. This is one of 3 games that get a 10/10 rating from me.

Dung Eater got me intrigued
onde √© o boss?
Literally the best
this game turned all my friends into femboys, im the last straight person left in my friendgroup
You're maiden less? sucks to be you bro me and ranni got married sooooo...
Amazing game.
Never had so much fun dying at a game.
Epic game just epic.
big sword
.
good
Honestly one of the best games Fromsoft has made. Imo coulf use a bit of a texure update
unus duo tres quattuor quinque super-electric-xperience
Worst game i've ever played
one of the best games ever developed!
aids retards play this game
Dark Souls on steroids.
Something special awaits you
Just an amazing game that's it.
Extremely good game if you enjoy having your teeth kicked in, it has a strange ability to suck you in and not let you stop playing, or maybe I'm just a masochist, anyways, you should play the game. If you are looking at this review it is quite likely you already have the game though, make sure to praise the sun, wait, wrong game, go forth and become Elden Lord (Togethaaa)
fena
im trash but its still fun
Malenia makes me want to rip my brain out of my ears, other than that, 10/10
Ranni. That's all.
Yes, it's that good.
never touch random blood stains youll be traumatised from the brutality 
(im starting to see shadow figures)
bad game
This game has a wide range of weapons and areas to play, making it extremely enjoyable. 

The graphics were very good quality and a lot of uniqueness in the weapon and enemy designs.

PvP still remains unbalanced however~
I Could Never Betray Her
got hug by a woman for a first time 10/10
pretty good game, but when i go in it is super laggy and i have very little fps.
holy moly
best gaming experience
me want play game, game play me instead, but me came out on top, me winner, me happy, me recommend
Super fun, Lore hits so hard. Gameplay is fr perfect 11/10
great fighting challenging but rewarding
MY BALLS ARE SWEATY
I have gotten every single item in the game using only one new game cycle and I still love it. can't wait till the dlc drops (already preordered)
wow
This game plays good but I feel like it desperately needed enemy and monster variety. Seeing the same 5-10 reused soldier and monster enemies all over the map seriously ruins the feeling of adventure. Every single required boss is designed basically the same, as well. There is no variation in boss mechanics, only the moves that they use.

7/10.
simplesmente da pra pular e tem cavalo, bao demais
good game is good
if you're struggling, just use mimic tear
Excellent game. Not as difficult as you might think.
Its cool
amazing
Fromsoft doing fromsoft things. 10/10 Ranni the goat, L frenzy flame
very good game
MASTAPIECE
Bink me up Bink me down this game is goated
elden rimg
One day i will finish this game but for now i will continue my adventure! sometime, soonish, probably, maybe after sand land, idk i want to play threw resident evil 1, 2, 3, then elden ring, unless someth'n else comes up tho the DLC is soon too so that might take priority XD but i havent finished the game yet, i do love this game dont get me wrong, i am just enjoy'n take'n my time threw it :D
GAME IS FUCKIONG TERRIBLE WHO WOULD PLAYU THIS
This was my first Dark Souls game that got me truly hooked in the genre. I'm obsessed with this game. I don't feel discouraged like other souls games and I get to play at my own pace. I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the Dark Souls games
easy game
bad
Fun
yes
duh
Beat it to NG+3 on PS5 and then double dipped on PC to replay with ray tracing.

Elden Ring requires patience or skill. Easy mode is achieved by taking your time to explore every nook and cranny, leveling as you go. Hard mode, rushing through the game and taking on difficult bosses at low level. Both are there, but you either have to want a challenge or enjoy patiently picking apart the beautiful world piece by piece - which ultimately will lead to more skillful playing anyway. Dying is part of the adventure and really, if you collect your runes before dying again then there isn't even any punishment. Enjoy the risk, challenge, and adventure. If it's your first souls game there are always build guides. 

It's not a game that will hold your hand and gently walk you step by step and I love it for that.
very good game a masterpiece imo
game fun
Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds Kill all birds
Praise the death!
sexy
One of the Souls games ever!
blasphemous blade funny
easy 9.5/10
Great vanilla,  a blast with seamless coop mod and convergence for endless replay-ability
bad margit doesnt work
fromsoft SUCKS theres so many technical issues w this game its not even playable anymore wont launch after almost 20 hours of perfectly fine gameplay what a fknn joke
this ring old as hell
Near perfect game, only bad thing is that the scale of models like trees are too small, and the fact that its empty (lore explanation I know), witcher 3 and rdr2 done it better.
Good game
My first soulslike, the start was rough like i expected but after a while i got the hang of it and enjoyed it, some bosses made me lose my mind, but other than that, i loved every second of it, truly an amazing game. I Highly recommend it.

P.S. She is Malenia, Blade of Miquella

sigma game
I loved it when Vike said "It's Elden Ringing time." an proceeded to make children with a dragon. Good times.
banger
"Still no horse."- If you like Dark Souls series, you'll L.O.V.E. this~!
400+ hours in and still finding new stuff. Equipment, armor, locations. The game is rather difficult. Just pay attention look for weakness among enemies.
Changed 3 controllers on my first playthrough. 10/10 will be playing again.
A masterpiece. Lore, graphics, gameplay, there isn't a thing that this work does not satisfy.
goood
I would sell my future offspring for a chance at playing a future sequel if it ever comes out, this is a masterpiece, hoping for Dark Souls II 2 II to come out one day.
you will cry
Fun, Hard, A little annoying but other wise a really fun time.
New Player Friendly :)
Praise the sun!
stay far far far away from this game if you value your sanity & personal hygiene
Fun game. Replayability is limited, but it gives you like 100 hours for 2-4 run throughs
Dog
no
just buy it
GOOD

Good game
the best
indescribable
I was starting to get into Berserk and i saw that the greatsword was in this game and i was like i can kill apostles LIKE GUTS WITH THE BIG ASS SWORD so Thank you sincerly you know who for getting me this I loved this<3 Confusing in the benin if u havent played a soul game but gets easier troughout if ur bonking everyone with the greatsword 10/10
if you don't like grinding i don't recommend it but otherwise its great.
It's the most stressful and the most joyful game at the same time.
git gud...
Best game love everything about it.
8/10
good
10/10
From a new player perspective (new to souls-like games):

Well done and interesting world overshadowed by bad explanation of ingame mechanics and where to go, full of frustrating stressfull BS that is only there to waste your time. Its absolutely not beginner friendly in any way. Your getting run over by everything while fighting with the fumbling controls, changing stances, using different buffs and replenish your mana only to be fight ready, mid fight..

- f cheap ambushes and getting range attacked on "jumping puzzles" or ledges
- f delayed attacks
- f no grace period after entering a boss arena and getting instantly jumped by the boss
- f getting hit from outside the arena
- f running 30sec+ back to boss arenas
- f the lock-on system (especially on multi target fights)
- f losing all your progress while beeing bombarded with all above

I cant understand, why ppl love this game. After 19h played, i am left with a headache and broken controller. Now i have to buy a new one to continue.
Worst souls, that I played. Dead open world, and a lot of copy-paste. I love souls, I played 96 hours trying to understand that game, but just cant. 4 crystalians copy-pastes out of 10
10/10
can't wait for the DLC <3
how do i dodge
onion ring
mindblowing
it games for sure
i beat the game 4 times and never got the elden ring???
.
Try finger but hole
Game is amazing
Could this be Dog?
best.

New player to the Souls or Software games: I love this game, 10/10. 

Some Pros: 

Love the challenges that this game throws at me. Some bosses/enemies felt impossible, until you actually get good at the game. I heard a lot of people complaining about the toxic souls community, but their not toxic if their telling the truth right? If you can't beat any enemy in the game with your build, you are in fact bad and need to spend more time on the enemies. That's the fun part about any souls games, certain enemies feel impossible until you learn their attacks, then it becomes easier.

Love exploring the world and trying to find interesting items or embrace the gorgeous landscapes. I like finding hidden bosses, defeating them, and getting cool drops. I love learning how to fight all the different enemies that this game throws at me while I'm exploring.

Some annoyances:

Some of the larger enemies can just clip through walls when performing their attacks. This happens in a smaller arena and it makes it really hard for me to accurately dodge their attacks. Torrent can be really hard to manage and takes a lot of practice to some what control. Some attack combos feel impossible to dodge and I feel like you can't dodge or jump to avoid either close or instant death. I'm not 100% sure if some attacks are never to be "avoided", but I feel like that's not really the case. I would like if someone can confirm if some attacks are non dodge able. If so, I feel like that's not souls like. I would think every attack is dodge able if your good at the game. Not a big fan of the lock on mechanic due to me focusing on the enemy I'm fighting to be all of sudden targeting some random animal or another enemy that I didn't want to focus on. Most of these annoying points are just that, their annoying, but I can live with them.    

To be honest, I can't wait to finish my current "wizard" play through and do some type of melee focused character. I haven't seen most of the combat moves since my character focuses on range attacks. Can't wait to learn how to dodge new attack sets.
I died a few times (more than a few)
GOOD
Great game LOL. Play it to find out
Just amazing game. period
Masterpiece. You can play it solo or TOGETHAAA
My third time beating this game, a masterpiece through and through.
Elden Bling
good game
This game is extremely hard and not new player friendly. You will have to do your research on it but once you do and are fully committed it will be one of the most rewarding game you will play.
Very nice game
this game is just too fun
Strong Game of the Decade candidate! ^^
Good game alot better than Dark Souls 3(bad game) and Bloodborne(no one cares about this, it was a one off, and it sucked), but it is still not as good as Dark Souls 2.
It's awesome. Like, a really really good game. You can experience such a quality gaming experience with this one. We can go on for hours about how good this game is, but I am sure there I'd just be hashing things already said. I will keep short what I don't like:

1.) It does not work on ultra-wide screens without disabling achievements and mods. Wish it came built in, but FromSoftware just adds these black bars in. Something about fairness in PvP, whatever. Not a thing I like. (21:9 aspect ratio)

2.) There will be a point where it can drag along too long. I don't mind reused assets in large games, it makes sense. But there's a line and it's danced on with a little too much familiar enemies and maps (catacombs, mines). There's certainly enough new stuff along the way don't get me wrong. But the amount of times I was blown away at how large the map is got old when I was ready to end the game at the 100 hour mark lol.

Still really worth the experience. Can't wait for the expansion.
Liked everything 
Disliked nothing
Never had so much fun sucking at a game. [spoiler]Oh wait.[/spoiler]
worst game i have ever played the mechanics are horrible the character does not  do what you want it to half the time the bosses are OP to hell they can kill you through walls the game makers have got rid off all the exploits  a player can do but left the bosses untouched this is ridiculous and then they want to charge you another 50 pound for a DLC where the game is still broken. its about time game makers where held responsible for making broken games and charging its customers some times over 50 pound for a game that does not perform  as it should  DONT BUY THIS PEACE OF CRAP they should be paying us to play it.
not hard enough
Too much build variety i have to play 10+ newgame with new build everytime
Best game
I came in maidenless. I tried to build a maiden harem. I ended up madenless. Inconsistent platforming mechanics. I simped, I cried. I died.
No maidens?
best game duh

[h1][b]A Masterpiece Forged in the Flames of Ambitions[/b][/h1]


[b]FromSoftware has once again proven themselves as true artisans of the gaming world, and Elden Ring stands tall as their magnum opus. Every facet of this game is meticulously crafted, from the sprawling landscapes that beckon exploration to the intricate lore that weaves through every corner of the world.[/b]

One of the most striking aspects of Elden Ring is its sense of scale. The vast open world is a testament to the developers' ambition, offering countless secrets to uncover and challenges to overcome. Whether you're traversing the towering peaks of the Lands Between or delving into the depths of ancient ruins, there's always something new and exciting to discover.

But it's not just the world itself that captivates; it's the stories woven into its fabric. Elden Ring is a game that rewards curiosity, encouraging players to delve deeper into its lore and unravel the mysteries that lie hidden beneath the surface. Every NPC has a tale to tell, every item holds a piece of history, and piecing together the fragments of the past is as rewarding as it is engrossing.

[h3]Elden Ring is more than just a game[/h3] it's an experience. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, the beauty of exploration, and the joy of discovery. So if you're looking for a game that will challenge you, inspire you, and leave you breathless with wonder, look no further than Elden Ring. It's a journey you won't soon forget.
Very great game. Some areas can be challenging but every player can still progress given a little gumption. The possibilities of play style are fantastic, you can do literally anything you want for just about every aspect of this game.
Putting aside the nostalgia of older titles, Elden Ring is objectively the best game I've ever played, hands down! If you dislike this game, then you are the issue.

Its aight
hell yea 

I thought this game was hard LOL (iv played it 8 times)
Having no maidens has never felt better than this.
GOATed
funny
This game requires extraordinary amounts of patience. You gotta be patient with yourself whilst getting used to the way the game plays, and with the game itself. Also, get used to dying a lot. The sooner you do, the less frustrating it'll be for the next time.
Top 3 of the best games of all time for me, i love every aspect of the game i love the summons and the online is ok, if i had to complain about anything at all it would be that the online is really weird, they have mods where u can bring someone into ur game forever which imo is how the online should of worked for this game, instead of being based purely around each and every fight and then disconecting. I love the new dlc coming cant wait to play it, ive put prob 500 hours into this game, i know my time might say different but it only counts the time im connected to wifi, would highly recomend its by far the best game from this publisher and gave me hundreds of hours of time, dont give up just power level ur character find out how to train levels it is hard at first but if u want to u can over level ur character by just killing enemies and getting xp,
it is just so good!
game make me angy but so fun yes v v fun

This game has made my top three list! I doubt it will ever fall off.

If you enjoy the endless opportunity of open-world buildcrafting this game offers, you'll love it. I tend to prefer linear games with more curation of experience, and this was no exception. I really never felt on-par for the difficulty. If you haven't yet, go play Sekiro. All in all, lovely experience despite the difficulty gripes.
low play time, but goty so must be good.
Exploration feels great.
It looks gorgeous.
Expect delay on the attacks if you come from ds.

Me kill God. Me love
Kill the NPC 10/10
I keep dying
beautiful scenery, challenging gameplay
I absolutely love games like this that seem like they will take hours and hours to beat. And this one really did take me hours. An incredible game i would recommend anyone play.
lit
Just a great all around game
its a masterpiece and worth the price
good

this game is too easy
much gud. if it not gud then it is sign to git gud

Big Swords make Big Swoosh sounds smacks enemies into pancake, I'm excited for the DLC to smash
game of the year for a reason. some of the most interesting lore and great storylines for the npc quests. beautiful and huge settings that vary greatly (when i started i thought limgrave was all there was to the map). if you find yourself struggling on mouse and keyboard, give controller a try (the first 9 hours i made no progress on mouse and keyboard and dropped the game, came back on controller and 100% the game)
The dogs are really nice! 20/10 would pet again.
i used to have this ranni doll that i used to pour milk on and suck the milk back out of and it was sopping wet all the time üò≠i used to slam it against walls and it would make a loud thud
One of the best games ive ever played
claws go stab! ha ha Ha!

 Souls-game
Can't run the game properly.
Stutters when using a usb hub or a kvm switch. Locks fps to 60 on a 144Hz monitor. The third-party FPS unlocker solves the frame issue but not the stuttering. Unintuitive and unresponsive UI (clearly no fucks given as far as PC experience goes). I wish I could love this game, but I don't think I'll ever be able to.
Elben Rang
This is the best game of all time
I FUCKING HATE RADAGON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IM GOING TO COMMIT ENEMY FELLED TO MYSELF
FromSoft delivered again. I prefer the previous, non open world titles however it was still a fun experience. I can't wait to reinstall this game once the DLC drops in a month!!!
The Game (If you have watched the SouthPark episode "Tale of ScrottieMcBoogerBalls") its just like the tale its really difficult(Replaced From Gross) and for me the most difficult game I have ever played in my whole life that isn't a platformer but its really good And I would totally suggest it to anyone who likes a challenge.
got gud
Good game.

its ok tbf
SO GOOD
enjoyable 

WTF
Great story, great gameplay, great music, great designs.

Great game.

Beautiful artwork, great, memorable boss fights and intricately designed legacy dungeons.
The game being open world actually didn't do much for me. I think I prefer the linear experience of the former FromSoftware games. Still enjoyed this immensely!
One of the best games I have ever played!
First soulsborne, and it is now my favorite game!
Dodge
I have 200 hours plus offline and as a my first soulslike game i can say that i would 10/10 recommend this game. do not listen to anyone saying you have to play the game a certain way just be like me and use int and one million guides on how to get the best loot. this game is honestly a gemstone and i cannot believe the amount of time put into it you can truly feel the world and the love that the creators put in from the lore to the amazing gameplay designs that  make you feel like a god! my only problem is that there isnt more to do once you beat the game... if only it had like an online version or smth that could make it easier to do quests and expolartion with friends {a mod exists for this for free}
Truly a journey of a life time and well deserving of the title "game of the year".
A solid 10/10
didnt like it too hard
248 hours of getting my foolish ambitions put to rest
straight jorkin it
I is fun

First time playing souls game and loved it !
Pretty good.
It got its flaws (mainly some boss designs) but overall a very good game.
30+ hrs and im already in love. Incredibly open, inclusive, full of risks& fun. Give me pain& joy the same time lol
Very nice.

just beat margit but i'm having fun!
i lost my runes...
how tf you mess up the ember system, it was perfect in DS3. you gain more max health and heal to full using ember but risk being invaded and it gave you suspense because it could happen at any time being invaded.

in elden ring if you invade its going to be a 1v2 or 1v3 or 1v4 never a 1v1 and if you want to be invaded you have to use an item that does nothing for you but you get instantly invaded so there's no suspense or risk or reward or nothing close to what DS3 embers gave

all that being said obviously the game is goated but bring back the greatness of pvp with embers otherwise its just a pve boss simulator with some exploring and thats cool but the world feels dead without authentic invasions

and nobody cares about duels for 1v1, i dont even mind 1vX but sometimes i just wanna invade a mf and grief them for my entertainment

Make sure you talk to the NPC in golden armor on his big horse at the beginning

Good game
Haven't played this game for to long, but I would highly recommend it, yes, it is pretty hard, but that's part of the fun, learning to overcome everything and getting better slowly but surely!
Marika's t1ts, you must be ungry
I think this is my new favorite game. I was obsessed with the idea of playing it for months and now that Ive got it and finally have beaten all the remembrance bosses I feel Ive gotta give it that Thumbs up review it deserves. This game is for fans of breath of the wild who want it really hard. And I mean really hard. I may have died 1000 times, about an embarrassing 150 deaths to the hardest boss and about 600 to Soldier of Godrick. Buy it. Elden Ring ahead.
I hate this game (10/10).
Nice.

Finished this on PS5 (>100 hours). Controller was a lot better than KB + M, so I'd recommend getting one to play this game on PC. One of the best games I've ever played. Very challenging, bit of a learning curve, but once you get over it extremely immersive and fun.
I have over 500 extra hours on Console and coming from the nearing 800 hours of this game I have played I think this game is one of my favourite games of all time, there are quite a few places where the game comes up short compared to Dark Souls 3 in my opinion but i don't want to make too in depth of a review but most of all want to say, if you have ever wanted to delve into the world of the souls games there is no better game than Elden Ring for that, this game can be much easier with the use of certain mechanics and much harder without, this in a way tweaks the difficulty making the game far more accessible for newer players.
i love this
if you use RoB seek mental help
hate this game, i hate when i die 100 times to the same boss. i wouldn't recommend this hell like experience to my worst enemies.
10/10 would play again
Try Elden Ring o' Elden Ring

this is a good game
When in doubt, try finger butt hole
it aight
Punched my desk at Godrick and broke my hand, my pinky finger knuckle is forever fucked. 10/10
It is a very competitive/difficult game for people who cant find a game to cure bored-em this is the one
goat
A piece of art
ELDEN RING: Where your worst enemy isn‚Äôt the bosses, but your own addiction to exploring every nook and cranny. It‚Äôs like Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild had a baby, and it‚Äôs a beautiful, chaotic mess of epic battles and getting lost in the woods. 10/10, would forget to eat dinner again.
Masterpiece
I could not even begin to describe how much this game made me cheer with triumph, scream with rage, stare in stunned silence, gasp in horror, grieve in despair, and more. . . This game is more to me than just another flawed FromSoftware masterpiece. It's quite possibly my most personal, and cherished Action Adventure Fantasy game I've EVER played in my life. Zelda was long dethroned by Dark Souls for me years ago, but this... THIS GAME has SO MANY uncanny coincidental personal overlaps with my life in allegorical form it gives me moments of sheer deja vu induced uncanny pause after pause. 

I don't know if anyone out there in the world has ever experienced anything so synchronous. . . 

I made a prophetess for my first character, and I pursued the flame of frenzy incantations because HOW the FUCK could I have passed up apocalyptic power fueled by the sheer madness and trauma of the collective suffering of not only myself but countless others?! AHHHHHHHH...MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD! I thought... but then... I uncovered more things about this terribly tragically fucked up world... I discovered the duality of Marika/Radagon... I discovered Malenia and Millicent, I discovered Miquella... and their wretched state at the hands of Mohg... I realized VERY quickly I didn't want to burn it all away... that for the first time in FromSoftware history...that I could REALLY see myself in this game! Then Elphael... and the sheer pain and sadness of those losses... No... I cannot, and will not EVER burn all this away... no matter how painful it is to remember I will NEVER forget them... those who have came before, but are no longer with us... I WILL REMEMBER AS LONG AS I AM NOT HOLLOW! Also, there was nothing more epic in my life as who and what I am... and having so much of the world turn against you and people like you...only to discover that in this game one of the end bosses is like us too...but violently suppressing its fluid nature?! How fucking perfect that Radagon would be Marika, but obeying the oppressive greater will in the end... How perfect for someone like me that a Miracle Caster would be suppressing it's own female half violently... I had tried to do that... for far too long... Their self hate for their own red hair that I used to hate... that I would one day reclaim proudly and defiantly...

 I only wish I could have shown you these games in person when you were alive...but you're dead...and have been for a long time... no one remembers you but me...and I have no proof you ever even lived...but I know you did...I love you...and I miss you...forever.


Probably the worst game I ever played in my luife
play it im begging you
A true masterpiece. Very unique level/world design which rewards your curiousity, everywhere you go youll find new loot or enemies so it keeps you interested. Even after over 400h ingame it feels like I¬¥ve barely scratched on the surface.
Monumental souls-like RPG and best open world game of all time.
great game but rageful
gg
My pc is trash for this game 1650 i5 10400f my pc and I play with low I got drop frames i want a help
its good
THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

i wished i never started playing this game

UPDATE, THIS GAME STILL SUCKS. Suicide is still an option at this point
Fantastic game. Loved it so much I got it again for PC
godly game
Its perfection
I wonder, what are Shabiri Grapes? Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... What sight they must behold.
must try


good
when do the rings elden?
Masterpiece. I've never seen an open world game this detailed and full of content. The combat and game atmosphere are outstanding. It is a good game for those who are unfamiliar with the souls-like genre because it is not a very difficult game. There are many things to praise in the game, But here I will mention the missing parts of the game:
1-Story presentation is bad. It has a good story, but they didn't present the story well.
2-There is no quest log. It might seem as if NPCs don't give you quests, but in fact, they do provide quests and quest rewards. It's almost too difficult to complete NPC quests without using Google and Youtube. FromSoftware should pay attention to this now
couldn't get past the main menu other then that im guessing its a decent game
10/10 game 
fromsoft don't add trio godskin please
Dark Souls agarrando todo lo bueno de Zelda Breath Of The WIld
crack in game form. good stuff
Dark Sous :)
Hands down one of the greatest games ever, i played it at launch on xbox, but got it on pc for mods.  Despite the fact i beat it several times on console i clocked in almost 100 (at the moment) and I will continue to spend more time on all the souls games.
PUT THESE FOOLISH AMBITIONS TO REST
I played this game through 15 times over on PS4, I got on PC so I could play the DLC. This is the best soulsborne to start with if you're new. I highly recommend.
im gay for fire giant
I‚Äôve spent a week straight playing this game myself to prepare for the DLC. Let me just say that this game is INCREDIBLE! I will admit, this is my first souls experience but don‚Äôt downplay my experience cause of that. I assure you in ripping and tearing my way through the later dungeons but besides that. This game, beautiful. The soundtrack, incredible. The bosses, memorable except‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect weak foe.‚Äù Elden Ring GENUINELY is such a huge world that feels vast. I had several points throughout the game thinking the game was so much smaller and then suddenly the map just expands outwards and as if on a silver platter From Soft smiles and says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for the main course.‚Äù This game truly tests your reaction time as you‚Äôre ducking and weaving through attacks, taunting your foes into attacking your shield so you can perform a follow-up strike! Combat oh my god it‚Äôs so fluent from all the gadgets and bombs you can craft to arrows, bolts, and knives there‚Äôs just SO MUCH in this game! Did I mention there‚Äôs a whole HUGE DLC coming?! Trust me dear person reading my review. I assure you this will be one of the most memorable sixty dollars you will ever spend.
10/10 Masterpiece of a game. I was held in the arms of a woman.
She Eldened on my Ring until I was Maidenless.
Game is skibidi
Like DS2, but world just isn't as pretty.
pretty good, first part of the game can be trash to play but after it gets pretty fun
yes
dog water 
A game priced at $60-$80, worthy of being priced $60-$80. If you are interested in Souls games, I'd recommend it.
Though I wasn't and I loved it, so maybe you will too!

My first playthrough where I didn't complete everything and skipped a few areas took me 150 hours. And the entire time doing so was spent in wonder at the shear amount of interesting things there are to see/do/defeat/etc. It didn't feel like a chore like Fallout and D2 do sometimes, everything was worth my time doing.
I'm currently on my second playthrough on a completely different class and it plays almost completely different.
The style
The music
The world
The characters
The voice acting
The views
The weapons
I could go on and on about why this game deserves your time, before the DLC that adds around a 6th more things to experience, just try it yourself!

Also Fromsoft, please Remaster / Port Bloodborne to PC :)
A crown is warranted with strength. Greatest game ever made, 10/10.
hugged a woman, then she killed a man and vanished, I'm complete.
Played over 120 hours on the PS5 and back at it on the PC and still finding new things that i missed the first few runs, cant wait for the DLC!!!
its fun

best game i ever played. Got it as a gift from my friend.
This game is amazing.  If you like the Souls games you'll love this.
I have a true love/hate relationship with Elden Ring. It's by far the most beautiful game I've ever played. I love the open world. As a PC gamer and used to MMO's like EQ where you basically  hit 'attack' and sit back, the combat learning curve for me was and still is difficult. I play on a keyboard but I feel like the game was designed to be played with a controller. Nearly all the video tutorials on YouTube give you the controller options when describing how to combat certain bosses or enemies. I've made it about 3/4 of the way through the game on multiple characters from pure magic user to tank to hybrid tank/incantation. I get to a point where the boss fights are just beyond my ability. My only chance is to out level the encounter by farming runes and watching cheese videos ad nauseam, and hope I get lucky. No matter how strong you are, many bosses can still one shot you. I get infuriated when I die because I'm stuck in an animation sequence and can't react. With all that being said I still enjoy the game immensely and will continue to play it, and recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful but challenging game.
makes me weanna die
I played it. It's good, played it some more, still good. About to play it again...
pray & roll
Elden ring is one of the most outstanding games i have ever played. Not just the amazing adventure and exploration to this game. All the Hard but amazing bosses you get to fight. every boss you defeat gives you such a addictive feeling of joy. I highly Recommend this game if you like souls like games, but if you also like a little challenge in your life
dak souls
i love elden ring its the best game ever marry me elden ring daddy
choot, BANG BANG sword
best game ever made fight me
Every thing is great about it

Hoarah Loux came into my house and suplexed me
This has become my favorite game of all time. I have walked away with so many epic memories.
Best Game ever!
This game is very fun. i would recommend this game due to how fun it is.
game good
baddie alert
really fun game. better to suffer with friends though
git gud
still havent beaten the first boss btw
guess i just suck an unimaginable amount of dick

fun
blaidd best girl
Literally my favorite game of all time. Polished mechanics, incredible visuals, beautiful soundtrack, insane replayability, rich story, challenging at time, and overall just incredibly captivating. I have never invested as much of myself as I did into a game until Elden Ring. I am thrilled for the DLC this upcoming summer and await the many more hours of fun it will have to offer.

Buy this game right now, you will not regret it.
Just parry him lmao
good game i think maybe
Just good
i cant use vulgarity so just no
kinda easy but fun
it's so good that my girlfriend is willing to play it
why wont the story progress ffs, but good game
Game just doesn't end!
Is an absolute banger! 
10/10 would die again!
fun
BEST GAME EVER!!!!! CANT WAIT FOR DLC
poo
I realize that this game has been out for 28 months at this point, but this game is truly a masterpiece. The art-style, the combat, the boss fights, the side-quests, the music. As an avid From Software fan, I truly believe this is their best work. It deserved the game of the year award, and I can't wait for Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.
Elden Ring is extremely addictive. Can't wait for the DLC.
Very good.
Best game ever
My Favorite game of all time. Dying is part of the game, don't whine about it and just get good.
So fun
Everything.
This game reaaaally made me question my sanity at some points, especially at the Fire Giant and Malenia, and quite a few of my deaths didn't feel deserved at times, but i still play because of how good the game is. 9/10
Skill gapped
Great game
Still in Fia's arms. Will be for the next 1,000 hours.
I think she is Malenia, blade of Miquella.
Greatest video game I've ever played. Made me feel like a kid playing great games for the first time again.
While if you are a fan of games other FromSoft games you may enjoy this. As someone who came from Sekiro i struggle to recommend this game. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way to get upgrades. This causes me to get stuck on bosses that i do barely any damage to. If you enjoy other FromSoft games this game might be for you but if you prefer the linearity of games like Sekiro I think twice before getting this game.
long term game >? >> elden ring is a right choise
sooooo recomended for u that love the epic story line... this game its so mind blowing
and dont forget to join the community cause that so help full to solve any problem and disscuse about the game üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
yeaa im not finishing this game
<3
w game
100h+ save game got corrupted because the game crashed while saving... Could not do anything about.
From all Darksouls games this had alot of issues with graphics and crashes (me and my friends).
The gameplay is great (like all souls games). The PvE balance is way more off because of the open world feature. I do not like open world. I don't want to see the copy paste assets all over again and again. The dungeon and castle layout are great though.

Why does FromSoft have backup savefiles which they overwrite immediately with the corrputed save game?
savagery
dog ahead
THIS SHIT SLAPS
Absolutely fabulous.
elden ring
The Elden Ring is real
Greatest game of all time. (not really but it is a very very good game that i would recommend to anyone who likes a difficult challenge and an epic story
best   game   ever
great challenge i love soul games so it feels great
Played it on xbox at first for a total of almost 2000 hours. Tried it on PC for the first time the other day and it runs so much better and every dodge actually dodges.
Amazing game, never been so immersed in a game before, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to a new gamer, as this game will single handedly be so good, that it‚Äôll make any other game look terrible in comparison
I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET I HATE MARGET
Great game with tons of replayability with different endings to discover. Bosses get harder with each new game if you want a more difficult experience. Can play with friends as well. Can't wait for the DLC.
O melhor jogo do s√©culo sem d√∫vida nenhuma
good game
very good
game slaps
Going outside ????? You mean like... to Limgrave ? Yes Yes very nice this time of year
im on my third monitor. Best game ive ever played

Sleep?

but Elden Ring!
good
The story for the game is excellent, the level design interesting.

The combat is terrible. You will regularly be killed through geometry, despite being unable to so much as damage through the same geometry. Sets of enemies will juggle you because their attack animations overlap in such a way that you can't roll away. Shields block damage, but ultimately are useless against boss fights. Most of the armor has no effect on your skills and minimal effect on your protection from damage, and the only real reason to change it is because you want to be able to medium roll. 

Having no quest log or real direction in the game is a stylistic choice, relatively unique, but having zero direction in where to go to finish side quests is more of a frustration than anything else. If someone is trying to avoid spoilers for how the game can end, looking things up on a wiki isn't useful.

Limiting the amount of times you can respec in a singular playthrough punishes buildcrafting, almost as much as the limited armor choices. So many weapons are useable, but only a handful are worth noting, and at a certain point they are prohibitively expensive to upgrade to try out.

Most of the later boss battles don't come down to your gear or skill with the game, they come down to taking advantage of the size of the boss and either doing as much damage as humanly possible in a short period of time, to cheese the encounter, or dying repeatedly trying to play defensively. The game gets boring when you realize there's approximately 10 builds capable of beating endgame content, and that you've invested 50 hours into a build that has stopped working entirely. Some bosses are so frustratingly strong that you're better off taking advantage of whatever broken mechanic there may be (as of time of writing, bleeding), going back to an earlier stage of the game, farming runes to upgrade the necessary equipment, and coming back to cheese the fight.

I kept going because I liked the story, and for a long time I was able to trudge through the combat- this is a Souls-like game right, it's supposed to be difficult. But this difficulty was and remains artificial, built into a combat system that doesn't work properly, gives unfair advantage to bosses, punishes innovation, all while often making you backtrack to boss battles, or run past enemies to find a site of grace so you don't have to run the whole section before you all over again. Is it better than simple bullet sponge enemies? Maybe. But it's kinda hard to hit something with a sword when it flips through the air 6 times and kills you through a pillar.
nice
I can't launch the game.
Melania was a piece of cake. (ÔΩûÔø£‚ñΩÔø£)ÔΩû  (i got carried by random people)
coma inducing but great
Game of the year 2024, June 21st
Class game class everything i love it
Best FS's game after dark souls 3 and bloodborne bussin fr fr no cap
ok

first souls game i played, biggest psychological rollercoaster of my life
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC GAME!
Elden Ring is an epic that redefines the boundaries of what an open-world RPG can be. It's a game that doesn't just captivate you with its story; it engulfs you in a world so vast and detailed that you can almost feel the grass beneath your feet and the chill of the wind as you traverse the Lands Between. The combat is fluid, challenging, and rewarding, with a depth that allows for a wide range of play styles. The lore is rich and woven into every aspect of the game, from the environment to the enemies and the cryptic dialogues with NPCs. Elden Ring is not just a game; it's a journey, an experience, and a masterpiece that deserves every bit of acclaim it receives. It's a game that stays with you long after you've put down the controller, and for that, it earns a resounding 10 stars out of 10.
really good its laggy some times in pvp but its overall the best game i have ever played

very challenging but awesome
The easiest FromSoft game for any player to get into the souls/bourn style games. after initial tutorial you can go anywhere and not feel forced into a corner or hit the proverbial wall that most players hit in a darksouls game.
Dark Souls 4
best game ever made

Where's the battle pass
yea
Spent over 5 hours on soldier of godrick. 10/10 would recomend
Pretty game
best world in a FromSoftware game by fare if you ask my
W
The lore, the gameplay, the struggle everything is perfect
's good
GG
very good very good
Awesome game :)
yes
1
Pretty good I guess
The worst invading mechanics completely killing any longevity and replayability and just a massive step down in pvp gameplay - compared to ds2/3 this is just a single player game.

Hopefully the dlc changes something and I can delete this review.
probably the best introduction to the souls series. super accessible and theres so much more on offer than just the challenge these games bring.
Excellent game. This is what gaming is all about.
Meh, overrated AS FUCK
Pretty graphics 
Good music
No idea what the story is, since the game thinks i will google it,and I won‚Äôt waste anymore time on this.
The combat is the same as any other souls games with a jump button now.Still the same clunky,heavy,slow combat.
The tutorial is alright and you can make it pretty far on the game.
Overall, i was expecting ‚ÄúTHE BEST VIDEOGAME EVER CREATED‚Äù and it is just open world dark souls with a horse and jumping button, it‚Äôs the same mid combat system.same absurd boss fights that require you to spend hours to learn them.
I‚Äôm getting old and i have better things to do. If you enjoy this type of games, then you will love it!
its aight
having spent 200+ hrs across platforms, i honestly believe elden ring is almost the perfect open world game.

its just like previous souls games but bigger and way more accessible for those new to the soulsborne games, or who just arent that good at them (me) with easier co-op summons, spirit summons, craftable items, more chances to respec than ds3 and easier item upgrading, but its still very difficult

good replayability with a lot of variety in how you build your character and how you tackle the game, with some story progression allowing different routes/options
Great game! But sometimes really hard.
literally greatest game of all time
started the game after 1 year of not playing... have to say i went from 2 hours to this very fast 

Really just have patience.
BEAUTIFUL
Melina sucks! F-kwlo
nice
This game broke me. 10/10, would suffer again
hell yeA
Another Fromsoftwer masterpiece, up there with Bloodborne among some of the best games of all time.

I finished my first playthrough at around 80 hours, and they were some of the most fun, engaging and interesting I can recall in gaming. Elden ring takes the classic souls formula and improves upon it in every way, from the freedom of the open world to ashes of war, new magic and miracle mechanics, improved movement and more enemy and boss variety than ever.

The visual design in particular deserves to be spoken about. It is crazy how almost every single location looks gorgeous or straight up magical, not a single area of this game has bland artistic direction, it is percect.

The result is what can only be called a masterpiece. Does it have flaws? Yes, the camera is pretty bad (they still haven't figured out how to make the camera zoom out when fighting giant enemies) and the staggering is overdone. Worth noting that while the game is beautiful, the graphics could have been better, and the optimization is quite bad, with Ray Tracing tanking performance, as well as the lack of DLSS or widescreen support.

In the end, though, I'd rate it a 9.5/10, almost perfect.
It's alright
Love the game
ight

dark fantasy

Game of the Year, of course you upvote. I Loved this game, I can't wait for the DLC!
Overrated.
It's alright
Get Gud scrub!
More than enough content and build variety. Very ambitious and overall well executed.
One of the best games ever
i beat the game 3 times way to hard
overrated. World is cool, character design is cool. other than that kinda lack luster. very repetitive, from move sets to actual locations to visit the game itself is very repetitive. Upsides enemies armor and weapons are very unique.
its good if good mean bad
really eldens my rings
peak, literal peak
is good game
Onion Ring
Probably the best game our Friends at Fromsoft have ever created, an exquisite masterpiece full of depth and wonder. would highly recommend to anyone as their first souls-bourne game and believe it has paved the way for many future titles.
Lives up to the hype
am enjoying

ishinn is harder soz
Good

It"s a open world souls game with elements from all the other Fromsoft games, need I say morer!!

One of the only triple A games so worth it these days

This is a game for MEN.
Die trying to beat the game.

Getting frustrated.

Rage quitting.

RIP my gamepad and monitor.

Bought the cheapest one.

Repeat.

(That was an alternate universe version of me. Not the real me. Honestly...)
:3

111% Kudos for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco!
For making an enchantingly beautiful game which was penned by none other than George R. R. Martin. I wonder when he will (finally) finish writing his years of postponed books. Oh, well. Back to the game again.
b(^_^)d
i think im one of the few who doesnt have problems fighting Melania.
Fun game, frustrating and worth the money for the hours you'll play.
Love this game, but i prefer playing on controller.
Elden Ring is like, for example, Shin Ramen, it's hot, it burns your mouth, but you still like it because its a GOOD burn. Same thing with Elden Ring, it's hard, but it's a good type of hard difficulty, you want to keep trying for what awaits you beyond.
Margit the Fell Omen more like Margit the Smell Omen am i right?
good game
challenging in all the right ways, though i think i'm going to hear "I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella" in my dreams for the rest of my life. i'm not complaining.
amazing and beautiful game

loaded game fought a golden horse for 3 hours then killed him
super easy a dog could play
i have down syndryom now 10/10 game, fromsoft needs to add a cutscene where ranni is oiled up tho 11/10
This stupid ass game just doesnt know how to not lag. Every 20 seconds theres a 1 min long fps drop. its like i have to play the game in 10fps constantly. even tho i have a good pc it keeps on fucking lagging. please fix ur goddamn game i been trying to fix this for half of my playtime.
Another masterpiece from master Hidetaka Miyazaki
thumbs up
As someone who has primarily played PvP FPS games for 5+ years, hasn't playing any single player games since the release of Witcher 3, and has never played any FromSoftware or soulslike game before; I am 99% sure this is my new favorite game of all time.
Masterpiece - ignore time played. I've played through previously on Xbox Series X.
Burn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.

Ahhh, may chaos take the world!

Yeah
grrrr
best game ive ever played and i have it on my xbox with 2250 hours on one save
My favorite game, did like 11 runs and didnt get bored, after new updates some map segments especially legacy dungeons are very laggy, i dont know why when the old patches didnt have this problem, other than that its 10/10 would recommend
i cant get 100% achievement because i keep simping for Ranni.
best game
yes
amazing game
gets me g'd up
its a good time

Digusting game with awful multiplayer connection, endless invades of players who abusing ping with no hits counted. Regions restricted connection setting doesn't work.

Waste of money

Simply epic.
Yes, I highly recommend Elden Ring.

This was my first Soulsbourn. I struggled a lot at first. Got frustrated and walked away. Came back. Walked away again.

Now I've played for hundreds of hours and think it might be my favourite game.  

Just excellent! 5/5!!!
good game i recommend if you want to break everything in your house hold but you can still play it
I don't see what's the "Ring" everybody is talking about. And why is it Elden ?
Thy strength befits a crown.

I think this is a prequel to Dark Souls.
This was my first Souls game and while at first it was hard to figure things out i am SO glad i stuck with it. It is not one of my favorite games of all time. Im on my second playthrough prepping for the DLC. 

If you are struggling for some context when playing the Elden Ring Fextralife wiki was an absolute lifesaver.
one of my favorite games of all time
Great game

Incredible story! Fast and fun combat. Wild enemy and character designs. Rewarding exploration and mastery of game mechanics. Feet!?

Elden Ring is GOAT in games to me. I never thought any game would beat Skyrim but Elden Ring did it. 
It's a masterpiece of a game. Elden Ring is a story that you're a part of, but not necessarily the "hero". The story was written by George R.R. Martin and then given to Hidetaka Miyazaki/FromSoftware to make the game. It was done exquisitely well. 

Then there's the weapon that is near and dear to my heart, The Darkmoon Great Sword, which is a derivative of the Moonlight Sword from another great collection of games I played many years ago, King's Field (1995). This sword is in every souls game, as a remembrance to FromSoftware's early beginnings. What has come to be known as a Soulsborne game, originated with King's Field. I loved those games, it's why I am super drawn in now. I guess I have this sentimental connection to Dark Souls/FromSoftware games, like Elden Ring. All I can say is I cannot wait for the DLC in June!
[h3]Elden Ring[/h3]

Miyazaki did it again. Elden Ring is an experience like no other. The world-building is exceptional and it really pulls you in. The bosses are memorable, even the gimmicky ones. Building your character feels better than souls games usually do to me. You have plenty of build options and plenty of weapons to choose from to fit your playstyle. The soundtrack is epic, kudos to the composers, they give that final touch to the already ambitious boss fights. I look forward to future content for this game. I also feel obligated to say that I was sorrowful when I finished it. Don't get me wrong, the game is filled to the brim with content, but as any good game should, it makes me want more and more of it.
,,,
cool
An amazing game with a really good story. The gameplay is also really emersive. It took me a week to finish this game and that week was one of the best experiences in gaming ive had. The bosses there are well made and each have their own lore/story behind them.
13/10 game

Overhyped game for nolifer masochists that requires constantly consulting a wiki and/or video tutorials. 

No sane person with a social life would find this game acceptable. I'm sure if they offered a demo version the reviews would be diametrically opposite. There is no quest log, quest givers, only asmr npcs spewing nonsensical crap. It's a game made to cause frustration. I guess that gives the devs a hard-on. I'm impressed how they managed to sell the lack of basic features as groundbreaking and genre redefining. There is so much more wrong with this game, but I don't feel like wasting more time on this than I already did.

Hmm yes, good game

Elden Ring es un souls de mundo abierto, tal cual. Con ello ganas en exploracion, en tama√±o de mapa y demas, pero pierdes con unas localizaciones mas genericas y con frecuencia enemigos repetidos.
En cuanto a la dificultad, es potencialmente mas asequible, por varias mecanicas que agregan ayudas a veces muy importantes, aunque siempre puedes ignorar la mayoria de de ellas y no usarlas.
En cualquier caso un gran juego que merece los premios recibidos

Awesome game
very attractive and addictive. There are variety of playing styles you can enjoy in this game.
Graphically Beautiful and challenging game play!
A completionists worst nightmare. Dont need to say but, amazing game.

best ever
This made me squeal for a meal
It's good.
Its Final Fantasy 1 but 3D xD Going about everything a logical way takes away ever bit of Souls difficulty.

Even when reaching higher NG+ just naturally progressing will trivialize all bosses.

It doesnt take away from the game at all for me at least.

If you want a challenge i recommend just using YT and going the main path instead of organicly exploring
good game
The game makes me want to kms. 10/10

Online game play is a trash. 9 of 10 players I found in online game play are a cheaters or extremely lag in the unplayable level. This problem existed for a long time back to the game launch. But nowadays this problem is much more worse. Why Bandai Namco ignore this problem?
too much content not enough time especially w some mods
70+ hours in, beaten the game 3 times and I just discovered a secret underground area.

its sigma
Great
GOTY for a reason, must buy game.
very sigma
maidenless are we tarnished?
Hit Max level, all achievements, and ng+7 so thought i could finally have an opinion. Pretty good game :3
Best Game of All Time. Nothing else comes close. After this game, other games will cease to be fun just by comparison. It's honestly like i have tasted the divine fruit, and now all other food has no flavor.
just good 

Goated game for goated players

Great game, challenging, beautiful, and spectacular, like a hot girl with mental problems youll never know what will hit you next. 10 outta 10 would elden again!!
its fun
Try Finger, But Hole
GOTY for a reason that moment when you defeat a boss after multiple attempts no game can compete that except sekiro and other dark souls games. Hardest boss in my opinion are Malenia and Radagon.
very hot maidens
bear, seek, seek, lest
Greatest game of all time.
Maidenless
When I first bought this game back when it first came out i hated it. It was my first souls game and i did not know what i was doing could t even tell you how many times i got lost or stuck on a boss of which i was way to underleved for. I thought it was to hard and challenging so quite shortly after deafening Mortgott. But early this year I heard that this will be getting a DLC in the summer so i proceeded to download this game once more and competently start from scratch with a new save file. But most importantly I walked in with a new mentally this time. Before i was scared and only relied on strength based weapons. I decided this time that i would play smarter not harder and that despite how many times i died that i would not give up and that i would get better and better throw every boss attempt. I think that is the best thing about souls games in my opinion is that it teachers you the lesson of life...FAILURE. Us humans fail again and again and sometimes just give up entirely. But failure it not a bad thing at all Failure is what makes us human it whats makes us learn and adapt and get good. Now that i have finished the game this is undoubtedly my favorite game of all time and i hope this  review can motive somebody to give this game another chance and experience this masterpiece.
Buy it.
Yeah, it's pretty good!

8.5/10
Finkle...is Einhorne
One of the Best, reminds me of Jak and Daxter, my fav game of all time.
Elden Ring is a shallow and empty world padded out by blatantly unfair encounters that won't even feel satisfying when you do finally overcome them. The more time passes it becomes more and more clear that FromSoftware and their fanbase do not at all understand why Dark Souls 1 was a great game.
First souls game 11/10.
It took a very long time for me to get 100% in this game and I really loved every second of it
Very fun i play modded use to play pvp was fun still fun cant wait for dlc
The best game of all time
I think its one of the absolute worst made games i have ever played. 2 years after the game is released and Torrent still has game ending glitches to where i'm walking off cliffs trying to get this shiny purple item and Torrent for some strange reason will not double jump here. Its the Malfactors evergroll right, had the same exact issue when i was playing through the first time, gave up and did not do it until i could ignore the cliff face around it. 

Why is that even what i have to do ? The riding mount i was given in the game will jump twice anywhere else on the HUGE map but will not jump twice here. its something so small but to me that makes the game unplayable. there has been countless occasions where after torrent gets killed and i land on the ground when the character is in the like " Oh no i cant get off the ground' and my PC will just be floating in the air flat like its surfing the air. 

Dont get me wrong ive put over 80 hours into this game and i own 3 dark souls games as disks and such, but these 20 plus year old games still have better basic mechanics than this sloppy game, and i mean its really sloppy. The multiplayer game modes are always glitching and the enemy invaders always seem to have either infinite invincibility frames, or can just walk through me and my other friends AoE ability's like the red lighting rain stuff. 


To bring the long rant to a close, if i would have known there would still be so many glitches and errors in this game 2 years after release i would have never bought it, its the biggest heartbreaking game ever. what a useless game
Great Game. Hard, but worth it.
My first game in the series and I gotta say I'm seriously in love with and addicted to this game, I can't get enough of it. An absolute masterpiece and a great open world experience, took a few hours to get the hang of the mechanics and get a solid grasp on the leveling system and fully understand everything, but it was totally worth it. 10/10.
The best
Awesome video game.
Maybe the real elden ring is the friends we made along the way
Too easy, beat the game six times with no weapons or armor, blindfolded, upside down, covered in coco butter. I think I fell asleep during each boss due to how bored I was. The one redeeming quality of this game is
fire
Game of the Century
i beat up a old man
Maaasssshock
my brain hurts
Since this game has come out 2 years ago nothing has come close to it. I wonder if anything will ever hold a candle to this game in my lifetime.
it's fine, I guess
aun que no lo termine lo recomiendo muchisimo es un juegazo
good
Still exploring
Souls at its absolute peak.
One of very few games I have purchased in the last few years where I felt it was fully worth 60 dollars and working at launch. 10/10

Qu√© decir, el MVP.
This is my first real dive into a Souls game.  I've attempted to get into others before and didn't.  The open world of this game is breath-taking.  After 3 start-to-finish runs I'm still finding amazing views I didn't notice the last time.  The surface lore is fine, the in-depth if you're paying attention is a pretty cool story of how everything ties together.  

I acknowledge that some of what I love about this game will be antithetical to hardcore Souls players but the fact that groups of enemies can replenish some flasks, there are bugs around that can replenish flasks and sometimes there are almost too many Sites of Grace made this game so much more enjoyable for me.  I think it could benefit from a hard mode where some of those are removed for hardcore players, but, I think its such a quality of life improvement.  

Lastly, there are S-Tier weapons and weapons that feel like cheat mode out there but just go have fun.  Find a weapon that speaks to you and I guarantee there is a way to build around it to get you to end-game.  That all being said, I'm off to start run 4 to get another ending done.  See you in game tarnished!
You should play this game
This is my 4th souls game that i plat trophied so i think i have a relatively credible opinion, so here goes:

This game is beautiful, there is a ridiculous amount of content and almost any build is viable, some boss fights are really enjoyable and the lore is pretty interesting.

As a souls fan there is no reason to not like this game, but there are also certain aspects which are unfit for soulslike game:

Most bosses are repetitive/boring and a lot of them are reused throughout the game,
Unless you pay perfect attention, the game is impossible to finish without any guides and being over/underleveled is something you come across regularly cause of the non-linear progression.

In my first playthrough, i got to the second sog (the one you talk to melina and get torrent) and rushed to margit cause in every other souls game you progress linearly. You can probably tell what happened; i got destroyed by margit multiple times, started to question my abilities then quit the game for like 2+ months.

I then came back, explored the entirety of Limgrave and almost 3 shotted margit on my first try. Bosses in this game are either too difficult cause you rushed to it without exploring or too easy cause you cleared every dungeon/cave in the area and are overleveled for the boss. 

As for actually finishing the game, i had to search multiple times to get to certain areas. If you miss a quest or a certain dialogue early on in the game, you can lock yourself out of progression and have to either backtrack significantly or use a guide to find out what you have missed. 

I still did very much like this game, but I cannot ignore certain problems in this game, I get why they went for the open world format; it is much more inviting for new players and i do think Fromsoft did a pretty good job of implementing it on the souls format. But these issues kill the replayability factor and a large part of souls games is that for me. 

I would definitely recommend this game, it is an experience every gamer should have, but i also hope they somehow fix some of the stuff i listed above in the dlc or the sequal.

I absolutely love this game, although it's probably already widespread that this is one of the best games out there.

yes
best game ever played had never played dark souls but still like this shid though the bosses can take some time

Yes, I would recommend this to other players.
such a very fun dan enjoyable game, first soulslike game ive played. 10/10!
it only starts when i jack a controller in for some reason, not complaining since i use a controller most of the time anyway, but it could be an issue for people who like keyboards. i really enjoy this game. its very pretty. it also forces me to go through a minor ego death to enjoy the gameplay, which is strangely meditative. really helps when im dealing with psychological problems. good job from soft. 
By far the best gaming experience I've ever had. Despite the game seeming difficult at first, I enjoyed every second of it, even during my second and third playthrough. Truly one of the best games of all time.

MELINA PLEASE SIT ON MY FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[i]Time of writing this review [2024/04/26] is before the release of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC[/i]

[h1] TL;DR:[/h1]

[h2]This was a difficult game to really be sure how to rate, one of the times I wish a mixed score was an option. Ultimately I decided for negative since I'm not sure if I could recommend this game at full price to most players: I'd only suggest getting it on sale (probably 33% off or more); or if you are a die-hard FromSoftware fan who is more focused on experiencing all their games firsthand at some point.

It's a game that has some incredible highs and some miserable lows. I'm interested in the DLC, but at the same time I don't think I can in good faith recommend this game at full price. If you are playing it though, I suggest turning off ray-tracing; performance is better without it and fidelity isn't affected much. I had some crashes to desktop in my experience, usually when fast travelling, though thankfully save data remained intact. I don't recall many bugs barring some graphical oddities (like a gap in the world between textures in one or two places).[/h2]

[h3]Full review below, with some key stuff in bold.[/h3]

I originally tried this game when it came out, but bounced off it quickly; eventually got round to playing it in full this year (2024). I was predominantly playing melee and solo. In some ways it felt similar to other 'Souls games, in others pretty distinct. [b]I have not played Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, so most of my comparisons are relative to Dark Souls 3.[/b]

[b]Starting with the first thing that jumps out, the visual presentation:[/b] design-wise, the game does look pretty fantastic. The visual effects from spells and weapon skills are also great to look at. Many attacks, both friend and foe, are flashier than ever and really show what the game can do at points. And weather effects, particularly snow, really help to make this feel even more like a tangible world.

What's more noteworthy though is that, outside of fast travel, there is [i]almost no loading screens[/i]: having this detail is one thing, having it run this smoothly and seamlessly is another. It makes it so much easier to get lost in.

Bar none, the graphical presentation is the strongest point of this game.

[b]But the soundtrack is part 2 of exploration.[/b] It's overall very well done, and the ambient tracks when just exploring out of combat are some of the highlights in my opinion: it really makes the Lands Between somewhere you want to delve deeper into and get just that little bit more lost on your first playthrough. There's also distinct music during combat in each area of the game too, which transitions fairly smoothly back and forth between the ambience and fits the mood of each area well.

[b]Not since Skyrim have I felt this excited to explore. The only drawback is a lack of non-hostile NPCs to talk to in the world, it's still more action than RPG. But for me that's fine, gameplay is the main appeal in a Soulslike for me.[/b]

That being said, not all tracks compare: the soundtrack in side dungeons can be a bit disinteresting compared to the overworld; and most boss themes are pretty much what you'd imagine reading "soulslike latin choir" - they're still well made, just not as memorable as some Dark Souls series boss themes. YMMV though, I just only found myself remembering boss themes from how often they were overused (one boss theme gets used 6 different times throughout the game, for instance).

[b]The story...is a standard From Soulslike story:[/b] very cryptic lore that goes into a lot of depth, and a narrative so barebones that you couldn't make a broth out of it. The side quests are also similar to previous 'Souls games; mostly in how easy it can be to softlock yourself out of a questline or getting a particular weapon or armour set if you're not following a guide. I don't mind using guides, but it does diminish the wonder that comes from exploration a little bit.

[b]Then the gameplay: as far as character control and abilities go, this is a welcome upgrade compared to Dark Souls 3 for instance.[/b] There's now a dedicated jump button that doesn't require sprinting, and the addition of jump attacks; attacking after blocking an attack enables a "guard counter" which deals stance damage like a heavy attack but is much faster, making blocking more viable; powerstance (dual wield) makes a return from Dark Souls 2, albeit only for weapons of the same class (e.g: both katanas, or both colossal greatswords); skills are expanded into Ashes of War, which on basic weapons can be freely swapped out with other compatible AoWs you have acquired as items, and are much more bombastic moves you can pull off. From the perspective of player options and buildcrafting, the combat additions are really welcome improvements.

[b]From an enemy design perspective, however, is another story. Where 'Souls usually had a reputation of "tough, but fair", Elden Ring is "tough, except if you use this one thing".[/b] Enemies have generally much higher health, damage, and poise than their otherwise near-identical Dark Souls counterparts, and poise is much less effective to withstand weaker foes. Bosses in particular can also chain attacks together rather unpredictably, in that it's often unclear when a combo is finished or if it's just beginning - many different attacks can chain into each other, and I'm not wholly convinced there's a limit to how many can be done at once. Bosses can be staggered easier than in 'Souls, although outside of colossal weapons it can be difficult to really notice any difference versus most of them. Some bosses have attacks that are a flurry of blows where you either dodge all of them, or getting hit by one means getting hit by every subsequent blow. Others have a lot of AoE attacks where landing the dodge timing is more important than getting out of the way. And the camera is still not great against massive or highly mobile bosses.

[b]All of these issues get significantly worse in the last ~25-30% of the game. Combined with the fact that the number of side options to explore instead are shrinking, it makes the last stretch a pretty brutal slog.[/b] The fact that many late-game enemies and even some bosses are reskins or even identical versions of previous enemies with much higher stats doesn't help either. I don't blame From, it feels like they just couldn't get everything in.

The last 5-10% of the game is effectively just a boss rush, which means a lot of potential walls to progression. Some of the latter bosses are just miserable solo; by the end there was no satisfaction in overcoming the challenge, just wanting it to be over.

[b]Yet, enemy behaviour hasn't really improved since Dark Souls 1:[/b] I can still use a crossbow or throwing knife to lure them out one at a time; and bosses almost never go in for the kill versus invariably swapping to another target, if you're playing with summons or Spirit Ashes. It's not really that satisfying for fights, as much as it is punching a tree in Minecraft that will sometimes drop a Creeper on top of you. I don't want to approach a boss fight and have to choose between "tedious and with no margin of error", or "fun, but the boss rarely feels threatening if you attack from separate directions".

The enemy placement is also not great, for example ambushes feel too common to the point it diminishes their impact, but compared to how it feels to fighting them it's not as much of an issue.

Overall, compared to Dark Souls, particularly 3, combat feels like a net downgrade to play. Which is an issue when ~70% of the gameplay is combat. And you still can't bind dodge and sprint to separate keys.

All in all, this was a game I sometimes liked playing and sometimes hated playing. The midgame can be enjoyable, but sadly the endgame is what stuck with me. It was a memorable game, but I'm not sure how much for the right reasons.

...I still don't know why I'm eyeing the DLC...

Foul tarnished in search of the elden mogged by the flame someone must extinguish thy flame
Mogged by the flame of ambition
An ambitious FromSoft game taking the Souls formula of games and expanding it for an open world.

All the same controls you're familiar with from Dark Souls 3 is here alongside the game-changing jump button! Other features new and returning like horse riding and power stancing are all great additions too.

Despite the scale of the world, there are plenty of beautiful and unique areas for the player to explore, with an all-round great soundtrack. Not only is there some great boss music to listen to, but also atmospheric tunes to accompany the exploration of the open world.

The bosses can be quite hit or miss at times, with some of the best and worst bosses you'll face in a FromSoft Souls game. It can be fun to take them down nonetheless, but there are plenty of bosses that would be unfairly difficult or just a slog to get through.

Despite the open-world design and the fact I could get lost in it for hours with barely a sense of proper direction (NPCs can help to guide you however), a lot of familiar level design tropes harking back to even Dark Souls 1 and maybe Demon's Souls return here and make the individual setpieces a joy to explore.

Overall, Elden Ring is a great game, it can't be denied. From Software really put their all into this game and it's clear the effort that went into crafting this game. I wouldn't say that it's my favourite Souls game from them, nor is it such a highly ranked game for me since Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne are still some of the best in my opinion. However, if you are in the need of some more Souls games and you haven't played this game yet, it's still very much worth it.
gud
the overall story line, just how appealing the game is even after beating the main storline. you're constanlty still having to find pieces of the storyline and other amazing pieces of equiment.

yeah, its okay i guess.
a game of all time
I think overall Elden Ring is great, but not as good as Dark Souls III baby!!!

Maybe it doesn't appeal to me as much, but I've never been the biggest fan of making every game an open world RPG unless theres a good way of filling it with "substance". I don't think Elden Ring has enough substance by its very essence of being a souls-like. In that I don't mean Items, but more story and interaction. An identical cave with a weapon or spell I likely won't use doesn't mean much to me. This is not to say there isn't quality in it. There is a LOT of great stuff in Elden Ring that I love, just more room than there feasibly can be stuff IMO. It makes replaying the game a lot of me just going towards the fastest way to get upgrade materials for whatever weapon I wanted and moving on. Even for a first playthrough, stuff is so spread out that I feel like as soon as I get enough for what I need it feels like a waste of time to explore. Like if I get too leveled, bosses won't get me enough runes to level so why bother? Oh boy, another ash I won't use. Etc. The quests are too far between and require too little actual exploring to force me to go places to be honest, though Ranni's and Fia's are good examples of a counterpoint. 

I honestly give it a strong 8/10, just Dark Souls 3 is like a 9.5/10 in comparison, I just want more weapons and powerstancing in it. But that's also my personal enjoyment out of a game a lot, is a nice directed experience where its tailored to have a lot of highs and not many luls from 'exploring'.
poop game and also butt
This game is freaky as hell!!!
Played a little, it was fun.
One of the best games of all time, no bullshit, no microtransactions, no battlepasses, just pure Fromsoft magic. 10/10
One of the best games of all time.
It's very challenging for a beginner, and you will die so many times, but that challenge is a rewarding part of the experience and what makes it, and all of Fromsoftware's games, so unique. The exploration and sights you can see are some of the best, with jaw dropping landscapes and so many nooks and crannies you can miss. The replayability is very high, with different playstyles and places and items to find that will keep you coming back and still discovering things. The level of discovery in Elden Ring is one that is unmatched, making the open world one that rivals the feeling Skyrim gave when it came out. I can't recommend this game enough, it's been with me through so much and has given me so much joy and fun. Just remember to keep trying and don't give up!

One of the best games I have ever played.
darnk souls
Elden Ring, to put it simply, is one of the best games that I've played in recent memory. It is a perfect blend of the tactical, timing-based combat of the Soulslike genre and rich and rewarding exploration of a massive open world.

At times that open world can certainly be overwhelming. I found that the game really shone in its more linear sections - the large and more traditional dungeons that served as funnels for the game's main story events and characters. The tighter level design in these dungeons just felt so much more satisfying to move and progress through. That being said, the larger world was still incredibly rewarding to explore - with some sort of upgrade or resource around practically every corner.

I played Elden Ring pretty thoroughly - I kept guides and Googling to a minimum for my first playthrough, but I still felt like I saw quite a bit of what the game had to offer. Towards the end of the game, but not during the "endgame", this made the game feel like it was dragging a bit, as there is just simply so much to do and explore. You never know if this mini-dungeon or that world boss will be the one to give you the exact upgrade that you've been looking for - so they can be hard to pass up. However, that is one fairly minor complaint in an otherwise stellar game.

The art style and visuals, the music and sound design, the typical fragmented and disjointed storytelling typical of a FromSoft game - they are all at their peak in Elden Ring, in my opinion. This is one of the most gorgeous and immersive games I've played, and the sheer variety in landscapes and environments is mind-boggling.

With a 100+ hour playthrough for my first time through the game, I probably will put Elden Ring on the shelf for a bit. But I know that someday I'll be returning to try out new builds, unlock new endings, and uncover new secrets in the Lands Between.
Absolutely amazing.
I bought this game twice at full price. Sad, but true. You win capitalist Michael Zaki.
This game is awesome
It made me very angry
I hate fire giant.

Amazing game. It is an adjustment if it is your first souls game but persevering is the key.
The combat is awesome, the hunt for weapons, perfecting your build and so much more keep me coming back to this game.
ofc its goated
^^
good game
Good game. Well balanced
shing shing shing pls die fire giant and buy this great game
elden ring
I have like 300 hours on this game on PS5. I just got it on here cause I'm gonna continue to play the game for the rest of my life. You don't need me to tell you it's great, just go play it. Just beware of the hours you will lose to this batshit insane world.
One tie after a ton of hours try to log back in and wow, you cant save file corrupted i lost everything for ever, that shit
One of the best games I have ever played. enough said.
yes
too ez next
If You like learning attack sequences then this is the game for you
I finished the main bosses of the game and hit the end credits after my 20th attempt. Fantastic game and hours of fun for the family to enjoy. 10/10 (although not my most enjoyable souls game :p)
one of the best games i've played
[h1][b]Elden Ring[/b][/h1]

[b]Rating: 8/10 - Great[/b]

[b]Elden Ring[/b] is [b]great[/b], it truly is but there are multiple things that hold it back from being better than [b]Dark Souls III[/b] for example. The open world doesn't do the game too many favors, it's a little too big and filled with samey dungeons and copy and paste bosses. Fromsofts quest design also doesn't work too well with an open world, making it even more convoluted than in previous games. [b]Elden Ring[/b] also has some of the worst bosses Fromsoft has ever made, too many are so big that you're fighting the camera a lot more than the boss itself. 

On the other hand, the game is absolutely beautiful; some of the best art direction in all of gaming. Locations are beautiful and many of the castles and main dungeons are very well designed and fun to explore. The soundtrack is absolutely [b]Amazing[/b] as well, creating this vivid, palpable atmosphere - and then there is the lore, absolutely masterful. Some of [b]Elden Ring[/b]'s bosses are also [b]Great[/b], some of my favorite fights ever.

In conclusion, [b]Elden Ring[/b] is one of the best games I've played thus far. While it has some [b]Great[/b] bosses it also has some of the worst, the balancing is quite off due to the open world structure of the game but overall it is a [b]Great[/b] experience.
Good Game

W Game Wish PVP Was better

Was originally skeptical about purchasing as this would be my first FromSoft title and their reputation clearly precedes them. From the moment I stepped out into the vast open world I was thrust into an incredibly immersive gaming experience unlike any i've played before. Admittedly there was a learning curve as I was new to the mechanics, of which I can honestly say could use some improvement speaking as a PC player. Through trial & error, exploration & development, I was hooked beyond belief. The world-building is as intricate as can be, allowing for myself to discover entirely new areas, dungeons, items, etc. even after my 150+ hrs in the game. In the modern age of gaming its become increasingly more difficult to justify AAA price points and I went into this game thinking it would be no different, am I glad I was wrong. The replay-ability is insanely alluring and feels like I could continue my mission as a Tarnished scouring the Lands Between for an eternity without needing to enter NG+. I would highly recommend anyone with even an inkling of interest in this game and thank yourself later by making the investment that purchasing Elden Ring is. The return on investment with this game is without bounds as you will find yourself unable to pull away just as I have. Could not possibly give a more glowing recommendation. 100000000000/10!
BEST GAME
I was blind to Souls-like games prior to this. This game exceeded my expectations wildly. The combat and timing is something that took a lot of getting used to (lots of cussing). I was frustrated frequently having the feeling that the game is unfair and to just stop playing. Then, you overcome the hurdle you've been attempting over and over again for an hour+, and you succeed! It is such a rewarding feeling! Gaming should feel rewarding, and beating big boss battles or whatnot really captures that for me.

Stunning graphics, locales, architecture, and the way the environment enhances and tells a story of it's own was incredible to be immersed in.
Rich story-telling in a subdued way
Crisp combat once you get used to it

One downside is some of the boss sizes are very awkward to fight and hit due and that can lead to frustration.

This was GOY for me!
This is the best video game I've ever played in my life.
The gameplay is pure fun and joy.
The sense of achievement after every hard step is glorious.
The exploration in this fantasy setting is amazing.
I loved the time i've spent playing this game.

Jugable
Best game in the series!
what if Elden ring was actually called Freaky Ring and instead of fighting your way through a souls-like you got freaky with the castle in the starting area. Stay with me now
Big sword go SHWING!
2 years late but whatever.

I'm not a soulsgame fanboy and a lot of them were a miss for me, so I was very sceptical of ER at first. But after the first 10 hours of playing this game, all the issues and doubts I had in my head were gone. The game runs good despite my crappy pc (5700xt/3900xt). It's a shame that there is no ultrawide support, I didn't mind the blackbars at the side since I was too focused on the game and kinda forgot about them.
In the end I went and did a 100% run and going into NG+ now. I would recommend not reading a guide for first timers and maybe use something like mapgenie at most or nothing. At least for these who love exploring things rather then point a to b gameplay.
I could talk about all of the stuff that other reviews here already talked about but for me this was clearly a hit game. My doubts were blown away and this game actually made me look forward to the DLC.

tldr - Buy it!
i love it

Insane gameplay i spent hours on this game and i don't regret buying it

Every time I get killed in this game I chug an entire bottle of windex and every time I beat a boss I grab the nearest mirror and make out with my reflection either way I use a lot of windex. And with a new dlc coming out you already know that I‚Äôm gonna be paying a few visits to the local market.

Git Gud Role Playing Game
[h1] ELDEN RING [/h1]
a game so good, I have no Idea if I will ever recover from this.

I have been playing Elden Ring for the last two years now and I can easily declare it as one of the 
best RPG games that ever saw the face of the earth. It will take a significant amount of time until a diffrent game can even come remotely close.
Remember when games like Skyrim and the Wicher 3 where one of the best RPGs? 
They are embarassing in comparison to Elden Ring. 

[b]Score: 10+/10[/b]
Elden Ring eclipses games that are considered 10/10

[h2] Elden Ring is one of two games that can be declared a AAAA-title.[/h2]
(The other one beeing BG3, I havn't played it yet.)

[b]Story[/b]
This game here is not going to take your hand, bringig you to bead and reading you a good night-tale. 
Use your brain, the lore and story are so comlex that someone attempting to explain everything made a video that is 13h long 
(and that is only part one). But when you figure stuff out... wow. 
The density, complexity and depth... (Wait who wrote the story again? OOOh yes, the GOT guy XD)

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Hard, fair, brutal, quick and not for little crybabies (looking at you quantum-TV). 
This is no game for people that played Skyrim once and think they are the Action-RPG-Master. 
This game has some of the hardest bosses in all of videogame-history and the kick you get from defeating them is glorious. I struggled the most with Maliketh btw...

[b]Art[/b]
Bruh, look at this game. How do you not give this a full score. Same goes for the music. It is so unmistakenly FromSoftware. 
God-tier.

No this is for all the AAA-Devs out there. Especially Ubisoft and EA. Your games are declared shite because games like this exist.
Why would I play Skulls and Bones when I also have the choice to play Elden Ring. Dear Devs put effort into your games. Take ER as an exsample how it's done.
Best game of all time

The story, scenery, NPCs, armors, Weapons, skills spells and everything else is just great to lose yourself in :D
Hard game, very fun.
But it is very complicated, unfortunately the game doesn't teach you good enough how to play.
Best first playthrough I've had in any game. Please give Fromsoft games a try. They put so much heart and soul into their games. :)
Ranni.
perfect game
good 

Adoro de ti Elden Ring!
Trash but I played the trash for 225h.
The old codger has lead me to many a treasure, none more great than the game its-self
Elden Ring DLC Waiting room. . .


THE GOAT
had to cut off the girl i was talking to so i could focus on getting all the achievements
yes
My friends think I'm insane for enjoying FromSoft games.... well I think their lack of getting good is what makes THEM insane. I've played every Souls game to date and this game has the merits & accolades that speak for itself. Such an incredible title, so much that I was determined to perfect this game, which I did. The open world concept is such a breath of fresh air to the series. Very punishing, yet so rewarding when you conquer tough foes and bosses. And now that we have the DLC on the horizon, I CANNOT WAIT TO BE PUNISHED MORE. QUIT BEING A BABY AND DEFEAT RADAGON & ELDEN BEAST!
Well THAT just happened!
It is generally a good game, however there are things that are extremely disrespectful to the player's time. For example, running to the boss arena each time. Then they put an npc that will chase you to boss arena, so when you summon your spirit the spirit will sometimes attack the npc behind the invisible wall rather than the boss. They must have realized these, and these are all design choices. If it wasn't for these, I would give it a 10/10, but honestly towards the end, through all the chores you have to go through, the game stop being a game and just turns into a tiring mess. And even worse, some of the final bosses, I won't spoil, give you such poor frame rates... That you can't even properly dodge, and when bosses have one shot attacks, if you have low frame rate for a slight second you just die... I have RTX 4k and I can play Cyberpunk 2077 almost with no performance issues... What  alet down, after 70 hours of gameplay.
Greatest game of all time
Do you like video games? Then play Elden Ring.

120 hours. Countless deaths. One tarnished, forever changed. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a baptism by fire (and lightning, and giant crabs). My first Soulsborne experience? Brutal. But the sweet release of victory after conquering a monstrous boss? Pure elation. Explored every corner? You bet. New Game +6? Bring it on, Lands Between. Elden Ring is a masterpiece of open-world design, challenging combat, and a world begging to be unraveled. Prepare to die. Prepare to love it.
Weak foe, Ahead.
Came back to 100% the game before the DLC and man is this game big. Nothing beats the feeling of the first play through but everything after that feels tedious. This feels especially true in the endgame where the scaling is unbalanced and you don't really want to farm or beat side content that you have already done to level up. I know a lot of people have the same take and I am sure that there will be plenty of people who can enjoy this game even after they have done everything but I just want to put my thought out there. The first play though alone brought me true Wonder and I'm sure the DLC will be just as good.

Best game ever!
It is the best game I have played since dark souls 3
Near-perfect game, 10/10
Another classic fromsoft game, if you're a fan of the franchise or looking to break in it's an exciting experience. Things to be mindful of outside of the difficult fighting mechanics, is the constant need to look item locations and map locations up on external websites.
I killed the first big story boss and got portet to some sort of Base. 
The first guy in there tells me that this is a peaceful place no fighting and stuff. 
I think cool no need to spend my 11k from the boss yet, time to explore. 
Then i jump down a balcony and am locked in to fight an invading blood frost scythe dude. 
Neither dying nor quitting the game got me out of there after retrieving my stuff. Had to spend 2 hours until i killed it to get out WITH my hard earned stuff.  
7/10 at best if everything else is working perfectly.
This game is pretty hard but if you are willing to commit to it you'll have a great time.
amazing
magnificent
Decent
this game made me want to physically harm myself for the first time

The fallen leaves tell a story.

The great Elden Ring was shattered.

In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.

Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,

and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.

Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.

A war from which no lord arose.

A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will. Arise now, ye Tarnished.

Ye dead, who yet live.

The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.

The ever-brilliant Goldmask.

Fia, the Deathbed Companion.

The loathsome Dung Eater.

And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

And one other. Whom grace would again bless.

A Tarnished of no renown.

Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.

To stand before the Elden Ring.

And become the Elden Lord.
good game
Amazing.
Being semi new to souls-like games I did not know what to expect, after beating it 7 times and completing all the achievements I can say this game is the best I have ever played and it convinced me to go back and experience other Fromsoftware titles.
I like it so far, holy it's hard. It's my first souls game wish me luck....
its cool, ig
not my type of game but its really good

FromSoftware really does not disappoint with their Soulsborne games. The same can be said with Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a really large, open-world, soulsborne game and I'm not kidding when I say it is. In comparison to all the other Soulsborne titles (idk about Sekiro never played it yet), I'd say Elden Ring takes the cake. I've spent like hours and even stayed up on nights just exploring the lands between because it's so open world to the point where you're not gonna finish the game in just one sitting! And the best part, you aren't limited to what you want to do in this game. If you're having trouble getting past a boss, you HAVE the option to skip it and come back (I'd recommend looking up farming techniques). I first had it on the PS5 but because it's decommissioned at the moment, I resorted to PC for now.

The only main problem I have about this game (on the PC) is that because the file size is really big, I think it's contributing to the amount of lag spikes while playing the game. My PC is an New Alienware Aurora R10 so maybe I need a stronger PC. That being said, you also aren't able to play the game very well if you have many other applications open in your desktop (which most of the time I just open one browser to look at the Elden Wiki for tips).

Besides that though, 10/10 I recommend playing it but 8/10 because it may require you to have a stronger PC to handle this game.
No maidens?
its ok

Incredible.  The most polished and refined Souls game yet.

Try finger but whole
If I could play this game again for the first time I would
Elden Ring more like skibidi sigma.
 very good game but the elden ring was destroyed when i got to it, a bit disappointing.
good lord buy this game, the sheer amount of content is insane. best thing to hit the market since minesweeper
If you like hard games or From Software, you will love this. Even if you don't really like hard games, you may still really enjoy this, as there are so many built-in tools and features that make this one of the most accessible From Software games out there. You don't need to be a great gamer to finish this game, but you can also make it very difficult if that is what you are in to.
Easily one of my favorite games of all time.
best game ever!!
it epic
Elden Ring is quite simply a modern classic, a game that will one day stand toe to toe with Mario brothers, The Legend of Zelda, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, and every other game that has endured for decades. This is one of the best games ever made and you can't go wrong playing it. There's a very high chance you will end up sinking dozens of hours into several playthroughs. Play this game
Truly an amazing piece of work. The boss designs and lore are incredible. The world is simply breathtaking. Combat is very smooth and feels great. The game is very rewarding to those who like to explore and you can really feel the progression when you've put in the time and effort. The game is hard, (as expected from a souls game) however, it is extremely fulfilling once you've figured out what you're doing.

The only complaints I have are in relation to the targeting system (which can be a little annoying at times) and the weird positioning of some sites of grace in certain dungeons. The lack of a journal to track quests is also a little a bit of a nuisance but I wouldn't say it's a major design flaw. I also wish there was a civilian population of some sort that you could speak to or even find because who are we meant to be ruling over after we become the Elden Lord? Who are we fighting for exactly?

Overall though, Elden Ring is very solid and has been a joy to play. I could honestly play this game forever and I cannot wait for the DLC!

Stupid ass infuriating bs, not the game, super great and fun, but so fucking poorly optimized that it just suddenly decides to not launch with controllers plugged in 4/5 times you open your computer with no clear solution. Love paying 40-70$ for a game I can barly play even with compatible specs and drivers. Seen so many people struggle with the same, even multiple months ago, fix your broken ass shit game please and thank you
best game
Elden Ring came to me in a time in life that I very much needed what it had brought me, and I didn‚Äôt even know what that was when I bought it! 

I was in a bad situation for a long while and happened to be watching Jacksepticeye videos on YouTube when I was in a safe and healthy space. I used to play video games all the time when I was younger, but prior to my partner getting me a steam deck last year I hadn‚Äôt played games in 11 years.

Well one day I watched an older upload of Jacksepticeye playing through Bloodborne, was completely enamored by it and had never seen a game quite like that. So on my deck I had already been playing Doom 2016 and the older Doom titles that I grew up with. And I looked up From Software.

I had no idea what I was getting into, I bought Elden Ring on a whim and I absolutely love all the souls games now. This game affected my life in a positive way. It challenged me, pushed me, hell I went in blind and got stomped! I had no idea what I was doing for the first 120 hrs! There are so many mechanics that now I‚Äôm still learning how to be more efficient and effective with my character and weapon builds. The story and lore are awesome and I am excited to see what everyones experiences are in the DLC coming up!

While I know these games aren‚Äôt for everyone, if you are curious I would give it a go. You will die, you will learn and you will become better! The game is beautiful and fun, good luck out there fellow Tarnished!

Awesome Game!

i cant play this game its want to pay again
Yes.
FOUL TARNISHED !!!!
Dog! 

It's aight.
The second most palatable Fromsoft game out there but easily the most fun of them all if you like fighting other players. Yes, Elden Ring PvP is even better than the child of god itself, Bloodborne.
Elden ring is one of the games on steam. Solid game, Its alot more fun if you play with the semi-seamless mod. I would recommend 8/10

:er_wave::er_angry::er_sweat::er_uwu::er_heart::er_sad:
Started like a miserable I burned a tree and married a cute witch. 10/10
Jokes aside it's probably the easiest Souls-like, I think it's the right starting point for people who want to try Dark Souls but are afraid of the difficulty. If you can't play even this you just suck and don't even try buying a Dark Souls.
haha funy gaem
So, all I really have to say is that pve and open world is okay, lots nice areas with interesting enemies, cool weapons, and armor sets. Lore is weird especially if you're trying to understand it through your play through. Bosses in this game are repetitive af, lots of copy paste mini bosses, but there are some cool main ones. Don't get me wrong I loves souls games but where I personally found this games fails is through pvp, I guess coming from ds3 pontiff shi**er invasions my opinion may be too harsh on the game but I really think there's a lot that needs to be done with the current state of the pvp aspect, starting with invasions. To put it simple they are very unbalanced and all odds are usually against the invader, from getting bad spawns, immediately getting ganked and spammed to getting taunter tongue cancelled as soon as you join another world with the host and 2 other phantoms and worst of all never getting a teammate. Maybe somewhere to start would be make a game with 2 phantoms automatically open the doors to allowing 2 invaders at once without taunters.. Additionally, the network on pc for this game is absolute trash, im not 100% sure its because of the anti-cheat but it really doesn't help pvp at all, you should expect to get phantom hits from a mile away and also expect to see other players in arena floating around, I have good internet and have not had any issues on any other games including the previous souls games. I have a few different characters ranging between lvls 125 to 200 and its safe to say that ive only seen the same thing across all of them in regards to invasions at least. Over leveled phantoms and the game encouraging players to spam, especially wizards lol. I don't really have much else to say but I hope at least some changes are made to the online aspect in the future lol.
better than ds

Best game, amazing visuals and open world. Super fun combat :)
I LOVE ELDE NERING!!!!!!!!!!!
thought i wouldn't like it after first horse boss... then after killing it without ever leveling up i quit the game for like 2 years before i went back and beat it now, its hella fun now lol. good game.
the absolute best game of 2022 hands down please play it i feel so bad for anyone that hasn't
i think its pretty good
I feel like shit at work because of this game. 

Definitely an 11/10.
fun

If You have Ballz of Steel and grew up on Classic NES, and can beat Contra w/o Konami Kodes... This is "Your Bag Baby, Yeah!! " Controller Slammin' Koas!!  Great Graphics, great Weapons.  You get a Elk to Ride in this FromSoft -  8.9 /****
buy if u like being told that u died
Play it for the memes if nothing else.
elden ring
tOP 3
yesso. last played 2022.. platted it and stopped now we bk ( waiting for dlc ) :D' 
still an amazing game.
game is great, shutup and buy it
I think it's a quality game as many people before me have stated. If you're looking for darksouls, then this isn't it though. A lot of the late game bosses will deal a lot more damage than you expect and the lack of openings in bosses especially late game can be infuriating. In general the replayability of this game is top notch, and the gameplay itself is incredible. With a stunning world to look at and an open world bigger than almost any other I've played, this game is easily worth the price it's asking for. Though I don't agree with how fast some of the bosses go, or how much damage is dealt late game, I can appreciate this game for what it is. That being a masterpiece.
I watched you slowly grab me by my waist, pull me in and whisper " I am Malenia. Blade Of Miquella. And i have never know defeat. "
This was my first soulslike game and I was not disappointed!

Loved every moment of the game down to the boss fights, the scenery, the different builds you can choose from, the weapons and spells. Its truly a masterpiece and has been one of the most memorable games I've played.

Replayed through it around 10 times now and that number will 100% grow once the DLC comes out : )
It's pretty good. I bought it twice lol
My first FromSoft game and not my last.
cool game
yes
very funb with engaging fights... for the perople who say its hard... ive played dark souls and vs that this is more on the easier side of finding where to go...


note leveling yourself up is crucial to make sure you can live is helpful you can explore all around too look for grave yards which will have stone coffins and if you collect them from limgrave and weeping penisula it can help you get to level 15+ 
dont get discouraged and if anything just take it slow.

i sycked horribly at these games but i got better over time.
Such a great game. wished i discovered it sooner.

Get good and you will probably die still, but not as much....probably...
I got it yesterday and ive played 27 hrs'
This is my first Souls type game, and I absolutely love it! I love the cinematics and the animations, all very smooth. The boss fights can be challenging, but that's the whole point! These fights are intense and beautiful, and it's a thrill to do them!
 its so hard without help or some one telling you what to do, for me the first 10 hours were so hard and impossible to play but after that it is so fun and i love it. the boss fights mainly the cutscenes are so good the voice acting is 100
10/10
I am malenia, blade of miquella
One of the best multiplayer open world RPGs to be released in recent years. There's at least over 100 hours of content to enjoy across The Lands Between in your first playthrough. Check out the Seamless Co-op mod for the most fun and smooth experience with your friends.
tree :)
love
Top 5 of all time for me
Prob the best game I've played in a couple of years.
Perdi muitos dias produtivos jogando essa porra
10/10
All my playtime is on ps5. This is my favorite game. If you are reading this for some reason... believe the hype and dive in. Cheers.
good game. love this game
best game ever made
I can't get past Margit
I would not fuck Melina... But I would SMASH the Albinaurics and or Wormface
136 hours in and I'm still not even kinda done. Some might say I need to get good.
I've never so happy yet so angry with this game its unreal
try finger but hole?
very good great story and graphics 10/10
my baby
sadism
amazing ahh game beautiful ahh game lovely ahh game
Epic fantasy exploration game.  Absolutely earned it's game-of-the-year award for 2022.

Good entry-level game for anyone thinking about trying a soulsborne game, with good challenges for veterans of the genre.
te amo
Game of the decade
it's good
is gud
My dad actually was near the beginning of the game so I could early game say hi to my dad which is something I haven't seen from many games highly recommend saying hi to my dad
great game
gud game
bangerrrrr
Best RPG game ever, great job FromSoftware
good
good game
gud
I need mommy Melina

Play with the Seamless Co-op Mod for an amazing co-op experience.
play it
game of the year more like SHITTIEST GAME OF THE YEAR, dont play this its not worth your sanity I literally had to beat an old lady because of this game it pisses me off so much
I've had trouble accommodating to FromSoft games in the past. I figured this one would be no different: I try, I die, I quit.

For whatever reason, I've yet to introspect too much on it, I can't stop playing.

It's still fairly difficult to play for a newbie like me, but it's still the more approachable experience.

I now wish to give DS1 & DS3 another shot with this newfound appreciation at hand.
Masterpiece.

I'm afraid I'll never like any other game as much
praise the turtle pope <3
Its fun
In my first run of this game, I found myself in love. Of course I used the stupid dex/int build that everyone uses, but that's besides the point. The game is beautiful. The story is lovely. The fights are tense and the victories are rewarding (except Malenia, fuck Malenia). This game is a fantastic way to introduce someone to the soulslike genre.

That being said, as a modding nut, I think I wouldn't be playing this game nearly as much as I do if the modding community around this game wasn't as massive as it was. I can imagine myself doing a dozen runs due to the sheer number of weapons, classes, and mods at my disposal.

Thank you Miyazaki for this masterpiece
got maidens
the most magical of souls games :3
One of the GOATs
I 100% on Xbox and am back to do it again. Easily on of my fav games of all time and top two Fromsoft games.
I died at least 7 times
Worth the pain and money.
it is a BIG Souls game, what else do you need to know ???????
Maybe the real elden ring was the friends we made along the way
I have no idea how I lasted 66 hours on this so far.
Pretty good, after 2 broken controllers
Definitely one of the best games I have ever played, try it.
Great game.You could play for 1000 hours and still not use every weapon.You WILL die a lot,THAT IS THE POINT,every single time you die you get a little more knowledgeable on that boss.And if you think Malenia is too hard...fair point BUT waterfowl dance is quite easy to dodge,bro just search up a tutorial...or use mimic tear.So yeah you can spend probably hundreds of hours into the game and have no IDEA certain areas exist and using mods like the convergence mod it prolongs the amount of time you can enjoy game by a huge amount and you can find pretty much everything you need on sites like nexus mods and more mod sites.so overall its an amazing game,but people get mad when its too hard but if anything its too easy if you know what your doing,Example:Mohg's great spear (if you are mad about PVP just download seamless co-op or just dont play PVP at all)
My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on this game and it gets 3333 likes and 1666 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 2 Kilos of canned ham. So I'm just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha!
One of the best games ever created. But fuck Malenia and her dumbass fucking waterfowl dance and her dumbass scarlet rot.  Also fuck Mohg Lord of Blood's dumbass aoe bloodfire that covers the entire fucking arena that is already covered by graves that block you. Fuck you Mohg and fuck your Nihil.

p.s. Why the fuck can Malenia heal after every hit? That was a dumb fucking idea. I could understand if she healed after she damaged you like a lifesteal, but she heals AFTER EVERY HIT even if you block she heals. Fuck you Malenia and fuck your blade.
fricking amazing
HELL YEAHH

After 200 hours of gameplay, I can say that I finished every corner of this masterpiece, every land, every boss, every site of grace found,  was like peace in the middle of a war, damn, I don't know how to explain how I dedicated so much time to learning  the lore of this game, I can say that I am not a soulslike player nor do I have experience in the area with these games, but I cannot remain indifferent to what I call a piece of art, the fascinating story/lore combined with an extraordinary game detail of the character makes the experience absolutely insane, I can't count how many times I got lost exploring this map, cuz the game doesn't really tell you what to do but was really challenging but at the same time rewarding. It was an amazing time that I spent  just contemplating the beauty of different areas, and I can say that the effort made to create this game was worth 100% it. Big props to fromsoftware for bringing the DLC. LETS GO!
Didnt expect bloodstain, seek skill.
amazing
Its a pretty good game.

8/10. This game needs fishing in it, and maybe an expansive cooking mini game.
My only problem with the game is its concept of difficulty for the last few bosses in the main story. I think difficulty only makes sense when there are things you get a grasp of and they help you get through the whole game, if you master them well enough. But the last few bosses, actually just Godfrey and Maliketh, is just constant spam of attacks that barely give you any time to fight back, 90% of the time you are just trying to evade attacks, it is no fun. But other than that it is a great game, definitely worth the money and the time.
this game too easy
I like it
awesome

greatest game of all time
Game of the Year for a reason
git gud
its a masterpiece

SMASH

Fun and rewarding
game of the decade for sure
real
Yeah its good, but can we get voicechat?
Becomes boring after a few hours
As someone who played all the soulsborne games. I highly recommend this game. Great graphics, great story so far, and the mechanics are good! If you dont like soulsborne games or have anger issues that you'll punch your monitor or break controllers.....play it.

fun

I really like this game. Graphics are beautiful, and the story is very entertaining and the game play is suitable challenging. I'm not a fan of the problem of how to figure out which ending you want and how to achieve it, but by the time you get there I guess they expect you to look on the internet to find out how you want to get the ending you want and then do it again? Overall this was really fun.

STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE ELDEN RING!
Compralo papu esta godüëç
best game ever
Elden Ring is really fun on your second run through, a major issue is how limited your builds actually are during the first run, pretty much int, str, or bleed, but once you've done one run and accumulated everything you can actually experience the game and it's incredible.
Beyond exceptional in every way. A masterpiece. Nothing more to say.
p
Best game I have ever played hands down. Customisation is on point, and the difficulty of facing bosses makes the game incredibly fun to play. World building and fantasy lore is on point.
very good game and made me find out i have severe anger issues but dont regret playing and i really recommend getting this game
good game
They should make a dating simulator where instead of defeating all the bosses you need to romance them; they should call it "Eldin Fling".
Mah friend got me this game and its the best rpg i've played i would rate this game 10/10 and wish i could erase my memory to fight the main boss again for the first time 

(Sir Gideon is the hardest boss in the game and Malenia the easiest so far.)
THE LOATHSOME DUNG EATER
Hard
must play game
looks cool cool looking coool scary and cool adventure
I want ranni to abuse me in all 4 hands :3
It's fun and I do recommend it, but don't be upset when this game feels so unfair that it seems broken. If the game seems like it's unbalanced in a certain way, try building your character in a different way or simply restart and choose a new class. I recommend Samurai.
best game of all times
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH ELDEN RING!

Great game, Absolutely love it, One of the best Souls Games I have played.
100% recommend it to someone who hasn't played Souls games before!
This game ungayed (as in unhomosexual) me. I no longer like men and neither I do this game
One of the best games ever and I play PC games for around 25 years. Gameplay, graphics, variety, storyline, atmosphere all at maximum level. Cant wait for the DLC.
thumbs up
The game is a straight masterpiece. Was my first souls like game and was initially turned off by the learning curve. Came back finally and gave it another shot and just wow, what an amazing game. Couldn't help but to explore every corner, find every item and kill anyone and everything to become the Elden Lord. One of the few games that kept me hooked from start to finish and completing every achievement. Cant wait for the DLC to drop and continue the journey.
Elden Lord have mercy I'm about to bust
another very word game
10/10 got me into souls likes also, I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella I am Malenia.

This Game is Amazing over 1400 hrs in
Rage inducing boss fights. Beating them gives me a stiffy. 10/10 would recommend
it can be difficult but one of the most rewarding games i have ever played
I genuinely dislike this game. I don't know why, it's just not for me. That being said, it's through no fault of the game itself as it is an incredible game and worth trying yourself. Just don't feel you did something wrong if you can't get into the groove of the challenge it imposes.

this games ate my life
I had never played Souls-like games before trying Elden Ring. However, the idea that I could take things at my own pace and immerse myself in the beautifully designed world encouraged me to give it a shot. Now, I‚Äôm completely hooked on its gameplay and story, making it my favourite game. I was hyped to learn that one of my favourite writers contributed to the story. 

The replayability is excellent, and I love creating new characters to explore different endings and creating a story for each one of them.

Elden Ring is truly a masterpiece, the challenging gameplay has captivated me at the end of the day and also encouraged me to explore other Souls games without fear. :)) This game is a testament to what video games can offer in terms of both beauty and challenge.
Good and easy. Bosses too easy. Need to be harder. Black Knife assassin is bad tho.
is fun
no

I mean, what more needs to be said. It got GOTY after all.
best game ever, easier than dark souls 3, recommend to watch some youtube before playing
Nice
Is there anyone in the Lands Between that loves men?

Mohg:
Elden Ring was my first soulslike.
It was kinda overwhelming when starting but I had tons of fun in my first blind run.
Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game.
You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world, enjoy the view and smaller bosses.
The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in-game. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead.
big sword funny

if you die just get gud bozo

I am realizing that I didn't play openworld game before. I thought I did. This is my first fromsoftware and souls game. Definetly won't be last. Best game ever I guess. Wth.
Visually amazing and overall challenging for a first time player would recommend if looking for something out of your comfort zone :)
One of the best games I ever played on my life.

Anyway she's called Malenia, and if you hadn't figured it out she's also the blade of Miquella
Best game in the world. You like Soulsborne games? Soulslikes? No? Don't care, you have to play this.
Your can beat up women
[b] One of the games of all time [/b]
Elden Ring therefore offer but hole.
 very gud
bonk
.
Gosh, the game is boring.

The first playthrough was entertaining, the open world looked nice, the plot... well, what could you expect from FromSoft? It's complicated. Finished the game in around 100h or so. But NG+ is a way different [spoiler]Elden[/spoiler] beast...

Exploring got boring and repetitive, the game is literally too big and the open world became a major drawback. I couldn't really form an emotional connection with the NPCs, the plot is overly complicated even for FS standard and after sometime I did not care about the world and my role as a Tarnished in it. Maxed all the achievements, uninstalled Elden Ring, won't return nor buy the DLC. 3/10
FANFUCKINGTASTIC
good
great game
Gud
Imba trash
Dark Souls II >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> whatever this is
Its okay i guess
great game
i haven't played much of the other soulsborne but from the little bit that i have played, it is a good entry level game to those new to soulsbornes. aside from difficulty, it has excellent worldbuilding, great story, fun yet challenging boss fights, and much more. 10/10 would recommend.
absolute joy to play, no matter how many playthroughs you go through you still enjoy it like your first time.
[b] Truly the best game with the most exciting world, bosses, characters, NPC, etc. I highly recommend you buy this masterpiece. Miyazaki San <3 [/b]
best game of all time best review of all time
game hard asf
IT WAS SO TO FUN PLAY WITH FRIENDS.SEAMLESS CO-OP MOD I LOVE YOU.CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE DLC TO COME OUT
Absolute beast of an RPG for anyone who likes the souls series. The world vast and fascinating, and you constantly discover new things. The game also has around 230 bosses which some are quite challenging and exciting. Of course some of them are not. The game is very welcoming to new players but for veterans it is quite easy (so far) but one can always amp the difficulty artificially by investing stats differently or not using certain skills. You make the difficulty. The only downside is that there are too many "bonfires" in this game. There also appears to be quite a lot of replayability since some quests lock some areas which one may or may not discover on first playthrough. 

For newcomers, it may take some time to adjust to game mechanics and such but once you do, you will love it like everyone else who doubted souls series but ended up loving them. 

9.5/10
Very good you can all kind of challenges an it's so expansive
RAHH !!! RANNI ENDING !!! SIMP ENDING !!!
BEST GAME RELEASED DURING THE AGE OF THE STARS !!!
hg
u want sth new, challenging, life changing, and an amazing open world bigger than anything u have seen? if yes this is meant for u. totally worth every last cent u spent to buy this game. 

(if this is ur first time playing souls game, in the beginning it is very hard to play the game but once u get the hang of it ull love the game and ull get addicted to it. sth u dont have to forget is all u have to do is not to loose hope and not letting failure overcome ur mind. i spent 100hrs in this game n enjoyed every second i spent on it and after all that hours im at final bossüòÇno ng+ nothing its my first play through. )
Try Finger but hole
as someone who started souls games on console and eventually ventured to pc I can say that it id worth it, not only can you play the game from steam and all your friends on pc as well, but if you so choose you can mod the game giving it endless possibilities. i personally just beat the convergence overhauls beta and found it to be really fun.
i learned how to use a controller to play this game properly
Life is like a game the only why to win is to die
You will never get those hours of your life back. I love this game. It is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. You will regret nothing. Don't do it. Here I go again. Never again. You have plenty of hours left.
W game
I "try finger, but hole" and now I'm "maidenless". 10/10 would recommend

I killed a slave and he turned into a giant bear. I love this game.
best game of all time
best game in resent history no doubt about it.
Other than the game crashing at some points for no reason and EAC being a pain, this is a great souls experience. A little sad that you need a thirdparty mod to properly play with others
gud, love dis game
No other game has made me want to smash my head through my table as much as this.
11/10
yes!
I was addicted to Fentanyl before i played this game now im to the game and Fentanyl.

Do you know what insanity is? It's walking into a room, seeing the same tree, hearing the same words for a thousand times and expecting something to change. 

Truly a blade of miquella moment
masterpiece
Great Game
real good
what else can i say
please fix the pvp its so bad in this game
I really enjoyed spending my time playing Elden Ring. If you like challenging games and have the patience to learn from your mistakes Elden Ring is for you!
Simply the greatest game of the decade. Would recommend to everyone!
I found maiden :)
I havent beaten it yet :)
God please help me escape my eternal imprisonment AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 

good game
good game
It is my first souls game and it is amazing! The simplicity of their menu and items description makes it a bit complicated at first consider how game companies babysit their users in today's age. 
I can spend hours playing and never get bored as there is always a new mistery, new bossess, quests I forgot I accepted and grinding. 
The game is HARD, if you have no problem grinding you should be fine, you'll die a lot slowly.
If you want to charge at everything at once, it is possible but, you'll die ... lot and faster.
It gets you thinking, frustrated, inmersed and completely fascinated about their story.

One thing I have to mention, if you skip dialoge, prepare to spend hours searching on how to do things or searching for information on the internet. 
If you like to read, there is a change that you might need to read one thing or two if you are getting desperate. 

I would give this game 9.9/10. I'd like to upgrage my armor or perhaps, choose how my character looks like if I had discovered new equipment(looks only). I know it would go against the nature of the game but, it'd be a cool detail. 

Hoowy
Dog ahead. possible death. 100000000000000+/10
gewd
GOOD
If you are new to the game i recommend using the samurai since you can use the bow and katana which are useful in many situations, not only could i attack groups without getting stampeded to death with the bow, i could also get massive damage in with the katana using the "sheath" skill along with the bleeding effect. The samurai is the way to go if you are new, at least from my experience.
Been a while since i put this many hours into a game. I played it on PS% but got to Liurnia and let it go. Feels alot better on PC with Mouse and Keyboard. 60 hours in, want to ready up for the Erd Tree expansion. LOVE THIS GAME!
I have played enough of this game to know that red-haired woman is called Malenia and she is the Blade of Miquella.
This game is just amazing, I love everything about it 10/10 for me
try fingers,
but hole.
yes
it gud
Amazing display
qwWWAD
Held with those of maiden-less characteristics.
Dark Souls 1, but bad
Goated as fuck
Just beat Melania, thank god it's over
Took me a while to finally get it but it is well worth all of my money, it's so fun and with what feels like endless stuff to do in it. A nice challenge compared to practically every other game where this is actually hard and takes lots of skill.
Imma be real, I didn't really like this game when I first tried it, Mainly cause I couldn't get passed the first boss, as well as dying to An enemy with a Health bar and my friend making fun of me for it.
But now that I've played it more, I honestly Love this game, It's challenging yes. But it's Fun, and that's why I Love it so much. So if you haven't played it, I recommend you play it, and I couldn't recommend it enough.
It was and still is a Blast to play.
goated
Im doodoo Fart at this game but fun to play around in
I have beat Elden ring 3 times it is the first souls like game i have ever played about 160-80 hours of content is amazing and newgame+ scale the bosses health and Damage they deal forcing you to make new builds more devastating than the next 10/10 would recommend  WARNING THO EXTREME RAGE AHEAD FOUL TARNISHED
I, I am not maiden less.
such a chore half the time
BECAUSE I SPAWN DIE

There is a solid foundation and a lot of potential, but the multiplayer aspect has been completely scuffed.

Reading past interviews with Hidetaka Miyazaki, such as Eurogamer's Soul Survivor, makes me sad because I feel like his vision of multiplayer was truly stupendous, but the execution was very lackluster.

Co-op makes the game too easy, breaking the intended experience of overcoming hardship, as the enemy AI are just not designed around dealing with multiple players, and the advantages of cooperation are so great that being invaded is more like a minor inconvenience than an actual threat.

Invading can be fun, it can be tedious. What sucks though is that you cannot co-invade with friends. The second password summoning was made a thing back in Dark Souls 3, co-invasions should have also existed. If players can progress with friends, they should also be able to invade with them. Having to host and gank for co-op PvP or using the lackluster arena is just. . . boring.

Arena is lackluster. It somehow has less variety than the arena in Dark Souls 2 and 3. Three flat maps, one with pillars. . . excuse me?! Rather than using the password system, we need to be able to host lobbies and fine-tune rules so we don't just have one elimination mode and a bunch of timed death-match modes. Where is my 2v2 or 3v3 elimination?

Due to how multiplayer works in this game, the lack of natural solo invasions, inability to be invaded in areas where the boss is cleared, lack of covenants, amongst other features missing from previous titles, Elden Ring does not really have a post end-game for those that fall in love with its mechanics but want to do something other than progress the story with the same enemy placement for the millionth time. Dark Souls 2 has some neat features that this game could really make use of ranging from multiplayer mechanics such as post-game invasions to new game plus features such as new enemy placement.

It sucks because I really like this game, but I really do not like the overall direction FromSoft/Bandai have been taking multiplayer where it has been started to feel more like a half-baked afterthought rather than an integral part to the core experience.
fun and ez
you don't have the right, O you don't have the right.
Great and hard game that will let you play how you want. 

it good
Good.
I liked it some.
10/10 most aesthetically pleasing game ive ever played. cant wait for erd tree
Its Pretty Neat
I am a souls veteran, and I initially had trouble getting into elden ring. I noticed the animations were unfair and there appeared to be input reading. However, after pumping my HP with ended up being a very fun and memorable game. I think it was the direction they needed to go for veteran players, but I'm not sure how this will treat players new to the series. 

I Strongly recommend all new players read every tutorial the game offers and make sure you understand what it is telling you. I regretted every tutorial I skipped. Also Make sure you understand how spirit ashes and multiplayer work. This will also help your enjoyment of the game if you are a new player.
best souls but thats opinion. best game to start new comers i feel, if you feel trapped just go somewhere else and get farm or do something else. great exploration
Not at all fun. Very inconsistent mechanics.
The game is very good. While I agree some certain bosses are questionable, if you don't like the bosses in this game as a majority, you may just be bad.
i died
The greatest.
good game
it's very good
I could play this for ever and ever.
good elden scroll game best one in the series
The Souls games by feet connoisseur Miyazaki are by far my favorite games, they are the only ones that constantly kept me coming back to gaming. Especially Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring. I love how crisp and precise the movement feels on KB/M. Simple and robust mechanics that feel great <3.

Literally can't get this game to launch after playing 92 hours.

One of the best games of all time. Runs really well in Linux too. Can't recommend it highly enough, simply excellent

Graphics are absolutely beautiful. Gameplay is not over-complicated. Only an hour of real playtime in, but loving it so far.
good
that's my first souls-like game in life, that game is incredible, i will get platinum in this masterpiece 11 of 10,
for the, laptop intel core i3, game optimized very great
Skills check for an old WoW player, but nice updated graphics and an interesting build progression make this game enjoyable to explore and battle through.  I'm interested to see if Souls or BB are also PC available (I haven't searched yet).
I died.
sensational.
Incredible open world fantasy RPG. Probably the best ever made.
One of the best games I've ever played. Not quite like the rest of Souls games (which are too difficult for me), Lore, graphics, fight system - all of them are top notch.
play this game to test you soul and perhaps to see if you have anger issues
Do i need to say how amazing this game is? Like, come on. Pick it up.

Also 69 hours since launch beat game 3 times within this 69 hour period.
Close to 400 hours ,while the game is fun here and there ,esp early to mid game it can become pretty boring .I would give it a positive review if only they knew how to make the quests system better ,not too crowdy but also not in this state ,I mean come one, not everyone has youtube sub.üòÇ

A great game and one of the few that got me to fully complete inside and out minus 2 endings before moving on from it. Super excited for the DLC coming out. Get it on sale, get it full price it doesn't matter it's worth it on all fronts. If you are into souls like games this is the game for you, and even if your not get it on sale it's still a good game. Not overly hard like some other souls like games but not hold your hand easy either.

Propably made for Souls players only. The combat is slow and feel wodden. The graphic is really moderate. HDR dosen't work in borderless mode and there is no calibration in game.

Overall ER is my most favorite game ever since I was born
It's Dark Souls open world. If you haven't played it yet, get to it.
Its been a while since ive been this into a game. It is truely an emersive world and very welcoming to the souls genre
i like swinging big sword
died 10000 times :)
AMAZING game. Just finished my first play through after 94 hours. Wow. Lmao now I gotta do 2 more runs to 100% the game
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Faide montages on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
At least somewhere I can [b]get hugs from a girl[/b].
I wouldn't mind Ranni and Melina to discharge on me icl

stay hard brother
I did not put my foolish ambitions to rest, and now I'm waiting for the Shadow of the Erdtree.
Great game (works well as a first souls-like experience too). Worth the full price, so if you were thinking about trying it, just buy it and give it a go.
buh
Its aight
This game will violate you.
Elden Ring as a game that takes the best elements from previous titles and forges them into something that will go down in history as one of the all-time greats.
elden rinf is there neeed to ssay more
sick innit
First souls game that i have played.  Good combat,good cutscenes,nice story,can't wait for the dlc. Recomended
if you can't pass any obstacle. eradicated them
Not as hard as everyone says but just as fun and addicting as everyone said
O' Greater Will, allow this Tarnished to experience the true release of death.

Nice Game.
I cheated the game by using the mod to prevent loss of runes on death and now the game is one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10 recommend it.
What a game...I am halfway through, but I can say for sure this is one of my top 3 games I ever play. The gameplay, history, quests, monsters and landscapes are breathtaking. The only thing that sucks is the camera and lock-on mechanics with bosses and creatures in general.
Elden Ring is a classical soulslike form FromSoftware Inc.. 
The new focus on open world and more content is amazing, but the difficult is a bit lacking in direct comparison  with the Dark Souls serie.
I have reached 100% achievements on all three platforms that this game is available on. Yes, I have purchased it three separate times. No, there is no cross-save or cross-progression. Greatest game of all time. Elden Ring has essentially spoiled me now and two years later, I can't find anything to compete with it. 101% would recommend,.

After hundreds of hours, multiple playthroughs, and getting every achievement i think its fair to say I like the game. 
I had tried Dark souls before this but i never "got" it. I didnt really understand the mechanics and how everything worked. Elden ring was a much better introduction to the Fromsoft style in my opinion, and once you understand it, it becomes one of the best games ever.
10/10
The best Soul¬¥s like that I ever played and its forever the best

Amazing game good for anyone wanting a challenge or story.
Your life will be more complete as Elden Lord
Still Bullshit
im trying as a heavy melee and it is fkin impossimble I only get angry and have a bad game experience. for example when i try to take any type off boss big healthbar type enemy. but it is a very cool and engaging game, it was worth it to hear Melin offer you an accord. But when you relise that you are not goning to be able to progress in the game if you are a fysikal class and therefore never see melina cutscene again, you get even more angry, so that you also write this type of review
simp for pretty blue lady
I'll get my ass fucked and still get it.

one the best rpg ever
A true master piece and flawless game. I could not recommend this game enough to anyone who has not played it.
This just wasn't for me.  I was never attracted to any other FromSoftware games.  I only decided to purchase and play this because of all the positive reviews.  To use the genre name applied to this game, it feels soulless.  There are scant few NPCs in this open world game.  You have to do a lot of work to figure out the story.  Though, in fairness, the plot is straightforward: become Elden Lord.  But I can't say I cared for any of the NPCs or the story.  The bosses had a threadbare backstory, and it didn't make them interesting nor did it make them sympathetic.  Honestly, why were these people fighting over the Lands Between which are just various flavors of depressing wastelands?

The open world is simply littered with monsters.  There are not any long pauses in fighting.  You better not stand around looking at the wasteland scenery lest you are attacked by roving monstrosities.  I didn't like that my character never felt particularly powerful.  It seems absurd that this peon could become Elden Lord, whatever that means anyway.  After awhile, things became repetitive.

I do give this game credit for an option to exit to the desktop.  That is always appreciated.  But there were scant few accessibility options.  I want to still play games and not experience repetitive stress.  It doesn't seem that hard to offer this accommodation.
Can't say I jived with it as much as I did with DS3, but it is still a rather solid game based on having seen others play through it. As you can see by my hours so far as of this review I didn't play much of it myself but that doesn't stop me from recommending it.
The most difficult and exiting game i ever experienced until now. I've just finish my first run after 100 hours and I wait for the dlc to come.

Have you ever hated a game that you love to play? No? You want to? Then this is the game for you. Its nice to explore until you get absolutely DESTROYED by a random boss. Or get stomped by a low level goblin that you werent expecting.
I rather enjoyed slaying foul beasts and cursed men in the beautiful lands between
 finger
Just absolutely amazing

Most immersive RPG ever. Truly the easiest souls game IMO, but 0 restrictions let you do truly whatever you want, basically whenever you want, with whatever build. The questing and storylines are vague until you get to the middle or end of a quest, but that's to be expected in a real rpg like this. 
Honestly, I can so easily soak hours into this game so greatly immersed without even thinking about it. For the price, it's so easily worth it. The Seamless co-op mod at nexus games is a MUSTTTT (since the co op in normal Eldin Ring isn't very fluid) Truly one of the best RPG's of all time.
My first Soulsbourne game and was easier than I expected it to be, but definitely still hard enough to challenge you. There's definitely some challenging bosses (like Malenia obviously) but was fun and different playstyles are fun as well as most of the weapons are just fun to use especially with some of the unique somber Ashes of War. Very Highly recommend trying it if you like the dark fantasy magic + sword style of game and may have an interest in Soulsbourne games as well it's made by FromSoft so it's pretty much assured to be a good game.
good game
At first I was scared of souls games, but now that I've spend time trying it out fully I falling in love with this genre.
Very Good and interesting game , with deep story , build possibilities and stunning graphics !
this game changed my life.
this game is horrible but fun
this game is so cummy u dont understand omfg
i am addicted
koks
Play this game
joo
fias feet
Its an awesome game I love the cinematic and how the game feels like more of an open world sandbox with goals with how you can get to different parts of the map with ought killing the main bosses especially compared to the other souls games. I LOVE IT :D
Â•ΩÁöÑÊ∏∏Êàè‰ΩøÊàëÁöÑÂ≠òÊ°£ÁàÜÁÇ∏^^
7/10, good game but needs modifications to be truly great.

Other reviews probably have reviewed this to the Deeproot Depths so I just go through some basics for co-operative play.

Here we have "action-fighting" PC game which loses to kids' Hogwarts Legacy what comes to control customization. Nuff' said.

Here we have PC game which competes with Skyrim which one has more arrow blocking meshes.

Here we have PC game from 2022 which looks like something which crawled out of  PlayStation 4.

Here we have game which forces you to play PvP with hikikomori wiki-crafters if you want to play only co-operative mode unless you install modifications.

So, to for all new players I'd recommend before you even start playing:
Install Elden Ring Mod Loader.
Install Seamless Coop.
Install 2K or 4K textures.
Lock PvP hikikomori nerds to colosseum, throw away the key and get VERY LARGE cup to collect all salty hikky-tears. xD
Invite your newbie friends.
Start your playthrough.

9/10 modded.
AMAZING
Can't do anything else but complain. But I still love it.
Best Souls game ever
Fully readup on the game, builds and playstyles before you start for maximum enjoyment.
if you go in blind like i did initially it will get very frustrating.
GOAT
I forgot how long ago I had such a joyful time playing a game as I had while playing Elden Ring. The only game I'd pay double the price for. The amount of content is enormous, the variety in builds/abilities/spells is numerous, the depth and quality of the story and the lore is amazing. This game deserves all the love it receives.

it's PERFECT üëå and that's isn't enough development of games after 2020 bad so much effort for nothing so glad we got souls series keeps getting better and better every season that's rare and it's worth the time and the money 

great thanks to the developer team and studio it's like when god makes a game
Elden Ring is an absolute delight for fans of epic fantasy adventures! From its vast open world to its intricate lore and captivating story, this game is a true masterpiece. The breathtaking landscapes, intricate level design, and challenging combat mechanics create an immersive experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end. With its deep customization options and thrilling boss battles, Elden Ring offers endless opportunities for exploration and discovery. Whether you're a seasoned warrior or new to the genre, Elden Ring will sweep you away on a jolly adventure like no other. Get ready to embark on an epic journey filled with magic, mystery, and boundless excitement!
One of the best games I've played. Crazy excited for the DLC.
Very good game, i like the open world and there is plenty things to do without even going along with the main story.
Give me sixty hours to complete the game and I will spend the first forty being hugged by Fia.

You already know its good. For my fellow braindead normies its okay to google things for help. The game explains things like poop, it's not your fault. But also it is your fault that you suck. We suck. Game good.
Wow this game is perfect

very challenging very immersive
hard as shit, but super fun would recommend
Good game
me an friend spin
game gud
Started with the hero build, 5 hours in I beat Margit and now Im standing at the mist to fight Godrick. So far so good, definitely recommend. Just be prepared to die to the boss a few times before actually beating it, dont give up.
One of the best games I have ever played in my life... period. From the visual aesthetics to music to game play it's some of the best I have experienced. Only negative I can point out is the occasional stutter I endure. Despite the stuttering, I can easily bypass it due to how incredible the game is. 10/10
I usually want to snap my own dick off but this is pretty dang fun even when I get cut down by...an angry red wizard from the underrealm (basement).
Amazing

Yes. Do it
Trash game
If you would like to forget the outside world than this is your game, I bought this game and didn't come upstairs for 1 week. Kids thought I was at work and the wife was convinced I went into a coma. All is well.

PVP is fun but unbalanced; take it with a grain of salt.
PVE is better balanced and fun if you like a challenge; take it with a handful of salt. You have no choice.
This is honestly the worst fucking game i've ever played, i cant believe this dumb ass game got game of the year, its actually wild

amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing..seek the glory

After [b]500+ hours[/b] in the game and with [b]all the achievements unlocked[/b], I can confidently say this is [b]one of the best games I've ever played![/b]

[i]As I'm writing my thesis on gamer culture, I've been really interested in playing, getting to know the community around the theme and theorizing along with fellow players. The environmental storytelling is amazing, the plot is rich - provided by both known information and the lack of it - and integrates the many aspect of jobs and niches of people outside the world of video games (e.g. Tarnished Archeologist). 
While this is unmistakably a FromSoft game, I'd say it's a balanced gateway piece for more casual players, allowing them to discover their own play style while offering help in form of co-op and spirit summons. Also, the struggles and preferences in exploring the world allows one to delve inside their own psyche, finding out more about their inner struggles they've been suppressing IRL, as I've seen in the case of many of my friends and myself. 
It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'd highly recommend giving it a try![/i]

Can't wait for the DLC to drop!

I‚Äôve played a lot of Dark Souls 3 across many systems so when I‚Äôd heard Elden Ring was coming out I thought ‚ÄúHell yea! A new Souls game! aaaand its open world‚Ä¶‚Äù I'm not a fan of open world games. To me, when a non open world game goes OW its about to die. Like a last ditch effort from big game companies. Either way though I pre-ordered it because why not.

Now its been like 2 years since then so I cant tell you what my inital thoughts were other than ‚ÄúHoly fuck this place is beautiful.‚Äù I CAN tell you what I thought by the end of my first play through though. I wanted to go back to Ds3 but every time I did, my mind drifted back to ER and well, I came crawling back. ER has lots to offer. The series would be WILDLY different without it but, it can be improved. At Least for the DLC and mod makers out there.

One thing I think ER has that the other SoulsBornes don't have is deadspace. No not the game. Areas that dont have much other than minor enemies for population and meaningless items for the same reason. There were plenty of times on my first play through where I was exploring places and never gained anything. These places tend to lose my attention and take up my time. They‚Äôre perfect for streamers by giving them chances to talk to chat but they‚Äôre quite useless for the average player.

	As a Ds3 lover, my fav place was the Shaded Castle. Felt like they took a scrapped Ds3 area, boss and all, and put it in ER. The Haligtree was similar but built for ER. Not exactly ‚Äòdeadspace‚Äô but space for a story and items that aren't required but could be useful. Space that you don‚Äôt HAVE to deal with unless you want items which, well that speaks right to a lot of soulsborne players.


So if you're into Soulsborne games, It‚Äôs a must have for your library and it has plenty of challenges so you won't be disappointed.
If you saw the gameplay and became interested, you should 100% give it a try because you‚Äôll love the various builds you can create. My first one was a ‚ÄúDragon Lord‚Äù
If you saw the beautiful world, theres plenty of time for you to embrace it and try to understand the convoluted story of it all. Just dont forget how the other games play in.
Or if you saw its open world, well, you might be disapointed, but im not about to let you leave without trying it. Just throw it on your wishlist for when it gets a discount a few decades from now.


AS FOR PVP. Its been a hot minute for me. I played when it came out and it kinda sucked hard. Like maybe the damage values needed some editing/balancing. As if they were more geared towards PvE. I've been playing Convergence mod+Seamless Co-Op with my buddy and we do some PvP here and there and it feels pretty balanced. Those are Genuine 1v1s though where as invasions will, AS FAR AS I'M AWARE, always be 2v1.
Tread carefully with your PvP experience and report any improvements you can think of. The DLC is supposed to be coming soon so they might be more likely to implement or at least test stuff.
Good game

I love this game, really, 10/10, but dear From Software, if you're willing to make an arena mode like in the other games, could you PLEASE remove the peer-to-peer type connection? It sucks, the hitboxes are worse than DS2, the lag is enormous, sometimes my hits actually deal damage after 5 or 6 seconds, the weapons with status effects build up on me even if I dodge the attacks, and many many more problems (it's not a net problem from me, let this be clear). I am waiting for the DLC and I've played this game's PvE enough, I love it and the PvP is the only thing I can do to keep playing for now, but if this is the result, I'll have to abandon it. Fix the online, From.
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!

Elden Ring is a **masterpiece** that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Its expansive, beautifully crafted world is a joy to explore, filled with intricate details and stunning vistas. The game's combat system is both challenging and rewarding, offering a depth of strategy that is rarely seen in the genre. The narrative is rich and immersive, with complex characters and a lore that keeps you engaged throughout your journey. Elden Ring is not just a game, it's an experience that leaves a lasting impression. It's a testament to the power of creative storytelling and innovative game design. A must-play for any gaming enthusiast!

Great game, only problem is that the Malenia fight is a bit too easy with her self healing being so low and the second phase having so many attacks that are easy to dodge and massive windows for you to damage her.
Played first and completed on PS5 now i'm playing again on PC. One of the very few games that I would consider a Masterpiece. My only nitpicks are that I wish it had 21:9 official support and unlocked frame rate.

The best game I have ever played.
Perfect mix from all of the previous titles. Challenging yes, but very rewarding. Story is also a masterpiece and the game itself is beautiful. Solid game I'd say
Great Game, great frustration

10/10 wish all games put this much effort
Incredible game
Highly recomend this game. first souls like game and im having a absolute blast! looks absololutly gorgous and plays amazing would reccomend for anyone wanting to get into souls like games. Bit of a steep learning curve but once you understand it its not that difficullt besides fighting tough ass bosses.
So, my very late review for Elden Ring: I wish I could reccomend this game to everyone, but I can't. That said, I can't not recommend it either. Is there a neutral review option? My view of this game is that it is great, but it needs refinement. The pros: The boss fights are (mostly) fantastic, the enemy design is great, the ambience is good, the music is good, everything feels (mostly) tough but fair (fuck you raygun lobsters and scarlet rot), and in general the worldbuilding and gameplay in general is amazing. That all said, you might wonder why I don't recommend it? Well, put simply, the quests. I'm sure this has been said to death: this game NEEDS A QUEST LOG. Also, the controller support is stupid.

For controller support: I don't understand why PC games don't have Playstation Controller support. Ridiculous that I need to install a mod just to see playstation glyphs or inputs, so I actually learn the proper controls. Especially when the game is made by a big, rich publisher, THAT ALSO PUT OUT THE GAME ON PLAYSTATION WITH THE CORRECT DISPLAY. You literally made the correct display, for a different platform, why can't you have the playstation controller glyphs as an option for PC???

For those of you that say, "no it doesn't dark souls has never had a quest log!" True. It's also never been open world and had so many questlines that could be broken without warning. The fact that simply heading to Liurnia or killing a specific boss early could end 2, 3, even 4 questlines for people I might not have even met yet, and cut off multiple different endings, is absurd. Also, when you speak to people, they give no indication, many times, where they are going! Good luck finding them again (Hyetta). Even more absurd, there is no warning. We saw this in The Witcher 3, when you collect Ciri, the game will warn you that some quests may be unable to complete. Why is this not a thing in Elden Ring? And the fact that some NPC's (Ranni) will lie about their real name (says she is Renna I believe), tell you that you won't meet again, and then proceed to be one of the most important ones in the game, is fucking baffling. Not only that, but with other questlines (Rya) unless you reload the game, she may not spawn, which also pisses me off. How can you lock her entire quest because "I had a long play session without logging off so she didn't spawn and I missed her quest". I didn't buy this game to spend more time on the damn wiki than in The Lands Between, thank you very much. 

So, will I play this game again? Probably not. Like I said, I won't spend more time on the wiki, reading shit, than playing a game. I also won't buy the DLC, because I have a hard time believing it will be different.

And for those about to "clown emote" my review, here is my suggestion to FromSoft and Bandai: for those of you that don't want a quest log, make it optional. We kind of saw this in AC Odyssey - you could have fully guided quests (markers, you knew where to go the minute you got/progressed a quest), or more vague ones - "go to this location and look around, here's some hints and we recorded them for you in the quest log, then use your cool bird to find stuff." A system like that would work great in this game, in my opinion, and also make it more accessible to newbies.

Consider playing something like Dark Souls before buying this game or else you might get overwhelmed
great game only thing bad about it is the co-op
Masterpiece
AWESOME!
This game has a lot to offer in terms of adventure and diffrent builds and weapons you can use there is probably some weapon you like in this game. The story isnt always inturupting you like in other games you are free to do what you want in this game, i think this game is a 5 out of 5 stars
Best game i've ever played.
It took me about 20 hours to get into the game but this is the most fun I've had gaming since i was a kid
Awesome!

The most expansive and approachable game in the series. Takes a lot of ques from Zelda, but is every bit as challenging and secretive as prior games in the Souls series. Be wary of co-op, as this leads to frequent PVP summon battles. Best played offline for newcomers.
Legendary 10/10
Great game design, world building and fantastic visuals
I'm really bad at this game, but it's pretty good
Best game ever, thank you Miyazaki
best game of all time
  .
This game calls you b**chless, degrades you, calls you worhtless and beats you up countless times. Literally after every cutscene awaits death.

best 60$ i have ever spend
while i do have a lot of problems with this game i have to recommend it.
the open world is spectacular, immersive  and fun to explore.
the story is simply great
and the bosses are for the most part really fun
if you havent played any other souls-games this is a must play
play it, its good YES

It's an extremely fun game with so much to explore. Even if you played through once there is still more things to do. I truly love this game.
Camera controls suck balls and there is WAYYYYY too much fucking reading, theres no tutorial or anything its just gigantic blocks of texts every now and then. Did not enjoy 2/10
Yo soy el elden ring
The best game I have ever played,Elden Ring is an incredible game that is worth playing
dont play this game
good game
I love driving around in my Honda Accord also since nobody will read the reviews, i'll say in this review that i love crossdressing as a femboy
 why cant they do controls better, PC playing is just a pain in the you know what with these absolutely deplorable control system. everything you do seems to be require three different button clicks. opening a map with g really? and no ability to remap anything useful. 
I hate controllers so i'm about to refund for a second time due to this poorly implemented controls for PC players. really Eldin Ring do better, so many great reviews on this game seems no one is playing with a mouse and keyboard. I'm really am tired of these poorly implemented PC ports.
Every good thing you've heard about this game is true. Solid 10/10

best game ever
wowza

best game i've played
Finger but hole
All the more, seek god...
Probably the best Souls genre game ever. This one is a must play. It has a great open world all while keeping a fun and difficult Souls like feel. If you mash up Zelda BOTW with Dark Souls this is what you get. This game has beautifull graphics, very good controller support, a very fun online coop mode and hours of content.
After all the years of training in pain and gain since Dark Souls 1 , 2 ( Easy Souls ) and 3 , Elden Ring is no different for my next new pain since then.

I have been using the same Keyboard bind since DS3.  

But in my honesty , I mostly looking for sick drips armor set or epic weapons along with Story for me to lore listen so I can draw something inspired from this game in future.

I am looking forward to feel another pain again in Shadow of the Erdtree when it finally comes out in 621.
let my time tell u
Elden Ring? Goated. Win. Get this Flippin' game. Cheers
after 170 hours i have finally beaten soldier of godrick
try finger, but hole
Elden King!!
Absolutely one of my favorite games of all time. It wonderfully combines the basic souls-formula with a gorgeous (partially) open world, giving the player a choice in how long the experience will be. 
One might only focus on the main story, and have an experience roughly the same length as Dark Souls 3, while an explorer or quest enthusiast might spend up to 100 hours on a single run. 

The world is absolutely beautiful, and the game runs quite smoothly on a worse than average setup. The story is pretty good, and if one pays a little extra attention to dialogue (and item texts, and does multiple quest-lines, and explores, and...) I'd say the story is REALLY good. Excellent even.

However the biggest flaw in this game is in the way that story is told. As in most soulsborne-games, it can be a bit tedious to piece the whole lore-puzzle together. Especially for players who might play this as their first souls like game. 
Some bosses are repeats with a twist, but most bosses are quite epic & memorable. I'd say this game has probably the best boss fights in the series, together with Sekiro.

Nevertheless, small flaws in a huge machine. Elden Ring really took me by surprise, and I'd honestly say it's my favourite fromsoft game so far! Big up.
great story and the only time a women has touched me.
would love it if they let me use my ultrawide monitor to play the game. legit cant handle the aweful frame tearing
"One Ring to Rule Them All"

Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece, blending intricate world-building, captivating storytelling, and challenging gameplay into a seamless experience. FromSoftware has once again raised the bar for immersive open-world RPGs, offering players a breathtaking landscape to explore, filled with rich lore and jaw-dropping visuals. The freedom to forge your own path, coupled with the deep, rewarding combat system, keeps you engaged for hours on end. And let's not forget the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that elevates every moment of the adventure. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's an unforgettable journey that sets a new standard for the genre.

Great Game 10/10 would get my butt kicked by margit again.
i like it
very gud
dank dank.
Another masterpiece from the originators of the SoulsBourne genre!

This game takes the best, most well-developed, aspects of Dark Souls 3 and refines them even further while adding a whole new dynamic of an open world. This is the best curated and most populated world map I have seen and every corner has something to find, both small and large. The open world contrasts against the dungeon-like areas that follow the more classic Dark Souls gauntlet.

New or returning player, you will enjoy this one.
Its elden ring.
Let's get the negative out of the way first.  The mini-dungeons (caves/mines/catacombs/etc) are of dubious quality.  There are a few very good ones, but many that feel very repetitive.  Cutting most of them would've made the game even better, by playing to its strengths.

But that's about it.  I love everything else.  The world design is wonderful in fromsoft fashion.  They've adapted to the open world well - I always preferred the DS1-style world, that's still their best work, but this is great.  It's got the haunting/beautiful combination down pat, though the overall tone is a bit lighter.

I'm not very good at these games, but I've played them to death anyway, because the gameplay/combat is just so fun, even if you kinda suck.  There are a few new mechanics to help out a bit - you can always summon help for bosses or certain other encounters, even offline; invasions are way toned down; and there's something you can access early on to gain levels quickly when you're underpowered [discover it on your own, I was shocked/thrilled when I did!  but by now it's in guides if you need em].  All this combined makes it a bit more accessible, but it's still very satisfying and challenging.

And no, I still haven't beaten malenia.
big bongo bum
As of writing this I have played 161 hours,but haven't actually beaten the game yet. Not for the reasons you probably think I could have beaten the game a long time ago,but I keep getting distracted cause I'll sometimes find a item that has a cool ability,and want to make a whole build around it. I keep restarting to try out new classes, or new special weapons that give me some idea to make a cool build around. Theory crafting,and exploration are probably the two biggest selling points of this game.

One reason why I keep coming back to Elden Ring,and this is probably my biggest selling point. Elden Ring is the only game I know of so far that tells the story the way it does. What I'm saying is it has a unique way of telling the story of elden ring. It does so by the environment itself. The world of elden ring will tell its story in a very unique way that no other game provides as far as I've seen.
Even though I haven't beaten the game,and know the ending there multiple endings,but I have put in this many hours into a game I haven't even beaten yet, so I got my moneys worth. Plus the characters,and world of elden ring are pretty amazing,and I'm not a Dark Souls fan, I didn't enjoy the Dark Souls games,but Elden Ring is good imo.
What can you say it is Elden Ring and as a noob to darksouls games, I found this game a grind at first but am starting to see the appeal.
no
Amazing game, hard but amazing
good ass game
amazing expirience
its a master piece, nothing else needs to be said.
Gud game
no
only played for a little bit 10/10
i tried finger but hole
I just got done beating Rahdahn and fighting him reminded me of the bitch Rennala. Rennala made my the angriest I have been at a game. She would spam her bullshit magic and then summon in a bunch of the stupidest shit I have ever seen. The only time I could hit her is when she spawned in the wolves and then I would run back out of range of her magic. I did this for 30 minutes fuck this boss. Overall though very great game I just needed to vent that I hate that bitch.

Just finished the game and I only came back to say fuck you Rennala again. I still fucking hate her and this will never change. Stupidest boss fight of my fucking life. The next time I buy another one of these games im playing mage so I can not get fucked by other mages.

good game
Best game I've played in a long time, and this is coming from an old codger who enjoyed Dark Souls as well.
get this game
can't wait to be maidenless again..... wait
So fun.
Dog
This game is just awesome! The gameplay feels great, combat is really good, the lore is just as cool as every FromSoftware game, and exploration is the best. [b] I really recommend [/b] it for everyone(if never played a souls-like game now you're up to a challenge).
Before playing this one, Dark Souls 3 was really my favorite, but Elden Ring inevitably took its place. So allow yourself to immerse in it and have fun!
One of the best games I have ever played in my life. Elden Ring is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It is challenging but also very rewarding. Very few games justify the markup price of $60, however, Elden Ring is so good I would pay $120 for it. If you have never played a souls-borne game, do yourself a favor and buy this. DLC is coming up so now is the best time to get into the vast open world of Elden Ring.
so good üëèüëè so good badabuyuhuhuhu WAAA
fun if you are strong or good good for cordanatin
fun game if you feel like losing your sanity
I've rejected all Souls games until this one then one day I found myself doing a Malenia no damage video. It's just that good. Dont miss out on this gloomy dark fantasy game.
masterpiece
ITs elden ring
Foul Tarnished!
Another awesome addition FromSoftware in the Soul's games genre.
I think that at the moment is the most ambition the developer have created and it feels great. In terms of difficulty, I don't think is the most difficult, as most of the bosses you can create another copy of yourself and overwhelm the boss in most of the cases. If you want a game where you can immerse yourself, this is a great option.
peak
amazzz
it good.
Too much content
Playt it.
Good
One of my favorite games of all time. What I would give to play it again for the first time.
I want to kiss fromsoft on their big ol' lips, while kicking them in the balls.
Playing this game is like an abusive relationship

Trap chest
it was good. if you never played a from software game it can be tough but once it all clicks the game is very addicting. dont give up if you get frustrated just give it a little time and you will be hooked. game also looks great
better then expected
Simply, if you want to get into darksouls and you enjoy coming back to things like "damn this boss is too hard for me right now guess i'll just go explore more and come back" then i recommend this greatly, unless you instead just want to continue throw self at a brick wall then you should probs just play the darksouls games. Its not like you cant play this game, its just that you probs would have a better time there then here.

This game is open world which I personally don't usually enjoy, but elden ring always has something around the corner and they have an arrow to at least give you vague direction for you to go to for continuing the main story. I have not beatin this game and I bet 80 hours if i ever get to that point, I would only be half way through.

Originally I played this game like a year ago for about 3 hours and just didnt find it to be as good as I hoped, but I came back around and damn I was missing out. Though I guess its also because I'm on a monster hunter low right now, but hey this game at least can fill the monster slaying hole until 2025.
420 hours and still not bored

A masterpiece. 

It's very simple. If you are a souls fan, spend your money on Elden Ring.
Without question the best RPG of the decade. FromSoftware are masters of their craft. This will only become better with the DLC's release.
Well, I can't say no
yu
great game cant wait for the next game from, fromsoft.
I love fromsoft and you will too play all their stuff big W.

fun game to play and grind
This is possibly the best game I have ever played. There is a steep learning curve to the game and if this is your first Fromsoft game you will have a rough time until you become comfortable with the mechanics. If you try this game the best advice I can give is to explore and if something is to hard, mark it on your map and come back later. I have gone from dying to simple soldier enemies all the time to being able to kill major bosses with ease by my second playthrough. I keep restarting and coming back to this game and making new characters, It's such a thrill to play.
One of the best games I've ever played. I can't recommend it enough.
What a game !!

This is the first FromSoft game i managed to beat, after struggling to get hooked to Dark Souls (especially #1). 
I think it's a great starting point, because it keeps some From Soft things (the demanding gameplay, be willing to learn from mistakes, some boss design rules etc ...) but with a more accessible gameplay (summons, rune farming, sneak, craft ...)  (Tho i should wait until i beat previous Dark Souls before saying that ... I will)
So if you never managed to play a FromSoft game but always wanted to, i recommand starting with this one
With some precautions tho - the game is big, really big. I spent 80h, but i'm sure i could have spend 30 more hours, there's plenty of dungeons i didn't explore etc ... 

There's obviously some flaws coming with such a ambitious wide design, some (a lot) of bosses are reused, which isn't too much of an issue imho, but it's something to be aware of. A lot of dungeons are pretty much copy pasted, but once again, you don't have to do them all, except if you want every piece of loot. 

Some boss fight are frustrating : duo boss fights sucks imho, and there's a few of them. Some attacks seem a bit unfair etc ..., but overall, it's really an enjoyable journey. Just be ready to use everything the game gives you, because the game won't hold back, for the best and the worst. 
There's a lot of different builds available, and the game makes respecing quite accessible, which is great, because you can respec for one boss if you struggle too much. Some boss also suffer from awful camera placement (most dragons for instance). But overall, they are good, some are trully great.

A lot of weapons, but every cool weapons is locked behind magic stats, which kinda sucks if you want to play with a pure melee fighter, because you won't get to use 90% of the loot. 
Armour is mostly for fashion, which isn't a bad thing imho (there's already plenty of things to manage), except that a lot of armours really don't match together, especially because of very different metal tints. 
 
The biggest strenght of the game is the world design. Gorgeous ! Some places are simply breathtaking, and it shows that a lot of care was put into it. If you enjoy fantasy worlds, this one is great ! A lot of inspiration from different things (Berserk obviously, this is a From Soft game) but other things too !

The story is kinda cryptic like From Soft usually does, but i enjoyed it. I'll be watching lore videos about it so i can get the whole picture ! NPCs writting is a bit lazy tho. Like, i don't mind having cryptic things and etc, but a lot of them seems almost parodic. Sidequests kinda share the same flaws, you will probably need to read a guide to finish them, but some are great !

Overall i think Elden Ring is a great experience, i think their goal was to make a more accessible game without making too much compromise, and i think they achieved that in a very impressive way. If you are a knowledgable player of previous From Soft games, you might get rebuted by the flaws i mentionned ; because of the size of the game, it can't be such a polished experience as previous games. The size is a strenght and a flaw.
I'm definitely looking forward the DLC which seem to be massive !
GREAT GAME

Game is darn expensive for sure but it is worth your time and buck still waiting on the dlc but when it does comes out will purchase it without hesitation. 100/10
My beloved <3
My most played game on steam and probably my favorite game of all time.
eglenring
Try finger
EDIT: is a game worth playing, very fun mechanics, has some internal coherence issues and suffers from a copypasted style. Being fully honest I only felt invested half my first playthrough, then I just went through the motions for the sake of completion, but the story in itself boasts of grandiousness while being kind of shallow at the same time. My main issues are: 1- I don't care about the Lands Between and the explanations about why its conflicts haven't been solved until we arrive feel very flimsy, I mean a VERY big stretch. 2- The open world is beautiful but is a diservice to the classic progression system the Souls games have (and viceversa).

A very good game, excellent in the areas Fromsoft always is, but I won't blame you if you feel is overhyped.

The long rant:


[h1] YES - but with caution [/h1]

[h3] PROS: [/h3]
[list]
    [*]It is [b] BY FAR [/b] the most forgiving Fromsoft game ever. Ashes of war, cooperative open world, cheese locations, explore get stronger and come back. Yes, it is unforgiving, but it gives you tons of tools to get over tough spots.
    [*]The open world is gorgeous.
    [*]Weapons variety with their movesets is very good, but suffers for it though.
    [*]Ashes of war (equippable weapon abilities) is by far the part I most enjoy, they keep the combat feeling fresh.
    [*]Sinergy between temporary effects, statuses, attack types, buffs and debuffs is deep and expertly crafted, but it also suffers from this.
    [*]Armors. They're beatiful as always, and there's variety as always.
    [*]Varied enemy gallery that keeps you on your toes with their different movesets, elemental affinities and weaknesses.
    [*]Incantations are varied and feel super satisfying to cast.
[/list]


[h3] CONS: [/h3]
[list]
    [*]The lock-on targeting system really, I mean [b] REALLY [/b] needs a rework. It is super inconsistent to the point it will [b] NOT [/b] target a guy that's directly in front of you but will target a guy that's behind a wall and a flight of stairs 30+ mts away from you. The lock-on system has killed me more than enemies by straight on deviating a precise hit or making me walk to a precipice (Dragon's Dogma would never do that to me).
    [*]Stamina management is very good and I enjoy it, but considering special moves also consume FP, would you Fromsoft [b] AT LEAST [/b] not give me that much delay between attach chains?? I mean animations look cool but damage is only registered in a segment of it, rest of the time I'm open for attacks (that have way more reach than me even using the same weapon btw) so 0.2sec is [b] A LOT [/b] of time, enough to get rekt. Also, why can't I chain an attack with a roll if I have stamina?
    [*]Boss weapons, some are awesome but most are... Disappointingly lame. Gargoyle weapons suck 4$$, Crystal weapons are extremely lame. I can undertsnd not being able to apply Ashes of War, but why can't I infuse the non-affinity types with some with an element?
    [*]Sorceries are a tricky point: power does not outweight the fact that they're all some variation of "blue light goes *bling*".  Sorry Fromsoft but terribly uninspired and not satisfying at all.
    [*]Crystallian gear and sorceries do what again???? Oh never mind, they're sligtly cooler looking than some other armaments/sorceries. For real??? What a terribly missed oportunity.
    [*]Flame Monk Curved Sword is so dificcult to farm and has 0 special traits that is a complete disappointment, alongside Black/Flame Monk attire, like why the heck do they not give you a slight boost maybe in casting fire/black fire incantations? Or have the black flame incantation effect last longer in Flame Monk's armaments, or make Black Flame stronger with the full set and weapon but weaken your Magick/Holy damage output/resistance..??? Not the only case in which there are missed opportunities: Hoslow's full set should give you a slight higher evade window (since Juno is so mobile), Diallos' mask should give you decreased DEX but increase damage resist while using the Noble shield (since Diallos is weaker than Juno which makes him dependent on his shield). Marais mask shouls give you a slightly faster attack rate with Regalia of Eochaid or Marais Executioner Sword (ok I'm stretching it but you get my point: we have to farm specifically for things that are not specially rewarding).
    [*]Why the horrible downgrade to the Serpent Hunter greatspear outside the Rykard arena????????? Yeah yeah, don't give me the super bombastic wind blasting spear ability but man... that super slow SHORT RANGE attack??? Of course is very effective if you level STR but it for sure does not feel satisfying to use. At all. Horrible downgrade.
    [*]Weapon range unbalanced AF. Enemies using your same weapon and ability will have longer reach than you. Some enemies have their damage dealing window last longer than the attack itself: I can roll and avoid the first imapct and then roll again to avoid the explosion/AOE but for some reason I'm getting rekt even when enemy attack is over..? Why? Because otherwise you'll be OP..? Bro, strong enemies can still pretty much one shot me and I still can beat the crap out of weaker enemies, no need for the reach to be that unbalanced. Weak point here.
    [*]Overly repeated boss reuse. The only situation in which is ok to do it is Margit/Morgott, Mohg the Omen/Lord of Blood, the Crucible Knights, and the Ancient Hero of Zamor because is a piece of storytelling. I'm not talking about field bosses, but actual Bosses.
    [*]I understand the "dead world" scenario Fromsoft always depicts but this isn't supposed to be one as the story goes, but a world in the *process* of dying. Melina herself would ask you (if you accept the Frenzied Flame) why destroy everything if life keeps on being born, which makes no sense since everyone is either a raging zombie, a zombie soldier, a sad-sits-in-its-place zombie, a zombie boss, a demigod, a quest giver or a tarnished; no life being born at all. It is a dead world, but is inconsistent with what NPCs tell us. Love you Fromsoft but weak point here.
    [*]Weird framerate drops even at ultra low resolution (thought it was that but apparently nope)
    [*]Weird crashes while trying to connect to multiplayer (mostly collosseum but open world too
    [*]Music is good but not particularly inspired. Only one memorable song and that's the main theme.
    [*]I don't care about any of the main characters or main points of conflict, they are "cool" but I really don'r care about being the Elden Lord or feel any satisfaction about having a hand in the Lands Between's "destiny" because the story itself lets you know very clearly that the outer gods and all of the other gods just switch supremacy every milennia or so. That with the fact that I am super weak and only lucky to win any combat makes me doubt on the mental capacity of any of the main characters and that is because, sadly, Fromsoft has fallen in the formula spamming coil. It is a game with an overall expert craftmanship, but lacks the depth and coherence the Dark Souls series has.
[/list]


[h2] CONCLUSION: [/h2]
Definitely worth playing, lots of mindless fun to have specially playing with friends.

What can I say, its Elden Ring.  I decided to get it on the PC in preparation for the expansion.  I already have it for the PS5.  It is beautiful and just a great game.  But it is frustrating that I have to restart my computer every time I play it.  For some reason it crashes to desktop after the first time I play each time.  Its annoying, I have looked up fixes for it and only thing I came up with is switching off the card switching and use only the G card.  Anyone know of anything else that might work.  I have an I9 with a 4080 laptop.  So anyhelp would be great!
The game itself is good, if we are talking about gameplay, but in terms of everything else, it is subpar, as are all Bandai Namco games for PC. A single game crash lost me all the progress I made(for all the fanatics who rave about this game and only play from soft games, not everyone has time to sink in hundreds of hours into all games.)

SO CLEAN. SO GOOD
As my first souls game i absolutely adore it sm, i love the challenges that come with it. Highly recommend it as someone who has never played a game like elden ring.
not fan of bloodborn games or soul likes games, but I Really enjoyed playing elden. recommend for those who want to experience nightmares xD
Don't fight the tree sentinel first up.
I liked it.
Not for the faint of heart

Realmente es un juego de mucha calidad, te hace sentir ganas de explorar constantemente, y los gr√°ficos son asombrosos. la historia es incre√≠ble.
First Souls game beaten. It made me want to play the rest.
good game

like if cum had gameplay
You died.
Good game.
play it
As someone who is not a fan of single player games, this is one of my favorite games. I'm glad I gave it a try. This game grabs your interest and makes it hard to leave. You encounter a boss or enemy that is hard and you won't leave until you beat it. Once you beat it, the feeling you get keeps you playing. The graphics are beautiful and I have only encountered a single bug which is amazing to think about. Don't let the difficulty keep you from playing, once you understand the game and its mechanics, it is not too bad!
Solid game but be ready to get sucked in for long playing time!
love it
best game ever
This game is very deserving of game of the year and i would say its 10/10 but i would never wish this mental torture on anyone else
I was initially turned off by getting brutally slaughtered almost at the beginning of the game. But I got smart and found the tutorials and wikis of all those brave Elden Ring pioneers. Since then I am good and truly addicted. There is so much content from a rich culture to seemingly endless combinations of builds.
came in 3 secons
good
big hammer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"BEAR WITNESS"
its alright
lol it ok


woulds buy again
I am only saying yes as Peru might sink into the ocean if I don't. Now I consider myself an avid fan of difficult games (If I do say so myself). Fallout 2? A breeze. Wow Classic, no sweat. However, Elden Ring was found on the ninth floor of Dante's Inferno, chained to the pulsating nut sack of Satan himself. The amount of pure, unbridled punishment this game puts you through for the hairy snatch of a medieval peasant woman is unprecedented. 

make it to the overworld? smashed to death by giant horse man, sneak pass that? smashed to death by camp full of random people, figure out what to do with all the cryptic Shakespearean mubo-jumbo they ram down your throat for Americans to feel cultured? Smashed to death by giant falling from sky. 

I have returned on multiple occasions as I have always felt like I just never gave the game the good ol' college try, just to have my dick so firmly placed inside my ass by every mob I come across that unless I have some sweaty no-lifer dragging me through the game, I don't stand a chance.

For what it is worth it is a very pretty game, just not my cup of tea.

4/10 I enjoy grass to much.
you are given the equivilant of a stick then tasked to fight god. . . . .10/10 would play
Good game love game
Yeah, it's good
VERT
Melania is to others what the Fire Giant is to me.
Best Game! So much diversity of play styles. Never gets boring and always enjoyable to play. My favorite game by far also DLC comes soon so get it while you can before the DLC drops!!!
I first started Elden Ring in 2022 and just finally finished this game to completion ahead of the DLC dropping and all of the time spent playing this has been enjoyed. Highly recommend, game is a masterpiece and after hundreds of hours of playing you will still find new things. 10/10
As an avid gamer who revels in immersive worlds and challenging gameplay, Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. FromSoftware has once again proven their mastery in crafting captivating experiences that transcend mere gaming.

From the moment I stepped into the Lands Between, I was entranced by its sprawling landscapes, rich lore, and haunting beauty. The sense of discovery is unparalleled; every corner holds secrets waiting to be unearthed, every vista a breathtaking testament to the game's meticulous design.

The gameplay mechanics are both familiar and innovative, seamlessly blending the punishing difficulty of Soulsborne titles with the freedom and exploration of an open-world RPG. Combat is a delicate dance of strategy and skill, rewarding patience and precision while punishing recklessness. Mastering each encounter feels like a triumph of both intellect and reflexes.

But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its narrative depth and world-building. FromSoftware has crafted a mythos so intricately woven that every character, every piece of dialogue, every item holds significance. The lore is not spoon-fed; it's there for those willing to delve deep, adding layers of meaning to every action and decision.

And let's not forget the mounted combat ‚Äì a game-changer that adds a new dimension to exploration and combat. Galloping across the vast expanse of the Lands Between, engaging in epic battles atop majestic steeds, is an experience that will stay with me long after the credits roll.
Big Sword Good Game
everythings good only fire giant this absolute mf is the flaw of the games by himself
One of my favorite games of all time; played for hours on Xbox and just got the PC version for Shadow of the Erdtree. I never thought I would enjoy a Souls-type game and frequently stayed away. It was after my friends convinced me to play I realized I could play so much more than just FPS. If you are hesitant, I would say give it 10 hours, it is a slow starting game. Just enjoy the atmosphere and try to find cool things. 
For those who might be curious since I ask everyone else, my builds have been:
- Poison/Scarlet Rot dual spears (I know, I know...)
- Madness
- executioner sword (I know, another meta...)
- Celebrant's rib rake
- Crossbow/Black bow
and am currently trying a thorn build on PC
Gud
How do I leave Limgrave?
Came for the elden and i am hoping to leave with the ring. It is difficult and i die a lot but i feel accomplished after doing almost any thing.
,;=;e
best game
It Good
really fun but constant stitching issues and frame drops
genuine masterpiece of a game 10/10
Yes I like the game. Put an option to romance some furry guy or something.

10/10
I've lost count of how many times I have completed this game, and I still love it every single playthrough.
cant wait for dlc

good game

I was a foolish tarnished now I‚Äôm an Elden Lord. Thank you again fromsoftware for making a masterpiece.
best Lords of the Fallen copy I have ever played
The lack of any ability besides actually getting banned and ending up on a server for the banished to play without anti cheat is truly disappointing and it is a lazy design choice at this point that it has not been addressed. If you don't want to play with mods and potential cheaters then don't, if you don't care then you should be able to just turn it off. It's all about consent and choice lmao. Anyways, besides that negative disclaimer everything else here is golden, it's a supersized Dark Souls with it's own unique identity that sets it apart from the rest. It really does feel like they took every lesson learned from previous titles, scrubbed most of the bad and kept most of the good and then improved upon it as a whole. Did you perhaps really appreciate the consumable and environment based system from Demon's Souls? That's a completely viable play style here or you could ignore it completely and go for the more predictable (in terms of PVP) Dark Souls model. You can even go ham on an aggression build, and while you won't fully get something as satisfying as Bloodborne it's more than you can pull off in any of the other like titles. The lore is going to take you a long time to wrap your head around even if you are an avid reader. This game does not give you a story that makes sense until you speak to everyone and read every item description and even then it's based on the context of your choices and individual perceptions. You almost have to collaborate with other peoples experiences to get a full picture, much like Dark Souls but bigger. It scratches that itch, being a massive game, one of the largest ever successfully developed but filled with zero fetch quests or pointless content, it's all interesting and not at all repetitive. Everything has a point and a purpose and it is astonishingly impressive that they pulled that off within a semi non linear world. The Witcher 3 did this 2nd best and it's still full of time wasting errands that are just there to inflate the amount of time you spend with the game. The graphics are top notch, the game play is great if you like souls games, the magic system is very much expanded but not at all required, the story is an enigma and it's your job to decipher it and share your findings, the sound design and music are in my opinion 2nd only to Bloodborne, the replayability is an art itself and it's perfect here. Need I say more? In a world where supposed AAA devs are ripping people off left and right this game is worth way more than the listed price. You'll be at it for years and you won't regret a minute, well except for mistakes that you can only really blame on yourself.
Elden ring is as good as hitting a fent cart. 1 2 buckly my shoe, skibidi rizz
The game is absolutely insane aye
Yes 10/10 Everything, recommend this
GOOD GAME RECCOMEND HIGHLY
GOAT
This game has made me want to die over, and over, and over, and over. Great game though. Some of the best visuals ever, shame it has black bars on Ultra wide by default though.
So real talk Im really bad at dark souls, like i can barely get past the first boss sometimes. This game was a bit different for me , largely because I used summons. But I played through the game like 3 times and im doing so again right before the new dlc drops. Its just so good that I can go anywhere to fight any boss or just explore if i want. That  and some of the songs are amazing. I love playing this game and I will play more when the dlc drops
VERY GOOD, BEST GAME I PLAYED SO FAR
veri gud veri najs

My Friend said it would be easy; I already died in the title screen
best game
its like dark souls 3 if dark souls 3 was elden ring
PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT
MIXED NUTS
very elden very ring very nice
super fun in multiplayer
good
I recommend this for everyone who has the time to explore this game to the fullest and spend the time needed to make the game worth buying. As a big fan of the DS franchise aswell as BB and in general Souls-like games i was very disappointed about the greater game design but specially the boss design. There are a few bosses that seem like they received the same love every DS boss received. But then there is a ton  of bosses who seem to be made with the idea "from software games must be hard so the bosses must be annoying and just spamming attacks because we dont have the time to spend the time needed to make a challenging boss." If this game would have had two more years in development and world building it could have been what it seemingly wanted to be, a darksouls similar game but with an open world. But it was released with bad bosses who are very repetitive, have no complexity in their move set and just spam their attacks. Nothing to learn about, no way to get into most of their move sets because their are no gaps to find its just dodge dodge dodge hit  and so on. The open world is incredibly empty but the dungeons and castles you do find are fun to play through and the bosses you find are fun if you find and fight one of them for the first time. My personal problem with the game is the strong push towards playing magic builds. As someone who loves it to wield a big sword or axe and wear cool looking armor this game is less enjoyable. The run i have where i build strength was very exhausting and no fun at all. The magic focused run was way easier especially with the bosses but still not what i look for in a souls-like. If you like open world games with a lot to explore and fun challenging areas this is a game you might have fun with but be warned about the boss fights they are less fun than most other games from this genre.
.
may chaos take the world.
Very Good Game
Best Game.

This game is amazing, but i warn you, if you don't buy and download it right at this moment, I will strangle you in you sleep and then chop your body into little pieces, which I will feed to your mother without she knowing.
genuinely a good game i liked it so i have 114 hours on it. ummm difficult boss fights but after you kill one you are very satisfied and then carry on playing until you fight another difficult boss and you want to die again so umm yeah play if you like that its good
hard as f*** but still good
10/10, goated
Definetly hard but when you beat that one boss it is just satisfaction. Pure satisfaction.
i love being constantly traumatized, i dont even have a second to breathe to pop a flash i recommend playing the game very enjoyable

I want more hugs from Fia :(
good game one of the best
aight ok so the graphics arent as good as people say and being locked to 60fps is cringe (yes it matters) but game is aight
This is a perfect piece of art
The game, is visually pleasing, with a rich combat gameplay. 
It may be expensive, but the cost is all worth it, for this masterpiece.

Very nice
Painfully Awesome
old jewelry
shit fire
the game you should play before you die
ez
first ever souls game, definitely scratched my hyperfixation craving just right, most fun ive had since minecraft came out
mmeldem rimg üóø
amazing

Good game
die
Best game of the All-Known universe.
good

YES VERY GOOD SEKIRO IS HARDER BUT THIS IS GOOD WELL DONE NICE VERY FUN BOSS FIGHTS AND AWESOME WEAPONS, BUILDS AND LORE  :D
The Best Game that ever came out! Shout out to Dark Soul games cant forget them,they are the reason this game exists. But on the real note this game has so many life-quality improvements that the dark souls game don't have plus the availability in play styles is unlimited.
awesome game, was challenging but now its ez, 10/10 game.
Worth the money and the time, one of the best games I've ever played
I haven't been interested in playing any AAA or console games for the past 15 years. One day, my friend lent me this game, and the following day, I made the purchase. First time in 15 years. And after 70+ hours of gameplay, I know now why this is the 2022 best game of the year.
great
me likey a lot. It's mucho fun.
Im bad at this game
This is a "Dark Souls" kind of game aka you die a lot. The multiplayer is clunky, but it was a design choice to get you thinking about the "fingers" in the lore more. There is no way to compare a merchant's equipment to the (up to three sets at the same time) equipped gear. 

I stuck with it enough to make it through a cave and travel across a large section of the map (Spoiler: I got to the "roundtable" map location). I am not sure if it is worth playing based on the QOL approach that the devs have taken to this thing.

There isn't much that I am spoiling if you have gone through the tutorial, so I am going to just say "Things I wish I knew when I started":
1) "runes" are coins that enemies drop when killed and they are auto collected. "XXX runes" are items that you collect where XXX is any adjective. Note that the coins you have drop when you die and despawn if you die again before picking them up. Note that items stay with you forever. This was explained like 3 times but the fact that the exact same word is the noun between those two made me still think I was going to lose my "golden rune", "smithing rune", etc. whenever I died.
2) the way to make any in-game progression is to either
 - grind to get "good" by dying several times memorizing boss and creature "tells" on what they will do next
 - grind to get "overleveled" by rune-coin farming and spending the coins on levels. (you kill stuff, auto collect rune-coins, touch "respawn point" to revive all enemies, rinse repeat) then buy level stat upgrades.
 - partially cheese any boss by using either "summon spirit ashes" or "multiplayer summon online player" to help you defeat the local boss then your helper despawns
 - get better gear, but all the merchants have "tutorial level gear", so make due and progress the game in other ways via grinding THEN access areas with better gear?
3) You need to "touch grass" often. Substantially all enemies respawn when you "touch grass" aka the respawn "touch grace light" locations. Also substantially all enemies respawn when you die and respawn. Unless you "fast travel" to a "touch grass" point, you will spend your time "grinding" to just travel unless you get the horse.
4) Spoiler: you get the horse by touching 3 unique grasses (not in dungeon) then [EDIT] visit the first location (a church's grass) at night or by dying and respawning at that first church's grass.
Spoiler: you get the spirit bell to summon "spirit ashes" by [EDIT] having the horse and wating at least 1 day where you ride the horse then visiting the first church's grass at night or dying and respawning at the first church's ashes.
5) Multiplayer messages and "blood stains" showing deaths are the only predictable interactions with players. This gives info about "be cautious" or secrets.

Based on all the info i have gotten from the game, Its UX is going to be clunkier regarding QOL and I don't want to spend my time doing grinding to be able to hit "bigger things" with my tutorial sword.
Difficult at first, many secrets, deep gameplay. I recommend to play online. Amazing mood, lore and exquisite crafted world.
this game wildin
Makes me incredibly irate, my blood pressure and heart rate definitely rise while playing. Good game design and beautiful boss fights and scenery. 10/10 waiting for DLC while I finish a play through.
like it good yup
Good game
First time ever playing massive open world game... Fromsoft Does not disappoint.
bought it by accident reimbursed the damn thing and the money whent into the abyss (didn¬¥t get the money back)
Play this game. It was Game of the Year in 2022 for a reason.
this i shte  bnest game i mve playe in hy intier life
Malenia Blade of Miquella :STEAMHEARTEYES:
YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER GAme
thanks miyazaki i rate it a poison swamp out of ten
Its fun and easy, a little too easy though...
good time
this game has taken over my life
this is it
one of the best games of all time, seriously. play it.
elden ring is almost a perfect game. and i just reached level 713 and maxed out all my stats i can say this game is amazing and play it. and if you complain that you keep dying then just learn from that and get better.
You can't even put into words this absolute masterpiece of an experience. Just play it, I'm ashamed to have not played it sooner. Play your style, your game, your experience. Do you, because this is a game for you. Thank you Elden Ring
this is what a perfect game looks like
extremely hard but just skill issue
i 100% achievements twice on xbox and pc and this is the best game ive ever played 

didn't have fun 10/10
Alright, gather round, fellow casual gamers, for the epic tale of my journey through Elden Ring. Spoiler alert: it was like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. In other words, it was an absolute circus.

First off, let's talk about character creation. I spent a good hour tweaking my avatar's nose length, only to realise later that in the grand scheme of things, it didn't matter because my face was going to be hidden behind a helmet 99% of the time. Thanks for letting me agonise over nostril size, FromSoftware.

Then there's the combat. Oh boy, the combat. I swung my sword like a toddler flailing at a pi√±ata, hoping for some sweet loot to fall out. But instead, I got a swift kick in the teeth from a skeletal knight who probably chuckled at my feeble attempts. And don't even get me started on the dodge mechanic‚ÄîI dodged right into more trouble than I dodged out of. It's like my character had a death wish.

Exploration? Yeah, that was a laugh. I set out to conquer the vast open world of Elden Ring, only to find myself lost in the woods faster than Hansel and Gretel on a sugar rush. Every time I thought I was making progress, a giant monster or a gang of bandits would pop out of nowhere and remind me that I was just a puny mortal in a world of pain.

Oh, and let's not forget the story. I'm sure it's deep and meaningful, with layers upon layers of lore waiting to be uncovered. But honestly, I was too busy trying not to get skewered by a dragon to pay attention to the intricacies of the plot. Call me when there's a "Casual Gamer" difficulty setting that comes with a CliffsNotes version of the storyline.

But you know what? Despite all the frustration, Elden Ring somehow managed to keep me coming back for more punishment. Maybe it's the gorgeous landscapes, or the adrenaline rush of finally taking down a boss after a hundred failed attempts. Or maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. Either way, Elden Ring gets a solid 10 out of 10 for making me feel simultaneously triumphant and utterly incompetent. It's a special kind of masochism, and I can't get enough of it.
Elden Ring was a great game to play through. Plenty of fun all round, good combat system. Only thing I would complain about is the game not being cross platform but besides that Fromsoftware delivered an amazing game and I can't wait to play the other souls games.
√â o melhor jogo que eu j√° joguei. :D
I have 150 hours on my main character and I still haven't finished the game
My friend got me this as a gift and let me say that he very well may know me better than i do becuase i thought i would not enjoy Elden Ring. Boy, was i wrong.
Good game to co op at the start when learning the ropes.
Malenia my beloved

game good men happy
yes
A masterpiece, hard and complex game but if you give in the time it will be a once in a lifetime experience.
funny number
Waifu Ranni. :P
Game of the Century
i usually play fps games and i fell in love with elden ring. 10/10
goat
Great environment and animations. The quintessential polished game.
Really good game, even though i am terrible at it
Elden Ring is the best video game ever made

open world full of colors with a grim tale, hard but fun and rewarding. tons of things to do and explore.
shit is church
Its a game
i LOVE ELDEN RING.
Another masterpiece from fromsoft. Ds3 is my fav tho
Gam 2 ez 4 me
the graphics was something else, along with the mission itself. its a game you can lose yourself in quickly
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. Wtf are you waiting for? Buy it
i hate it
Its fantastic. You just get absorbed into the game
As much as I enjoy it, Easy Anti Cheat literally ruins my games performance so I'm basically forced to play offline at this point
Edit: Wasnt EAC but def didnt help. After disabling something in my device manager it runs alr again. Still leaving negative bc between that and how bad pvp and bosses feel compared to previous games id prob not realistically recommend this over any of the dark souls.
stan
soooo goood
I'm going to pot
I became maidenless
Such a great game! 10/10
:)
good
Good game with pretty good replayability
Pretty good - 8/10

Best open world exploration game I've ever played. It's challenging but extremely rewarding.
Dodge and weave then wail on something a bit while dying 100 times isn't exactly a fun, engaging combat cycle, nor does it lend itself to emergent combat mechanics; neither does the flat, entirely damage-scaling leveling system which clearly would do Dark Souls games better if it didn't exist in the first place and they just put more capacities into armor and weapons based on what I've seen and heard of other Souls games.

Those who say this game is amazing, for everything I've encountered, are delusional if they think this game is perfect, or even worthy of high praise. I've gone as far as Stormveil. The encounters and stealth are by far the only both good and fun design here, and the encounters so far are done nearly perfectly if not perfectly, but that's certainly an aspect low in priority over the base of the game itself.

Don't praise something just because you personally enjoyed it. Praise what is worthy of praise, and boo what is worthy of booing. Or do you care so little about creator's welfare that you'd rather tell them a lie so they can go on to make mediocre creations, let alone your own when you tell lazy megacorporations "I'll pay 60 USD full price for garbage, and praise it too!"

Am making a mod to fix the combat. Enjoy the pointless grinding and lifewasting without it with unfulfilling skill that doesn't transfer between different enemies and bosses. Was fun dying a million times to Tree Sentinel until I realized it's just pointless grinding and lifewasting with unfulfilling and unsatisfying skill that doesn't transfer between different enemies and bosses. Game is irredeemable without mods, but even the mods fall short of perfect, so I'll do it myself.
yes
it's open world dark souls, what's not to like.
i mean, what a game.
The open world is feels bland and repetitive, with barely any incentive to stray off the path, because there's not much to see. There are also many enemies with attacks that seem cheesy and unavoidable, which leads to some deaths feeling cheap and not deserved. Still, awesome music and awesome combat. The build variety is insane, so very replayable. Start with Dark Souls, then Sekiro, then this.
Elden Ring is a godly game. I just suck at it. Steam wouldn't refund it to me. Idc I had the game for 2 years and played for 10 hours I want my 70 dollars back assholes.
Darksouls but brighter
Decent game
love

Everyone in this game is so nice and friendly ^-^
Ye
Try fingers
but hole
Game is as goog as Sekiro
I like big sword üëç
This is a great game, but many people quit on the first boss. If you do get stuck, leave and gear up before returning.
This game is best 60 dollars ivers spent
#


good game fun if you have the mod with friends
This game is a jank mess and a perfect example of why open world games are the worst thing gaming ever came up with. You're presented with the option to explore everything, but that's not what they want you to do, they have a clearly defined path they want you to follow. The game is gated behind mechanics you aren't told about till you progress through these railroaded paths, even after they go out of their way to create a tutorial area to highlight how the game works. That this game is lauded so highly while being so sub par in presentation, and the fact that you can't suggest these are bad without people who bashed their head against a wall to figure out how the game operated and then the subsequent hoard of people that read their guide and will act haughty about how they didn't have a problem with figuring it out will bury you for suggesting that this game hallmarks the declining interest in quality of a game over how the community needs something to rally around and anything that has a large budget and doesn't have Ubisoft/EA/etc. stamped on it has to be better.
great all round

Best masochism game ever!!!
fucked by a man on a horse, big dragon decided i wasnt allowed to live. woman hugged me, ranni would get it 

other than that its pretty good
best game ever!
If you like FromSoft, you'll love this. 

I played BB first, then Sekiro, then Dark Souls 3, and now this. All amazing, but this one has sunk it's tooth and nail into me deep. Love this game. Exploration fits the FromSoft genre like a Hunter fits a dream.
good :) AND AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
My frustration hit stack overflow and now I no longer get angry at videogames. Thanks, Fromsoft!
YOU DIED......................................

You will se this a lot so be prepared to die in this game as it is a really hard game.You might be thinking its not that bad but its actually that bad.The graphics are amazing the combat is good ,the items ,the exploring ,the bosses.Everything you might want from a souls-like game is here.You can choose from variety of classes and some of them start with really good weapons its up to you to choose,the world of ELDEN RING awaits you!
For the PvP mode in the game i didnt really encounter a lot of players in my world also known as "invaders" their objective is to defeat you. But you have these "PvP Colosseums from which you can start a PvP based match from 1 player to 6 or 8 in total (NOT SURE). 
But the builds in this game are crazy coming from Frost,Bleed,Poison builds and many more you can always decide what to play and have a lot of fun!
The game is worth the money BUT you will get frustrated a lot! Enjoy :) .
dlc where
A great game with a HUGE map that takes a long time to explore and unlock, Ive had a blast making a mage pvp build and strenght build, Only thing i would say thats negative is that the game can be confusing at points. 
Confusing on where to find stuff to unlock new areas and alot of buttons to learn, I would give this game a 8/10 ( took a break after reaching final boss)
Elden Ring is not worth $60
Finally played and beat the game. Game of the year material for sure. Game play was great, graphics great, and overall had a great time playing.
ITS A SUPER SOULS GAAME.

YOU CAN JUMP!!
Literally one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life, if not actually the best. The entire world is massive and it's genuinely hard to go somewhere without finding something new on the first two or three playthroughs. The only big downside is the repeated bosses but given the scale there's no way every single boss could be unique
the game hates you

horrible way too many glitches for a game this old, dlc coming out and glitches are every corner
Eldemn Rimng
This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest game I have ever played and I can genuinely say that this is a game that almost anyone can find a way to enjoy. 

For context, I'm usually a big FPS, BR, racing, and sports game person (anything with sustained action has me locked in). I had heard of and looked slightly into Elden Ring when it first released and even watched my sister play some of it, but it didn't seem like my taste. About a year later, my girlfriend and our mutual friend started playing it and suggested that I give it a try. I told them bluntly, "I don't know if I'm going to play it. It looks kinda boring in my opinion." They urged me to buy it and if I didn't like it, to return it and get my money back. Elden Ring then proceeded to death grip me and became the only game I played consistently since. 

In almost every conceivable way, Elden Ring is nearly the textbook definition of perfection. The story, albeit very difficult to grasp without looking up a breakdown of it online, is deep and rich. The open worldness of the game lets you pick your own progression path, and generally allows you to get any items you want at any time (except for progression locked areas like Mountaintop of the Giants, Consecrated Snowfield, Crumbling Farum Azula, and the Haligtree). There is a massive number of different types of items to utilize throughout the game, and creates an amazing opportunity to try different character builds across different playthroughs. 
Most importantly, the game play itself is a chef's kiss. I went into Elden Ring thinking I could beat the ever living piss out of everything and tank most hits with minimal consequence, and I was dead wrong. This game challenges and forces you learn how to play it, and its learning curve is steep at times, but is largely enjoyable and engaging from early game through to end game. But at every single point, it is satisfying to look back on the bosses and sections of the game that seemed impossible but now are a cake walk.

From being a person who thought they were going to hate Elden Ring to someone who considers it their favorite game of all time, I highly suggest everyone to give Elden Ring a try. You could always return it within two hours if you end up not liking it... (but in some way, I guarantee you will)

Still don't get FromSoftware's storytelling and world building. But pretty much everything else in the game is amazing
I didn't kneel

I'd suck the rot out of malenia's toes. Godrick is my self-insert.
As someone new to souls-like games, Elden Ring is probably the reason I'll buy more.

This was my first experience with a souls-like game and I think I started from the top. So, when I started the game for the first time, they showed me a short cutscene and just put me into the game with no specific missions, no journal, no characters around me except for one dude who literally told me to get some maidens. There is no indication on where to go and what to do. So, you know, you just start walking around and in front of you is a knight that is 5 times bigger than you and if he notices you, he one shots you. 

Anyway, after walking around and exploring I started to get some weapons, runes etc. but still have no idea what to do. So, I did the only thing I could do, just started riding the horse around the place and found myself in Caelid, which is the Australia of Elden Ring. And that wasn't a fun experience because, again, there is no indication on where you can go and where you should go-avoid. So you only know where you shouldn't be after getting eaten by dogs that are 4x your size.

Jokes aside, I usually try to go everywhere in games, explore every detail so that I don't miss out on stuff but in Elden Ring, that is very hard to do. So I always had this feeling that I am missing content. After playing for about 35-40 hours I started watching-reading some guides so that I don't completely miss out on important stuff and this being my first souls-like game, it helped. So, if you like souls-like games, just go on this journey without looking at anything but for me, playing with a guide was actually really fun. I played the game on a 1440p monitor with max settings with a 4090 and graphics are out of this world, so often, I stopped to take pictures or just look at the views because the game is looking gorgeous. I mean, what else to say, one of the best games ever created both gameplay and graphics wise. Story is also good but not having journals or mission descriptions can make you forget some of the parts of the story but I suppose that's just how these games are. What a great journey this was
gud game
Embrace the pain. Become Elden lord. There's a magic Lady with four arms what more could you ask for?
YES
Elden Ring is currently by far the best souls-like in almost any way. I'll spare the praise as many others already did and just mention the only complains I have to not call it a perfect game. But this is complaining on a very high level.

1. There are way too many caves and catacombs. I mean that this feels repetitive from level design to boss variety. It feels like the department for items, ash of war and spells was outperforming the level design department and they just said, " screw this, we copy and paste from now on to include all that crap". fewer but better caves and catacombs would have been the much better choice in my opinion.
2. ER is lacking the dense atmosphere of former Fromsoft games. I know I shouldn‚Äôt compare it to Dark Souls as ER is its own thing. But I miss the thrill of desperately looking for the next bonfire and feeling the relief when finally activating it. This mostly only applies to the open world and is caused by design.

I still would say 10/10 (or 9.9/10 if you want)

.
There is not much to say besides that this is easily one of the greatest games of ALL time, and that's coming from someone who's never played a souls game until now. They do not make games like this anymore. This is 100% a generational title. DO NOT MISS OUT!
Has crab and prawn. Never met someone who likes crab and prawn that I cant trust
gang
This game is not good, but it's not bad either. I still had good times playing it.

The combat is similar to the Dark Souls series, which is fine, but there are still some clunky controls present, such as input queueing, input delays, and certain unnecessary animations that can't be canceled to roll.

Camera still suck, it's nightmare when you fight the big bosses or in tight room, your camera will be your biggest enemy because you can't see things. The lock-on feature can maybe worse, if it lock-on legs or hand of big bosses when they attacking, the camera will spin a lot and made me dizzy.

The world in Elden Ring is beautiful and has great world-building. The graphics may not be good, but the game has a great art style that makes the world look stunning. They have created a large map, but it lacks enough content. There are many similar dungeons with slightly different layouts, filled with enemies that we have already encountered countless times. At the end of these dungeons, we often encounter the same bosses with fewer movesets and your reward most of the times is shit-tier items you never use. 

They don't even bother adding a journal for players to keep track of their next moves. You will find yourself looking for a wiki or YouTube a lot to find out your next move, which is bad. The side quests are even worse. The NPC who gives you the quest may give you a hint about where they're going or which item you'll need, but most of the time they just don't. It's not a big problem in previous titles because the map is small or even linear, so you can just play the game and still stumble upon them by chance. But in ER, the map is so large, it's very hard to keep track on quest, it's very to miss or ruined the entire quest.

FromSoftware is the best when it comes to creating boss fights. There are 238 bosses in this game, which is quite unbelievable. However, most of them are either copy-pasted or trash mobs that appear later in the game. I can only count about 20 bosses that are worth mentioning. They have very good designs but BS because their spamming of AOE moves, infinite stamina, huge hitboxes, absurd damage and long combos. 

The final boss is the worst final boss FS has ever made. Radagon is fine; he's challenging but still fair. However, the Elden Beast is an extremely frustrating fight. It unnecessarily long the battle because most of the time I can't even touch the creature. Whenever I get close, it teleports to another side of the map and relentlessly spams homing spells at you. What makes it even worse is that you don't even have Torrent with you, which is BS. And if you die, you have to find Radagon all over again. Have fun with that. 

It may seem like I really hate this game because I've complained a lot. But to be honest, it's a great game to play, and I still recommend everyone to at least try it once. This is the first time FromSoftware has made an open-world game, and they did a very good job. However, it still has a lot of flaws. I hope they will take a look at them and fix them if they decide to make another game like Elden Ring.
Miyazaki you've done it again
Bat. Chest.
Easy game, try demon souls if you want more fun
it good
- not enough morgott's feet 
- can't sex the blue 4 arms lady
- caelid
- godskin Noble gives the term "Body horror" a new meaning
+ U can find village of the albinaurics by googling "Elden ring Albania"
+ Tomboy mentioned
+ Fia is the only person that offered to hug me ever
+ They literaly call you maidenless
+ Fingers.
ok fine. i like this gamne ok
Kinda like Dark Souls but bigger and longer.
game worst then dark souls 3 and for being a supposed dark souls 3 clone successor that is saying a lot
Try finger but hole
This game crray cray
Best game of all time
I suck a lot but game is pretty
it's elden ring.
Easier than Darksoul but fast like Sekiro, best game !!!
I didn't hear no bell
Big sword go bonk
Yes
Soldier of God, Rick is the hardest boss
gg

This game is too easy. It's perfect. What would really send it to GOAT status is if it were actually hard. Like Ninja Gaiden, Contra, TMNT on NES levels of hard. Miyazaki, please do better.
this game is very fun but you will eventually encounter the fire giant and godskin duo
caelid sucks
Ok, so I never played a souls-like game until Elden Ring. But I'm sure glad I got it. The graphics are up their with the best, the gameplay is fairly intuitive, the difficulty is hard enough to provide a challenge, but easy enough to enjoy. It runs pretty well, I have a fairly old PC by modern standards (RTX 2060). It's probably the best game for beginning your journey onto the souls-like genre. You can absolutely sink hours into it, making it, in my opinion, absolutely worth the asking price, and more.
its fun and oddly addicting
Best story game I've ever played :)
Literally the best game ever made
Best Game Ever
pope turtle approved
from the time i first felt the touch of a souls game I knew this would be no different I went in with a clean slate and open mind and was absolutely blown. As always the game butt fucked me in the ass raw style(as i like it) and was amazing, anger inducing fun! p.s. I personally made it my goal to get anything i can use to produce fire cause I'm in fact a pyromaniac. :>
good
The absolute best option for an into to the soulsborne genre, with phenomenal combat, exploration, story, and a beautiful world to explore. The difficulty is far more forgiving than any other fromsoft game, and the game is incredibly well polished. 

Some of the late game bosses feel blatantly unfair and bullshit,  but the sheer number of easy ways to cheese them if they get too annoying cuts back on that pretty quick. The game is balanced around the idea of using summons and calling other players to help you,  By the time they become a problem you have to deal with, you'll be able to manage well enough.
"Elden Ring" is not just a game; it's an odyssey, a journey into a meticulously crafted world that challenges and captivates in equal measure. From the visionary minds at FromSoftware, creators of the acclaimed Souls series, and the masterful storytelling of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin comes a gaming experience that sets new standards for the medium.

At its heart, "Elden Ring" is about exploration and discovery. The Lands Between, a vast and interconnected realm, invites players to chart their own course through its sprawling landscapes, each more breathtaking and perilous than the last. Whether traversing dense forests, scaling treacherous mountains, or delving into the depths of forgotten ruins, every step is a testament to the game's unparalleled world design.

But it's not just the world itself that mesmerizes; it's the stories it holds. "Elden Ring" weaves a rich tapestry of lore and mythology, drawing players into a narrative that is as enigmatic as it is compelling. From ancient legends to tragic histories, every character, every location, every encounter is steeped in significance, waiting to be uncovered by those brave enough to seek them out.

Of course, no discussion of "Elden Ring" would be complete without mentioning its challenging yet deeply satisfying gameplay. Combat is a ballet of steel and sorcery, demanding precision, timing, and strategy. From epic clashes against towering bosses to tense skirmishes with cunning adversaries, every encounter is a test of skill and perseverance, rewarding those who dare to face its trials head-on.

Yet perhaps what truly sets "Elden Ring" apart is its sense of freedom. Unlike many open-world games, it doesn't just give players a vast playground to explore; it gives them agency, allowing them to shape their own destiny within its world. Whether forging alliances with powerful factions, uncovering hidden secrets, or forging legendary weapons, every choice carries weight, every action has consequences.

In the end, "Elden Ring" is more than just a video game; it's an experience, a testament to the power of storytelling, world-building, and interactive entertainment. It challenges, it inspires, it enraptures, leaving an indelible mark on all who dare to venture into its world. For anyone seeking an adventure unlike any other, "Elden Ring" is a must-play masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.
its elden ring
what do i even need to write ? fromsoftware ,souls game .
pretty cool,
Best Fromsoftware game to date.
I played this modded and was cheating. The only thought I had was *This must suck playing legitimately*
awesome
Late to the party, was my first Soulslike but got me hooked really quick. BotW open world and dungeons vibes. Looking forward to the DLC!
An amazing game that exceeded all of my expectations. Building off the DNA of their previous games (not Dark souls 2, everyone knows and agrees that that game is utter putrid garbage) Miyazaki integrated an open-world aspect to make an enormous world that I found myself lost in. The design for the art, combat, and enemies were also incredible as all of Miyazaki's games are (with the exception of the cheap imitation of a Miyazaki game known as Darksouls 2, which was made without him).  

TLDR: Dark souls 3 meets Skyrim, amazing game, 10/10.
godskin duo and waterfowl dance.
flasks are somewhat outdated, as in the souls game you had a shit ton of time to use them. Now? it's a risk even glancing at your R key.
other than that? yeah, get it if you're into soulsborne/soulslike. (the difference is staggering, surely) Probably the best souls game to start with, as it's (in my opinion) easier than the rest. Whole lot of area to explore, with a ton of lore, and plenty of weapons/spells/incantations. Plenty of replayability. Also, some advice: Don't use YouTube build guides. By all means, use YouTube or the fan wiki to find where to go, or where to find things. But your build should be your own.
Go forth, Tarnished, and claim the Elden Ring.
GREAT GAME!!!!
best game to play while you wait for the Elden Ring DLC
fun
Annoying game but thats what makes it amazing
gwn goeie ja toch
What else can I say, this game was worth the money and the time, don't think twice about buying this game, go for it !
Fromsoft delivering another banger.
10/10
Great Game
Gud
gud game

live die repeat
very very good
Good game, I am bad at it.
good lore
Best Game since ds3
its good
One of the greatest fromsoft games to date I recommend anyone to give this game a try just once
Best game I ever played hands down
For me, best game to debut the fromsoftware
YES. OH yes
cool
Best game I have ever played
Big weapon good, swing swing
–∏–º–±–∞
excellent game, 100% guaranty
peak
Best game ever played
Greatest game of all time.
gud
If you like souls like games you will love this game. In my opinion very good game with open world.
it is so painful just because i suck at the game but is still fun

Achei f√°cil
Best game ever
I mean duh? Get it. It's the last big developer that hasn't completely sold out.
i like poo
try finger,
but hole
i like it

great game, Astel sucksüëç
MASTERPIECE
very fun and beating stuff make my monkey brain happy


ALSO there is lots of fun things you can do on multiplayer like challenge your build vs your friends

Stunning art direction, heart-pumping combat, great (and unconventionally told) story, beautiful music. Worse than Ds1, cus no sexy spider boss
I hate my life

Hell YEAH!
Maidenless behavior is the best behavior
It's the most rewarding series in gaming.

It's obtuse on purpose; don't feel ashamed to use a guide or walkthrough.

Eventually, you'll learn that it's not your character that levels up, it's you.

The combat is a dance, and like regular dancing, you have to learn your steps, and feel the rythym.
If you wanna know what it feels like to be raped to death, play this game.
Game is ok. Minus because I cant play offline.
Elden Ring is life. I am hopelessly  addicted to this game. Need shadow of  the erdtree pumped into my veins.
pogo
It does not have 21:9 support. Even weirder, my game boots in 21:9 with no black bars but after like 10 seconds the game remembers that it "should have" black bars and they pop in... so weird, so frustrating that it mocks me showing that it could/it has 21:9 built in but then it just goes neeaahh..
beat malenia
try fingers bum
10/10 Game, I just wished I picked it up 2 years earlier
i cannot sleep at night anymore
really good game
the real elden ring was the friends we made along the way.
I got called maidenless but then I married this hot blue witch with 4 arms and then she gave me this cool sword. Overall 11/10
Very nice not hard at all..
In short: A major improvement over Dark Souls 1 and 2 in terms of gameplay (haven't played the rest). The open world aspect is kind of boring, but not enough to make me mad. Story is still mostly whatever but at least respects your time which I can appreciate as usual. The post-processing is a fucking abomination.

In more details:
Gameplay:
+faster everything, less of a snooze-fest
+a lot of efforts made to break away from the series' well-known monotone roll-stab-roll-stab, shield-stab-shield-stab one-on-one is-it-my-turn-yet fights
.....a strong focus on group fights, both one-vs-many and many-vs-many, naturally bringing variety and tension in fights and rewarding agressivity
.....lots of enemies now designed to make you use a variety of defensive maneuvers in a single fight, trying to make you switch between dodging, running away, ducking, jumping, circling around, blocking, parrying, or stunning the opponent
.....more meaningful variety in attacks too, with guard counters to spice up sword-and-board gameplay and jumping attacks or charged attacks as high-risk high-reward moves to stun enemies and open them up for further punishment
.....very interesting ashes of war system that allows the customization of one attack as well as the stats of every basic weapon and creates an incentive for switching between one-handed and two-handed weapon handling mid-battle
.....mounted battle
+pvp truly optional
+monsters' physical and elemental resistances actually somewhat important, yet another incentive to switch up your gameplay
+much more difficult, but still very reasonable difficulty

-still impossible to pause the game, even with multiplayer being now optional
-still long-ass useless 'you died' screen to waste your time, especially during pseudo-multiplayer when you're invading npcs
-a lot of damage sponges

World:
The open world nature of the game creates a lot of downtime during exploration that you may or may not like. It also features some of the most blatant copy-pasting that I've ever seen in my life in big productions. I don't particularly mind it, but it is certainly noteworthy. You'll see the same rooms, the same rock formations, the same elevator shafts... dozens of times each.

Graphics:
I honestly think that the artists that have worked on this game must be mad about their art director. The decors, characters and animations aren't outstanding, but they're certainly very nice. Miles better than anything I could produce of course, and well worth the probable dozens of millions invested to make them. So where was the need to throw it all down the drain with all that unbearable post-processing? If you were to play it vanilla, you'd see the game's beautiful artwork through the lens of: at least four layers of blurring (anti-aliasing, motion blur, depth of field, chromatic aberration), at least three ways of fucking up the lighting (vignette, auto-exposure, lens flare), ridiculously strong color filters and a thick layer of volumetric fog. It makes me think of those face-blurring filters that you have on tv to protect people's anonymity. Trying one's hardest to turn a normal image into an incomprehensible smudge on the screen. Obviously one's hardest is a bit of an exaggeration here since it's just enabling a few checkboxes on your game engine, but still, I can't play this game vanilla for more than ten minutes without hurting my eyes. I'm not joking. A blurry mess, flashes of blinding lights and deep darkness randomly alternating every few seconds and a view distance of ten meters. That is the shocking reality of vanilla Elden Ring graphics.
I suppose all modern AAA games are like that by default, but I wouldn't know because 1. I don't play that many AAA games, 2. In the vast majority of those games, you can disable those stupid effects. But here you can't. Or well, you can't except for depth of field and motion blur, which is already something I guess. I couldn't bear it so I played the game modded to remove whatever effect I could, and you certainly should do the same. Honestly, if I didn't know that you can alleviate that problem through mods, I wouldn't recommend the game based on that point alone as it is absolutely unacceptable.
1st of all, I have beaten this game on PS side (all bosses) so don't mind the gameplay time.

ELDEN R√ñNG. Been playing this since beta test and gotta say this is a mixed bag if something. It's beautiful to watch and listen to (I was mesmerized of the main theme for a long time) but sadly, the gameplay - or the way this game makes you play is a letdown. I mean the diversity of player builds, There are a few builds that absolutely bulldozer the whole game, so the so-called freedom is not there; literally you take a spear, infuse it with bleed, take a shield and that's it. - you are nigh-invincible. Congrats, feel free to kill everything. The game even MAKES you do this, because some of the bosses are full of one-shot killing gimmicks, especially that one.... you know, THE one. I played over 100 hours and then I had to change my whole build to beat her. Yes, I  know it's a SKILL issue also, because I kinda suck at souls-likes, even though I have beaten DARK SOULS 3 several times and some others I won't list here. 

After changing my build the little rest of the game was easy-peasy and so on.. the point being it's an OK game to beat - ONCE.

Later, I bought this game again (momentary lapse of reason), this time for PC. It was kinda nice at first, looks better than on PS and yadda-yadda... then I realized, after ten or so hours... this is absolute crock. This game is an absolute Bore after the first "round". Co-op is boring, bosses are boring, everything feels like a chore and the list goes on and on...

I won't be buying the DLC, I won't be playing this anymore. so guess I just don't like ER. I understand people who love this game, the lore is interesting, and like I said it's a beautiful game to watch and listen to. Sadly the most important thing, the actual game, is just hollow. DARK SOULS 3 is a masterpiece, ER is: Put a ring on it - and divorce after the honeymoon. That is the ELDEN R√ñNG. Thank you, waiting for ELDEN Shop.
One of the greatest games ever made but it now
GOTY
$100 is cheap for a masterpiece such as this.
I'm an older gamer (61) and I usually don't stick to this kind of game for very long. I typically get frustrated when I die over and over again fighting a boss but for some reason it doesn't bother me now (well, mostly). After 425 hours the game is still fun for me and it gets my blood pumping. Elden Ring was very well developed at the time of its release and it's just an awesome game.
fun
Very well-made game! Love the graphics, the countless options of how to play the game, and definitely the bosses!!! 10/10. 
(Playing it on PC and I still think that it's definitely playable + good !)
Even tho i dont like these sorts of games and i suck at them i do find elden ring to be a really cool game ngl but the community is pretty terrible

Best story translate
All is best
Amazing.
definitely the best souls game
The goal is to bring ruin to everything after hundreds of hours of hard work. Level vigor to succeed.
It's a souls game if you like dark souls or the like your gonna love this game
If God had written a story. This would be the ring from the hand
bagus tp susah

Funny game, haha.
fun :D
Beat the game for the first time after about 113 h of playtime and only this "soon", because I felt like I shouldn't continue searching every nook and cranny to see everything and find every hidden item or place this game has to offer. And there is a lot this game has to offer besides the main story path.

Elden Ring is my first Fromsoft game, and it got me hooked, even though I usually don't like dying over and over again. 
But this game isn't unfair. It offers so many possibilities to play it and make it easier for yourself, if you do wish so. 
And even if you die a lot, you probably learned something from it. I still remember how it made me feel to finally beat the Tree Sentinel at the start of the game, after dying to it over and over again and almost losing hope, but not quite wanting to give up. It was truly exciting and invigorating to finally defeat it.

If that doesn't sound like an experience you want to go through, then maybe the game really just isn't for you. It doesn't hold your hand, platforming can get incredibly annoying at times, NPC questlines can be easily screwed up and sometimes there's this moment, when you stand in front of a certain lake of rot and just wish to go home. 
But there are also those moments, when your heart is loudly beating in your chest, as you see the sliver of health left on one of the bosses, you died to quite a lot already. And then you finally beat it. 

I love the freedom this game provides. There are so many places to discover, so many builds to choose from, so many enemies you can confront, but most of the time don't even have to, if you don't feel like it. 
The world of Elden Ring is vast, beautiful and cruel, harboring interesting characters, be it NPCs or Bosses.

This game was made to be fun and it shows.
Mint!
I swear I almost smashed my PC to pieces and nuked someone's house but except for that it's a rly good game‚ò∫Ô∏è
very good funni boss game with good funni endings and good funni fighting.
I am the great Kenneth Haight, and I have seen quite enough!
Dark Souls but open world and with mommy Malenia.

What else do you need?
elden ring!!!
TL;DR: great solo experience, and 1v1 PVP. Co-op is lacking (at least unmodded - big up Seamless Coop person/ team) and forget about team PVP with friends VS other teams.

Everything you would expect from a FromSoftware game. Engaging boss fights, breathtaking vistas, cryptic lore, satisfying combat mechanics. 
Add to that the dissapointing afterthought that has historically been multiplayer in these games. We get an arena, but no clear way to team up vs others. As a result anything but dueling is dead. Great.

One point:
There are many ways to simplify/trivialize PvE by a significant amount (broken builds, bleed everything, npc phantoms, the comet). It is up to the player to create their difficulty setting. Would be nice to have more options that make the game harder as well (there is only currently a talisman that increases damage taken by the player afaik)
Literally the best RPG I've ever played. At first I couldn't get into it because it was too hard and frustrating and I hadn't played a souls-like before. After coming back to it and persisting I'm blown away by the amount of effort and polish in this game.

10/10
i mean its alright
love this game i hate pladusaxx tho can someone explain how to dodge his teleporting attacks like osmetimes i can but sometimes i cant but love the open world part of the game gives you diffrent options to do because of this i might just get dark souls remasted when it goes on sale
crazy that this was made in rpg maker
Watching my friend Mila fight Death Rite Bord. It had [-----------------] this much health left and she was good on her health bar. The bord did this energy blast and she f*cking died. MILA. DIED. She was doing so well and SHE DIED! So now here I am writing this negative review. Note: Please don't take this review seriously. I'm so high rn. Like really COOKED. I'm pretty sure this review won't be published because all reviews are reviewed by someone/something and they choose to approve or not. I hope whoever reads this is laughing and I made their day. I don't want to get banned from Steam please. ;~;
Want to know what if felt like getting branded with a red hot iron as a 12th century criminal? Play Elden Ring.
Alot of fun to be had with this game when you start to understand it!
W
hit with a fast one when they do the wind up
It's okay
Incredible game which should be a must play for everyone. However, sadly it seems that the developers only spent about 5 minutes balancing the game, cause the late game enemies will almost all OHK you, some bosses have moves which are not possible to reliably dodge (malenia: waterfowl dance, elden beast: elden stars) and some builds are way too strong (bleed, sorcery).

Overall: 9/10
fun game
One of the best games I have ever played.
Won for a reason. DLC about to go hard with how muhc is being cooked

'
kinda good game
I was taking a shit then got invaded or some shit

Top 3 favorite game of all-time. Don't hesitate, just buy it and enjoy!
Elden Ring is an achievement in game development. Among FromSoft's catalog of excellent games, it stands as the pinnacle of everything they've done thus far. Few games come close to Elden Ring in the value that it provides: a sprawling open world to explore, some of the most creative enemy and boss designs ever put in a game, engaging combat, intriguing lore and unique worldbuilding, and so, so much replay value. There's so many different builds you can create that fundamentally change how combat feels and you approach the game. For example, here's a quick rundown of how different my builds have been between playthroughs: 

1st. Colossal Sword & Greatshield - A Strength heavy build meant to tank damage and hit hard. This is basically the character I've been playing since Dark Souls 1. Looking back, it's a slow and cautious way to play the game, and I was missing out on so much by sticking with that build. 
2nd. Sorceries & Cold - My first Magic build. Create distance, and use spells to deal damage and buff yourself. This was the first time I truly melted a boss. Comet Azur and Terra Magica is a brutal combo. While you can hit enemies from far away, you're more fragile without the strong defense of a shield. 
3rd. Dexterity & Bleed - Getting close and cutting quickly with katanas is everything. Unlike my strength build, I have no shield to protect me; I have only my dodge to rely on. This has been my favorite playthrough so far because the fights feel more intense, but I've been blasting through the game like never before.

I already have plans for at least two more builds I want to play through the game with (Faith build, then Dragon Knight). With each time through the game, I've found more and more things I've missed each time. It makes me realize how truly massive Elden Ring is, and I still enjoy the game as much after 220 hours as I did after just 5. You will get your money's worth out of this game. In a market saturated with unoriginal and boring products, this is a wise purchase indeed.
when the dlc was announced I had child support due, and I had to chose one or the other... I will let you guess which one I got
pretty gooooooood

One of the most boring games I have ever had the DISPLEASURE of playing.
best game ever
GOAT Nuff Said
     1,000 hours later, I think it's finally time I gave my thoughts on this game. I've been meaning to do this for a long, long time but my opinions on the game kept changing, not changing, and everything in between. I've done dozens upon dozens of playthroughs for the other souls game and this one is no different in that regard but it's also been by far the most polarizing to me out of all them. To tell you the truth, another reason why I held off on doing this was because I know how much people love this game, how much hype there is surrounding it, and I didn't want to be seen as that guy that just wants to rain on someone's parade. I also didn't feel like getting spammed with the usual "git gud" garbage but I guess you could say my playtime has given me the confidence I needed to finally put my thoughts out there. You could also say that this is just as much my own personal story with Elden Ring as it is a review of it.

     I played Elden Ring a month after it came out and I'm gonna be blunt, I was not impressed by the end of my first playthrough. I didn't hate it but it was definitely my least favorite out of all the other games. I was so disappointed with my enjoyment of the game that I replayed the other games to see if I was missing something or being too harsh on the game or anything like that. I played Sekiro for the first time and fell in love with it almost immediately. I did SL1 runs of the whole trilogy to see the bosses were really as well designed as I remembered (they were). Once I was done with all that, I went back and tried a couple of different builds in Elden Ring. I really tried to break down what it was that didn't click with me. I was trying really hard to understand why I was replaying every boss in Sekiro multiple times just for fun while I couldn't be bothered to fight half of the bosses in Elden Ring again after beating them the first time.

     If I were to sit here and talk about every single problem I have with this game, this shit would damn near turn into a novel so I'm gonna try to condense it as best I can. I didn't have any problems with the open world mechanics but I found the world, the lore, and the story to be far less interesting then it's predecessors. I loved the wide variety of builds with the spells and ashes of war but hated the balancing and how many of the magic types were so barebones to the point of being nonexistent (I can feel my blood pressure rising just thinking about bubble spells). I didn't like how the game felt too easy with spirit ashes but also didn't like how annoying the game was without them. I was frustrated with the performance of the game and how it always kinda ran like shit despite never being outright unplayable. I absolutely despised that no matter how good I got at fighting the bosses (getting into no hit territory), they never reached the fun level of Bloodborne, Sekiro, or DS3. Like I said, I could on and on about all the little shit for hours but I doubt anyone would care that much.

     I need to make this clear, I never hated Elden Ring. I would never have gone through 1,000 hours if I outright hated it. In fact, I think one of the biggest reasons why I kept playing it so damn much was because I was trying to find that magic that everyone else was experiencing without even trying. I eventually resorted to mods (some of them even made by me) to try and just fix the problems myself. Some were more fun then others but I eventually realized that I was just setting myself up for disappointment. It's around this time that I started to change my philosophy a little. If the other games were As to high Bs for me in terms of enjoyment then I wanted to try get Elden Ring up to a B- as opposed to the C- it currently sat at with me. I accepted that Elden Ring's just never going to be my favorite but I still wanted to at least be comfortable where I stand with the game.

     I wish I could describe some magical moment where everything just clicked and it instantly became my favorite game but the truth is that it was more of a soft click then a hard click. Over time, I either made my peace with or found workarounds for a lot of the things that bugged me, I grew to appreciate some of improvements Elden Ring made from it's predecessors, and I kept making more and more memories with the game. I was able to do so many things in Elden Ring with my OCs (ones that I've had as far back as Demon Souls) that I just straight up could not do in any of the other games. I lost my dad, almost lost my mom, and went through the darkest period of depression and anxiety I've ever felt and there's no denying that Elden Ring helped pull me through that time period. My opinion of the game has come a long way since my first playthrough and I think I'm finally up to that B- I mentioned earlier. It's not even close to being my favorite souls game, I still stand by all of the problems I have with the game, but I'd be lying if I told you that I regretted all the hours I spent on this game.
If only I had a bigger, but hole
10/10
Just finished my first playthrough. Pretty good but a bit too easy for me
More ways to play than Dark Souls however, the boss quality is lower. VERY fun to play with friends
i recommend if you want to get your elden ringed
A game for one with lots of patience and willingness to keep at something, the game will kick your butt for the first three quarters but it gets smoother towards the end, also the fire giant is terrible....you have been warned.
It's perfect.
Fun game if you had an abusive dad or step dad. Thanks Miyazaki
Excellent game, world, game play, all good
123 hours played, done nothing, still fun.

No fornite collab shit game
 i only almost broke my hand playing this
I already had the platinum for the game on PS5 and wanted to do it again so I bought it on steam. It's like the dark souls of open world games. I don't know if it took any inspiration from dark souls but it sure feels like they did.
Best game
really fun game
Truly a wonderful experience, a world entirely new that's breathtaking at every turn. The weakest points are the catacombs with reused bosses for small loot and gear. Entertaining first time around but offers much less replay-ability in my opinion than previous fromsoft installments. Don't let that deter you my first play through was over 100 hours and I enjoyed every second of it. Thrilling bosses and characters. However beware an old friend.

Great game, liked the holy dog

amazing game, first time playing this series and I was hooked!

The absolute pinnacle of souls games. Game of the decade. 10/10.
BEST game ever.
Oh my god, this game is a giant emotional roller coaster and I know that sounds bad, but the game is really rewarding has some of the best graphics I've ever seen. Most of the game is about trial and error, you walk into a boss you will probably loss pretty hard but either after awhile of trying or coming back later the boss feels less like a unbeatable powerhouse and more like a equal. The games characters, level design, spells/weapons, boss design, aptmisphere ect are all amazing. Never in a game have I walked into a room see a giant hand shooting magic orbs from his middle finger and stun locked him into oblivion with a oversized pizza cutter. Even with this in mind the game still has alot of problems their are alot of repeated bosses and content, the game is super overwelming for newcomers, alot of stuff you worked hard on doesnt give a good reward, and some stuff is just plainly unfair. Overall I still think this game is a master piece after overcoming the overwelming parts but could still have improvements which i'm hoping to see in the DLC
May be one of the best games I have ever played. Super rich lore behind the story, many diverse builds you can experiment with, and amazing soundtracks. Defeating enemies feels very rewarding and although fights can be tough, they are never impossible. Also, if you are into dark fantasy then this game will be perfect for you. It is everything you could wish for and more.
>:(
precious item ahead
FromSoftware does it again.

This game has the most satisfying exploration out of any games I've ever played. You always find something unique and interesting at every corner, minus those mushrooms of course.
pretty cool
Elden Ring does not, and will not hold your hand at any point. The start can be confusing and rough but once you start figuring things out and "Get Good" then the game really becomes the masterpiece that it is. The journey is incredible.

STICK WITH IT!

10/10




GAMER TIMEEEE
yes
This game is challenging, but so much fun! The story is great and the different endings make you want to play through more than once. Currently on my third play through. Highly recommend getting it now ahead of the DLC.
Yeah yeah you know about this game. Alls I can say is

Gideon is a coomer
Gas.
Elden Ring is perfect in my opinion, the world is beautiful, the game play is superb, it is incredible. The story is extremely good but the star of the show is the combat. While not as good as that of Sekiro, it does have really good combat that becomes very satisfying once you get the hang of it, contrary to what some reviews say. It has a really cool kind of multiplayer where it is optional to play with others. My only complaint about this game is that it has ruined other games for me, the only other game I can still have fun in is Sekiro, every other game is just boring in comparison to Elden Ring. If you don't mind the fact that you may no longer enjoy other video games then PLEASE get Elden Ring. If you are on the fence on getting Elden Ring just get it, it is worth it, I already preordered SOTE after enjoying the game so much. If you are just reading the reviews for fun then you should get the game, it is perfect.
I cant get past the first enemy group but I have to leave a positive review because this got GOTY or my house will be raided.
Just awesome.
simply a masterpiece

Obviously the game itself is great but expect to run into controller issues regarding DS5's. Put in about 6 hours worth of gameplay yesterday to log on today and have all of my save data gone. Has happened to me twice now, I will be uninstalling this one. Absolutely unacceptable for a AAA game in 2024.
Very nice game

very good pain game fun
This game is a masterpiece. I can't begin to explain and detail as to how much the game does a great job than ever before trying to tell you a story, while the sense of wonder and mystery is still there just like in the previous Soulsborne titles, but this time around, they are offering a bit more. The world tells a story even more so than ever before, and you will feel like exploring every nook and cranny as there may be something that escaped your view the first time you went that path. And there's so much to explore, the world really opens up and absorbs you in. Don't  expect to feel too challenged in this game compared to previous titles, as it's not focusing on that, and yes, there are some reused models, just like in other games.

I definitely recommend this game to long-time fans of the series and genre, and even if you didn't play the other games, but you would like to try something in this genre, do yourself a favor and try out this game. You won't be disappointed.
yum
S tier game
Finger,
but hole?
awesome
this good. play!
Gets hard in the beggining but after level 100+ its fun and not as irritating(IM ON THE VERGE OF SNAPPING MY DESK IN HALF)
makes me wanna smash my monitor. highly recommend
Such a terrible game, you can beat almost everything with a club and a shield. Constant interface problems, Poor camera management, Infinite loading screens, and all the other technical issues you can imagine of. But I must admit the art design team did a really good job.
yes
After playing Elden Ring, you feel like every previous game you paid 60$ for scammed you. because either Elden Ring is a 120$ game or every triple A game is a 30$ game at best value wise.
haha boss hp go bye bye
I have never played any From Software games but I've heard great things about Elden Ring and decided to try it out. It was great indeed! Not sure if anyone wants to actually read all this, but I want to share it anyway.

From reviews I knew that it has amazing worldbuilding that is provided in cryptic small pieces. And that the best way to play the game is to go in blind and try to figure things out by myself without any spoilers. So I did.  Played in offline mode. Did not look any information on the Internet aside from few technical things. 

What i enjoyed:  


[h1] Non-combat [/h1]


1. Open world freedom. After Stormveil I realized that pretty much all  of the game is optional. Do what you  want in whatever order you want. Your journey, your rules. Which is awesome as I love my games to be as non-linear as possible.    

2. Cryptic exposition. I spent hours wandering around the world, trying to learn its properties and its history, so I can understand what's going on. As of now I formed my own theory about what happened and read no external theories, so it would be nice to see other perspectives. It is the first game I played where there is so little exposition, it is an incredible way to project one's own views and think hard on the themes the game offers.   

3. Worldbuilding is exceptional, creative and huge. It is not just about how cryptic things are but also about how interesting the world is. And it is very interesting and full of variety. For example, it is rare to see developers to commit to weird ideas, but they did and it worked.   

4. Visual design is beautiful. The game invites screenshots, and I made a ton.   

5. One of the best videogames soundtracks ever. Not much to add.   

6. Also it is my first From Software game, so I had the first time experience with "lose XP on death and try to get it back". Ingenious design that makes even high-level play tense when you carry a lot of XP on you.


[h1] Combat [/h1]


1. I love how you don't exactly need to level up to beat the game. With enough mastery, stamina and will you can push and beat any boss you want with pretty much no skills and no gear. It is very very hard and I personally am not ready to try it. But it is possible. And, on the other hand, if you strategize and stack odds in your favor by exploring, finding and crafting items, designing a build, you are  rewarded.   

2. Ended the game on level 181, started as Astrologer, over time developed my character in a more or less well-rounded Sorceror who does not die from one hit. After finishing the game I realized it more and more that my build is awesome, but there are so many more to try out.   

3. And now that I finished exploring, I can try multiplayer. Looking forward to it.  

4. Beat every single boss there was to find. Boss battles in this game are great. You need to think and tailor your strategy for each one. And each has its own strong and weak sides, which may or may not correspond to strengths and weaknesses of your character. So some enemies, even supposedly tough ones, are a breeze for your build, while some, that may be considered weak, can give you a lot of trouble even on high level. 
  

[h1] Criticism [/h1]


One strong critcism I have for Elden Ring is the design of side-quests. Just hated it. For three reasons:
   
1. Most quests are linear and for me it does not mesh well with an otherwise open-world, "do what you want" design of the overall game. You have your journey and then it all stops so a writer can push an idea he had in mind. Sure, there is a choice to not complete the quest at all, but decision on whether to lock yourself out of content or not is not exactly a good choice to make. Aside from that a player has little impact on how to complete the quest, which sucks, because I really wanted to complete some quests very differently. And had no idea why my character acts so weird.   

2. Quests are cryptic. Sure, the whole game is cryptic, but when the quests are both linear and cryptic it turns completion into a search for needle in a haystack, which rubs me the wrong way. Riding all over the map, mowing down tons of enemies just to find one obscure character mentioned by another obscure character many hours ago is not fun for me personally. With a guide it would've been far easier, I guess.

3. Some quests are just disagreeable and weird. I tried to roleplay as a generally benevolent character, so I saw no reason whatsoever to help obviously shady or downright evil characters to complete their quests. Especially, since the quests are mostly linear and there is usually no way to trick the NPC like you can in Fallout games, for example.

A Sprawling Adventure with Minor Gripes: 

Elden Ring is a mesmerizing journey through a vast and intricately crafted world, where every corner holds secrets waiting to be discovered. As a player who have played a few of the other titles of FromSoftware, I found myself drawn into the rich game, with a challenging gameplay, and breathtaking landscapes that define this epic adventure.

Visually, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. While the graphics may not be the focal point of the experience, they serve as a stunning backdrop to the game's immersive world. The open-world design is nothing short of awe-inspiring, inviting players to explore every nook and cranny at their own pace. The addition of the jumping mechanic adds a new layer of verticality to exploration, making traversing the vast landscapes feel more fluid and dynamic than ever before.

One of the standout features of Elden Ring is its horseback traversal. The ability to summon and customize your steed adds a sense of freedom to the game, allowing players to roam the open plains with ease. It's a welcome addition that complements the game's open-world design perfectly.

However, Elden Ring is not without its flaws. While I personally enjoyed the challenge of facing off against formidable bosses, I can understand how some players might find the difficulty frustrating. Boss battles require patience, skill, and perseverance, which may not be to everyone's taste.

Another minor issue I encountered for the PC version, was with the controller support. While I recommend playing Elden Ring with a controller for the best experience, I was disappointed to find that there was no option to display PlayStation buttons for those using a PlayStation controller. Instead, Xbox buttons were shown, which could be confusing for some players.

Despite these minor grievances, Elden Ring is a triumph of game design. From its stunning visuals to its deep and engaging gameplay, it offers a truly unforgettable experience for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned Soulsborne veteran or a newcomer looking for a challenge, Elden Ring is an adventure well worth embarking on.

alright i guess
i love dyjng everytime
Top
Melania easy once at level 200+ Ranni is so bad def a good choice that I married her
tied for my favourite game of all time
has a learning curve if new to souls games
don't give up!
The main boss for the DLC is the volcano manor girl and rykards son because the trailer shows serpents coming out of his back. Also he usesd flames in the trailer but this is just an preditcion.
too easy, rolls give you i-frames for some reason. might just be a bug tho. Don't understand the elitism but the gatekeeping is good
fun
so beautiful
best game ever made
awesome sauce
Im depressed, stuck on malenia and im loosing my mind, would do it again and again
10/10
sword yes

fun and challenging.
bad game i dislike this very much
it's aight
I don't know what to tell you that you probably haven't heard already.

For me, this is the absolute perfect game. The difficulty scales inversely with how much effort you put in to exploration and learning. It's a hard game, for sure. There are tons of ways you can make it harder as well, but it's very easy to explore and get stronger and overcome those difficult fights. The game is non-linear, so you can skip to whatever parts you wish to explore as well, without fear of too many consequences. Of course, there are a few quest lines you can lock yourself out of if you jump too far ahead, but you're not likely worried about those quests if you're fighting bosses that far ahead.

The combat is smooth, the controls make sense. In a very combat-centric game such as this, that is very important. It feels good fighting and learning just when to dodge, how to attack to the best effect, and when you can pause for a breath. It's very satisfying taking down a more difficult boss with some well timed attacks and rolls, rather than beefing yourself to godlike levels.

The environments are beautifully rendered, each location being very different from the next. The scenery is gorgeous, and the sheer size of the map means there are so many beautiful vistas to find.

The characters are very colorful, and the richness of the lore is also found through exploration. You aren't spoon fed the game lore like in most RPG's, you have to look for it yourself. Flavor text in items, an off meeting with an NPC giving you hints, and even reflections of real world historical events can give context to the in-game lore. There are hundreds of hours of explanations and theories surrounding the Lands Between.

In short, didn't expect message.
If you enjoy the Dark Souls games or soul type games in general, I would definitely recommend giving Elden Ring a try!! The design of the game is stunning with a free to explore world with a well developed story line and side quests! Sure there are times where I want to uninstall the game xD but it does feel very rewarding when you defeat the small bosses and especially the big boss monsters. Highly recommend getting into the before the DLC drops!!
10/10 GREAT GAME
this games has almost endless ways to play it which makes each playthrough after ur first exciting even if you have explored everything because you get to play it again in a new special way plus you can also do some of the sidequests you missed on your first playthrough to get really good items

wang lao ju
best game ever made
good
game sucks
.
I wanted to wait to write a review until I was a good ways into this, and at 185 hours I'm only just getting into the endgame on my first playthrough. And with a game of this size and scope I think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion.

I've played all the Souls and Soulslikes and I went into Elden Ring with expectations based on those experiences. But what I've found is that it's not really a Souls game, it's Dark Souls 3 meets Skyrim, and necessarily more Skyrim than Souls but with less structure than either of them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with mixing genres, but I think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they're approaching it from. You could be an RPG gamer looking for an edgier Skyrim or a Souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding. So it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it's a game with very broad appeal. 

It's a huge open world game, and coming at it from the "I want Dark Souls 4" direction, I've found progression to be slow and a little confusing. I've gotten bogged down at times exploring, doing side stuff, but then that's not really any different than what I did in Witcher 3, a game I loved,  and other RPG's. I've also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot, you're clearly expected to take your time poking around, killing birds for arrow feathers, checking out dungeons, and so on.

It's this mixing of genres that's the essential concept of this game. In terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics Elden Ring doesn't reinvent the wheel, the combat is pretty similar to what Souls players are used to going back to the first Dark Souls. It has a plot very similar to Dark Souls 3, requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss. What's different here is that in Dark Souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn't problematic because you're going to be channelled along in a linear manner. But here you're just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own, without any direction. 

So if you're a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around, exploring, fighting a few bosses, without being pressured to get to specific goals, then Elden Ring works beautifully, And particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the Lands Between. And players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here, provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you're going to get there. So one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes(souls) needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while. Works both ways. 

And that's the beauty of it, it's intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers,  and it's done a very good job with that, particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven't played a Souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable. They clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they've accomplished here. It's not a perfect game, there are problems , the various pieces don't always mesh well, but it's a unique experience, full of interesting content, and after a lot of thought I very highly recommend it.


good game
Oh, Greatsword... Become my blade, once more

Score: 9.4/10
Very fun game and addictive
A masterpiece. That's all that needs to be said.

Best souls game in the series.

After playing this game for 1000+ hours on console and PC I can definitely say that is is one of the best if not the best game I have ever played. I couldn't recommend this game more.

A Masterpiece of Exploration and Challenge - Elden Ring Review

Elden Ring stands as a testament to FromSoftware's unparalleled ability to craft immersive worlds and challenging gameplay experiences. As a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series, I eagerly dove into the lands of the Lands Between, and I was not disappointed.

From the moment I stepped foot into the vast and beautifully crafted world of Elden Ring, I was captivated by its sheer scale and attention to detail. The landscapes are breathtakingly diverse, from lush forests to barren deserts, each area teeming with secrets waiting to be discovered. The sense of exploration is unparalleled, with every corner of the map beckoning me to venture forth and uncover its mysteries.

Of course, exploration would be nothing without the looming threat of danger, and Elden Ring delivers in spades. The combat is as challenging and satisfying as ever, requiring precision, patience, and a keen understanding of enemy patterns. Every encounter feels like a test of skill, with each victory bringing a sense of accomplishment unlike any other.

But perhaps what sets Elden Ring apart from its predecessors is its seamless integration of open-world mechanics. The addition of horseback riding and the ability to traverse the world at will adds a new layer of depth to the experience, allowing for greater freedom and immersion than ever before.

Of course, no game is without its flaws, and Elden Ring is no exception. Some may find the difficulty to be off-putting, and the sheer size of the world can be overwhelming at times. However, for those willing to embrace the challenge, Elden Ring offers an experience unlike any other, one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. From its breathtaking world design to its challenging gameplay, it represents everything that makes FromSoftware's games so beloved by fans. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer looking for a challenge, Elden Ring is an adventure that should not be missed.
loved it when he said its elden time and started to ring all over

Favourite game
The easiest Souls game, until it isnt
New to this style of game. Playing with my bro who is helping me. Loving it so far!
An absolute masterpiece with a high level of difficulty, but the difficulty is not there to block your path, the difficulty IS the path. Good luck!
Very Sigma game
It's as hard as you've heard, but it's never not fun. Dying isn't very punishing.
good

Good game, but not on GeForce Now...
Best Souls Like Game Ive PLayed.
Elden Ring is a thrilling journey where death isn't just an end, but a lesson. As you navigate its unforgiving landscape, every demise teaches, every discovery unfolds a new layer of beauty. The true essence lies not just in survival, but in the exhilarating pursuit of uncovering the world's secrets and conquering its formidable bosses.
finger, but hole.

This was my first Fromsoftware game. I'd always heard wonderful things. I'd also heard a lot about the challenge, the inaccessibility, and the learning curve. I went into Elden Ring with very little in the way of expectations. The aesthetic grabbed me. If I didn't like it, at least I could say I tried. Shortly after starting the story I was hooked. The challenge felt difficult but also fair. I got the sense from the very beginning that you are rewarded for effort. Now 100 hours in, the game continues to blow me away, to keep me playing, to make me want to progress. The design is blisteringly cool. The combat is fair, challenging, and rewarding. The specs and possibilities feel endless. This quickly became the best game I've ever played. It's not for everyone, but I HIGHLY recommend giving it a shot. You may have the same experience. If you don't, at least you can say you tried.
One of the most beautiful and creative games I have ever experienced.  Highly recommend.
Try not to break your controller when you get to the Dual Gargoyle fight

"Elden Ring" epitomizes the essence of the Soulsborne genre, offering a complex and rewarding journey that evolves from daunting to exhilarating. My personal voyage through this epic landscape was initially overshadowed by its notorious difficulty, but the game opened up significantly after navigating past the central castle area and especially once I discovered the right character build for my playstyle.

The turning point in enhancing my gameplay experience came with a strategic shift in character development‚Äîparticularly, allocating more stats to vitality. This adjustment made the game considerably more forgiving, allowing for extended exploration and combat endurance. The profound impact of such a simple change highlights an area where "Elden Ring" could improve: player guidance. For newcomers, the game's steep learning curve can be intimidating, and more accessible tutorials or resources to help players understand character building could greatly enhance the early game experience.

Graphically, "Elden Ring" is breathtaking, with each environment and panorama painstakingly crafted. However, performance issues in the later stages suggest a need for better optimization to maintain immersion without technical distractions.

The mythos of rising from a peasant to an Elden Lord is compelling, brilliantly integrating the theme of ascending to godhood as you grow in power. This narrative framework provides a rich backdrop that makes each player's progression feel significant and earned. Despite this, the game's conclusion can feel somewhat underwhelming, as it doesn't radically alter the world or reflect the monumental journey that led to it‚Äîa common critique in many open-world games.

Additionally, my experience was significantly enhanced by modifications I implemented myself, such as adjusting the game to run at 120 fps and enabling unlimited respec options. These modifications suggest that such features would be beneficial if included natively within the game, as they address fundamental aspects of gameplay fluidity and flexibility that can enhance player satisfaction.

As I anticipate the expansion "Shadow of the Erdtree," I reflect on "Elden Ring" as a landmark in gaming. It's a title that offers a profound, if sometimes perplexing, adventure that challenges players to explore, adapt, and conquer. The game stands as a pillar of the genre, offering a journey that is as rewarding as it is demanding, and continues to captivate with its promise of further expansions and enhancements.
Miyazaki you've done it again
God I need scarlet rotussy

I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Malenia, Goddess of Rot. That perfect, curvy body. Those perky breasts. The child-bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring to become the new Elden Lords.

I'd do ANYTHING for the chance to get Malenia, Goddess of Rot pregnant.

A N Y T H I N G.

And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to bear. Why would Miyazaki create something so perfect? To tantalize us? Laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just can't anymore.
its alright 10/10
Lame.

Pretends that making you remember attack patterns is the same thing as difficulty. Gameplay is basically Punchout but with more walking around.

Storytelling is abysmal. You literally will not understand the story without watching lore videos on it. Just skip the middleman.

No reason for the open world. You can explore and find rings and stuff, but none of that matters unless its a new weapon you don't have already since combat is skill-based instead of stat-based anyway. It just ends up making it take super long to get places at best and frustrating to navigate at worst. And, as previously mentioned, you won't find any lore that makes sense unless you've already watched lore videos.


If FromSoft isn't even going to pretend to put effort into the roleplaying in their games and just focus on the combat, they should just cut the crap and make boss rush games.
When I play this game this is me. I go like "Ahahhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" "woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow" then "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" then like "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES". I looooove this game dood.
good

.
The best game I ever played and ive played many since the 80s.
very ringy
great game, 10/10

THIS SHIT STINKS
HARD

realy realy great game
good :)
Nice game. You just have to try not to get hit and reduce your opponent's life points to 0 faster than he can reduce yours. The dodge roll is a very good tool. May chaos take the world!
Damn all that just to get a Ring?

Very overrated.

Gets boring really quickly and is just highly repetitive.
Filler content. 

I want to like this game, it looks and feels nice to play, but its just boring after a few hours.
definitely reccomend this game.
A game of beauty, full of adventure awaiting for you ahead~

Best game ever

Life is to short to wait for bleedproc. ‚òÖ
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.
OPPY DAY
..........a. m. a. i. z. i. n. g. Boom na da noom na nemena, da Boom na da noom na nemena. GO
played it a bit kinda good 
e
Overall fantastic experience in my first 20 hours the only problem I am having is the screen freezing. I have seen this is a common experience among pc players and i wish fromsoft would fix this issue. Other than that though amazing game!!
Perfect.
One of the best i have ever played
Obrigado, Miyazaki.
This game is just incredibly bautiful and one of the best games I've ever played. 
But... these revenants and fingercreepers... fck them they are annoying and disgusting af.
 I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.
what more can i say other than BUY THE DAMN GAME YOU WONT REGRET IT AT ALL 10/10 CANT WAIT FOR DLC
Not sure why this game is still crashing. PC specs are fine. Works fantastic on steam deck though?
onion ring
Highly recommend, especially if you have open world game fatigue and if you're okay failing alot before improving.

Over 2 years since its release, I can see why it won game of the year in 2022. I have never played a souls game. I've always been deterred by the very vocal souls players with how much they brag and obsess about difficulty. 

However, I originally got this game because of I was looking for an open world game that didn't have the ubisoft gps tracker., minimap and objectives where it spoon feeds you everything. Another reason was I got a taste of souls combat from Code Vein because its frequently on sale and cheap and thought had nothing to lose. I did enjoy souls combat but felt it was too linear and pigeonholed me into playing a certain way. 

Elden Ring is a great game to durdle with. I often joke with my friend call the game Durdle Ring. The first 50 hours was me durdling around finding random cool gear or finding cool settings and taking in the atmosphere. The set design of the game is really well done. It was a breath of fresh area compared to open world games which handhold you in exploration.

Durdling also included exploring which playstyle fit me. I learned early on Im bad at melee combat, I panic too much and struggle to be close enough to an enemy to hit itwith a sword. But there are several ranged playstyles I found that fit my tendency to panic when being attacked and was viable enough to bring me to completing a playthrough. 

Whats great is that there are enough tools to help the player overcome bosses from weapons, skills, gear, summons, and co-op which helped relieve how daunting the game felt. 

Fia best girl
it was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details.
GOOD
There are no words to appropriately describe the immense joy and fun I have while playing this game. Elden Ring takes concepts from other Soulsborne titles, improves upon them, and goes beyond expectation. The open world is beautiful with a lot of locations to explore and goodies to grab. The bosses are fun, challenging, and always satisfying to beat. With such a wide variety of content to explore, it is very difficult to run out of things to do. It's why I have so many hours in this game: I never got bored of it.

My main criticism come more from personal experience rather than concepts the game has. Notably, the world feels smaller when you learn where everything is and avoid places to fight bosses or get items you don't need. This is to be expected as with other entries to the franchise, the experience feels linear and shorter with each playthrough. Despite this, I am still amazed at this beautiful world each time I ride through it.

Please do yourself a favor and try this game. It is difficult, punishing at times, but the immense satisfaction and relief from beating a boss you've been stuck on for 5 hours never fails to make the mood better. Who knows, you may just find a personal favorite encounter.
Yeah it's pretty good
Awesome game, if a bit difficult at first. Persevere !
9/10. A brilliantly crafted dark fantasy world with endless options on how you want to tackle the games many complex bosses. 
The progression system is one of the fairest and best feeling that I've experienced. 
The lands between while it may feel huge as some detailed intricacies to it and lots of secrets to explore. 
The soundtrack is built perfectly to not be overwhelming during exploration but instead really shine through the big battles. 
The game may sometimes struggle with performance and not be the best visually looking games out there but who am I to really care when I'm swinging a huge badass sword against some massive boss with instruments and a choir blasting through my ears.
I would like to remember the first time i play this game :((, it was very goood
Awesome game its one of the best games ive ever played in my life.
GREAT GAME
good game
fuck it we cannon of haima

but I ain't complaining
You don't have the right, O you don't have the right, you don't have the right, O you don't have the right.
Masterpiece of a game. The combat is exceptional, the graphics are amazing, and the open world is just breathtaking. Elden Ring surpasses most of the games made by Formsoft (besides bloodborne.)
totally worth every penny, 10/10
Game called me maidenless 
10/10
lost of fun. Easier then other souls games but still a challenge
Pretty good
By far the best game I've ever played.
there's nothing to say other than awesome game
very fun game. Accepting the fact that i was gonna die to just about everything helped me through my playthrough(s). Definitely recommend this game is an amazingly terrifying experience
this game is very bonerektged      AMD VERY ggS BASKRIMD
fun.
10/10
If your on the fence about this game just get it. After 60 hours of gameplay i have %100 completed the game. It is a masterpiece. And i cant wait to start another play through
Did you ever think to yourself, "Man, I wish I could be relentlessly beaten like a neglected child"
Well, this is game for you, whilst it doesn't include a belt-wielding father figure, it at least somewhat attempts to convey why you were beaten in the first place.
I would legit put this on the list of the best games I've ever played. This game was so good to me that after beating the pirated version, I bought the real game and started again. (so you can basically add another 117h to my playtime)

Note that this game will have some amount of BS like any other souls-game but besides that there aren't any major issues I could find. 
Tho keep in mind that this game isn't for everyone. I, for example, couldn't have really enjoyed myself that much if I didn't use https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki    , since I don't have that much free time at Uni. These games surely left a positive mark on this period of my life.
you: *encounter the first enemy*
the enemy: why do you even try
game: You Dead *in red*

this is not a game. this is pure pain.
I mean, what more is there to say
the goat
This game has beaten me to a pulp than repeated the process a dozen times over 10/10 (Will take it even more for the dlc)

Only a little bit of time. But this game is a ten out of ten!!! But it will make you not have a life only had game for two days. But its good , you will want to end it all at some point but dam it fells good getting over it!! Would recommend!

Prepare to cry.
Great elevation of the soulslike formula by the team who gave us that genre.
Dexterity build W
This is my favorite game in the world.
this game is the most anticipating of the century i look forward to the dlc :)
So if you're not new to Soulsborne games and somehow haven't played this, play it.

If you're new to them, imagine the following: You're in a dark medieval fantasy world, armed with some basic gear, and 95% of the world wants to kill you on sight. You're not the protagonist who is destined to save the world, you're just some nameless NPC. 
Now imagine you go out and try to defeat those enemies. Maybe you get a few of them, but inevitably, you die to something. A boss, or an unexpected powerful enemy, or fall damage.
And you get up, and try again. But this time, you're a bit better.
You still fail again, but now you've learned something new about one of the enemies.
On the third try, you make it further. A terrible monster destroys you.
You get back up again. And this time, you succeed. 
You find a safe place, and take a breather. Bit by bit, you find new items. You level up. 
You're stronger now. But not only that, your timing has gotten better. 
Three days later.
You're in a new place, one filled with even worse enemies, and a swamp that poisons you. There's a message on the ground from a fellow player. "I want to go home," it reads. You sympathize. Me too, buddy. You cross the swamp and see another message from some poor soul. "Be wary of right," it says. You creep toward the next corner, and spot an enemy waiting in ambush. You defeat it easily and give kudos to the other player's message.
The other player is in the middle of a heated boss battle, and they're out of heals. They're dodging frantically, and suddenly, your kudos gives them a free heal. They go on to defeat the boss, thanks to your anonymous help.

These are the kinds of moments that await you in this game. It's full of struggle, tragedy and triumph. If you're new, use everything at your disposal, because the game doesn't pull punches. Look up guides, find useful weapons on the wiki. Do whatever it takes to win. Don't let anyone tell you that you're playing it wrong.

Elden Ring was the first time I fell in love with a Soulsborne game, and it has since convinced me to go back and play others, especially Dark Souls 3.

Good luck. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go hollow.
fought Margit while listening to Black by Pearl jam. very cinematic. 10/10
Elden Ring
Miyazaki has done it again
The best soulsborne title and my favorite but 100% not perfect. It has issues and problems. I cannot recommend it enough. 

The modding scene is fascinating and already rich with potential. Check out 'convergence' and 'seamless co-op'

Edits: some minor rewording, no substantial changes
I gave Elden my Ring
Most fun ive had hating myself!
big sword goes swoosh
im still stuck at Margit, im level 240 and i still cant beat him
goat pls buy it
peak
A victim RPG- have you wondered how it would feel like to play a victim of abuse? this is the game for you
You're missing out if you haven't played this yet, its just that good.
Its just a easy and fun game
Beautiful game, very frustrating at times but overall amazing.
I think this might be the best game ever made. The environment/atmosphere is just incredible. Throughout my whole playthrough I was immersed in the world and story. The gameplay is smooth and there is a way to make nearly every playstyle you can think of work. I will without hesitation be purchasing the DLC when it comes out.
game good
It's  FromSoft game. Its HARD, you're going to die, repeatedly, even when you think you've gotten good, you'll die anyway. That being said, I'm on NG+4 and having an absolute blast, the world is huge, and multidimensional. Every time I run through a NG I find new things, new story lines and quests, new areas, new bosses, new items and interactions. It's an amazingly deep and well built story and world with secrets and lore and alternate endings and replay-ability rarely found in games nowadays. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who likes, or wants to get into, Souls-like games. I'm really excited for the DLC this summer, and I'm that by then, I'll have racked up a good 100 more hours into it. 10/10

Love this game , love this franchise. Demon Souls hooked me back in the day, nothing like it.

Praise the sun!
I've beaten a couple of the other Dark Souls games (+ their DLC), and I think Elden Ring is a better game but I prefer the Dark Souls lore in many aspects.  I agree with most people who say that Elden Ring is much easier than the other games, but I think that actually makes it a generally better game.  Elden Ring finds a better balance between feeling challenging and feeling fun.  There were plenty of times in the Dark Souls games where I was just frustrated by how unnecessarily punishing they were... Like when I first played Dark Souls II and I couldn't summon any co-op allies because I died too many times and was locked out of multiplayer by soul memory... Or in Dark Souls III when I had to run through Lothric castle over and over again to get back to the second boss fight after each time dying...  Those kinds of clunky difficulty just made the Dark Souls games more frustrating, not more fun.
One of the best games of all time. No exaggeration.
‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have the right, O you don‚Äôt have the right

Best game out there that allows me to feel the old D&D days taking my imagination & creating it in an awesome, large world to explore & conquer.

Obviously this is one of the best games made by this company, arguably ever made, period. This game is great an you should play it.
I got gud
fun and Malenia is a very easy boss trust.
After having reached level 100, after finding good weapons with cool looking armour and after killing a lot of bosses, a regular bird mob ambushed and killed me on a snowy mountaintop.
10/10 video game. 

Good Gam
Elden Ring ring isn't for everyone. But it is for me. There's a reason it won so many awards when launched. Why so many players have multiple play throughs under their belts. Because it is indeed amazing.

I personally love this game. It's become one of my top games of all time.
very juicy
Frenzied flame ending parkour > Melenia
everything good about video games is elden ring
Made Blust 10/10, would again
Big sword make man happy
i spent $80 on this game.
i will get my moneys worth out of it even if every second makes me want to commit sudoku
This game save my life from League of legends and make me dive into more challenging games, started to play the other souls, never regret my choice of played it.
fun
absolutely

Yes
im in love with melina.
its challenging but fun

i think i died, not too sure, might need another "you died" screen to lmk
Just.. play this game.

Miyazaki's most complete game in every way can be Elden Ring! He learned from all the bugs of his previous games and fixed them in the best way in his new game! The game is worth every second you spend on it and you can enjoy every minute of the game.
play if you're maiden-less.
This Game made my little brother kill himself
GIVE IT A TRY. you arent bad at the game its just you getting started.. remember that while playing through for you first souls like game. 10/10

You need to read a tutorial first and not expand your discovery at the beginning, watch youtube videos for help at the beginning, understand the stats and what each means
good game. i plan on completing it multiple more times.
deserved goty
Why does this game hurt me so much?
Cool game very much
Fun & Easy for the whole family
Please provide UltraWide support in your games.
sigma
Awesome game
I'm so bad but the game is so good
Very good combat and also so much content thats keeps you entertainted.Also amazing bosses and cool armors to choose from.
What can I say that hasn't been said before. Try it out and have fun :)
best game ever played. I have 200 hours on elden ring and i can say to yall that this game is a masterpiece , although it takes patience to beat it and a lot of nerves . I would not recommend this game if you are new to the gaming world. The good thing about elden ring is that when a part is too hard for you, you can just go somewhere else and go on there.

its really worth the money :)
A gritty satire on today's seafood crisis in the lower Manhattan area, which would leave no heart unperturbed. Fight your way to reclaim the status of the one true dishwasher amongst the  fallen ashes of the last joint for today.

That is, I have no idea what's going on, but the game is fun af.
Excellent all around, immersive and engaging gameplay with high but fair challenge, intriguing story, well designed open world and levels, top-tier soundtrack and a whole lot more, astoundingly wide variety of content. truly an incredible, unforgettable experience
amazing game, pretty hard, but doable, dont let the toughness discourage you!
gud game
the most fun i've ever had in a souls game.

fun
Ahh, I knew you'd come.
To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.
What a sad state of affairs.
I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.
Queen Marika has high hopes for us.
That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.
Huge fan of the souls-borne series love this and if you wanna coop this game use the seamless coop mode but be warned you cant use characters made on mod in base game else you be banned
i can bonk
meh
Elden Bling
Everything I can say has been said a thousand times over. It's Elden Ring. I'm surprised you are even looking here to see if its good.
oh yeah
Greatest game of all time!
Very poor game mechanics.
GOAT
I want Rani to give me a handjob with all four of her hands
best purchase ever. that is all. XD
gud
elden ring
I mean... its elden ring.
yes
We have finished this game on all available platforms the attention to detail is like no other souls game Dont kill npcs at the beginning of the game or you might get stuck in a loop of death life death life etc. one of my favourite games of all time cant wait for the DLC
gUd
godskin duo is shit
Coming from traditional soul games I thought this one wasn't for me, lets just say I was wrong...
the best of all
everything
One of the best games I have ever played

After 100 hours, I can safely say that Elden Ring is single-handedly the worst game I have ever played and my multiple save files can show my lack of interest. You can call me an Elden Ring hater, because I am. I would only recommend this to people who like video games. Also, I will be purchasing the DLC just to confirm my factual opinion. This is a copycat of Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, and King's Field IV. 

10/10, Bill Clinton
The is the best game ever createD by mankinD
elden ring :thumbs_up:
lots to do, super tedious, but really fun
GOOD
crazy
This game is truly a masterpiece! It looks stunning and the story is really well made. What makes this better for Dark Souls noobs, is that you can just go and do another area when you get stuck. I can't wait for the DLC!
bad game
The top tier souls like game that packs a lot of great variety, amazing boss battles in a vast open world package. If you find the Dark souls series appealing then this is the must have title by every stretch of the imagination.
good game
Why not

Finally, some good fucking Souls.
Pros:
- Movement problems are gone
- Builds are balanced (some more than other)
- you can beat every mob or boss by a slight adaptation of your movements and a few by choosing the right weapon/skill.
- USE BLOOD AND TWIN BLADES if you don't know what to do.
- It's beautiful like the previous ones.
- the lore, THE LORE.

Cons:
- 60 fps? really? What year is this? 2012?

Easiest Souls games I've ever played. Not really a bad thing.
i hate this game so much.
makes me feel suicidal.
If you are Alt boy/girl I would recommend you to play you will feel at home
is pree gud gam
Class game, upa ra
genuinely love this game! 50 hours played so far and many of them have been frustrating but, this is a souls style game after all!. would highly recommend playing this game to anyone, one the best games I've played in a good while.
Yes
Not Bloodborne good...but good

Ohhhh.........Elden Ring..........

No but seriously I love this game, the build variety is wild and the world design is killer, I'm still discovering new things after 900 hours. And if the gameplay somehow gets stale for you, there's loads of mods to change things up.
¬≠
The elden Lord
w game
I am going say that I don't like a lot of the game design choices for  this game. A lot of them are straight up garbage. Most of the boss mechanics are beyond trash and frustating. The things that I love about this game is the story, the world building, and level design of this game. I love it a lot and that is the only reason why am giving it thumbs up.


The bosses in this game are some of the most frustrating bosses I have ever dealt with compared to something like WoW, FFXIV, and even DS3 (first 13 hours). I don't have I single boss that I actually liked in this entire game because you have to redo the entire battle knowing that it may be few attempts or you just summon someone to help you. Especially the last boss Elden Beast was the only boss I had to actually summon someone to help me with due to mimic not being good enough to make it second phase. I will say I got the Elden Beast to 12% and that I was why I summon a player.

The world design is just amazing. I loved every second of exploring the world. It the only reason why I put this many hours into this game. I love going everywhere and looking at things. The problem is that it was never rewarding, but seeing lore I guess was sort of rewarding. I only two weapon this entire game the starter weapon for samurai and River of Blood. I loved the River of Blood since it was my type of play style of just messing up the mobs.

The story is was decent and I enjoy it a lot. I personally went with Ranni Age of Star since was the only ending that I liked personally. I just wish there was more world building and world changing element, but that just not a Fromsoftware type of thing since they care more about combat and game design which isn't a bad thing until they completely screw it up in Elden Ring.

6/10 is my final score. Cannot wait to rage at more fromsoftware game.
fuck this game
Your strength, extraordinary...
ranni fine asl


Put a ring on it.
amazing game
this game is like a toxic girlfriend. it beats you up, takes your stuff, insults and berates you, and yet you keep coming back for some reason
just so you know i try to play this game solo but it sucked so try seamless co-cp mod its a lot more fun that way
It's good
You don't need me to tell you.  It's Elden Ring man.
One of the greatest games ever made, simple as that.
Easily one of the best games ever made

its ok
Dark Souls if it was open world and you could summon ghost slaves. 10/10 would recommend.
elden ring is fire

Not for everybody, but for someone who likes a good challenge, this game is damn near perfect.

That is all.
A great game that starts slow, but picks up steam and snowballs extremely effectively towards the latter half of the game.
Beat the game countless times on Ps4 and love the vanilla game experience, now that I'm on PC I'm loving the modded experience and recommend you at least try the seamless co-op mod with a friend.
this game makes me squee :D
great  game  if you like to die in video games alot
Absolutely GREAT game. The algorithm for bosses however is so cheesy and trash it's insane. Input reading when rolling, using potions, throwables, or anything makes every boss fight feel so inorganic. It's not even hard, It's just spammy bullshit
I have 400 hours on Elden Ring on my PS5
just got it here cuz i wanted to play modded
bought this twice, and buying the dlc twice. 260 dollars spent on this game. 
this game sucks
Fire Game
Lets go
Nothing is intuitive, the world is feels empty yet is full of monsters ready to kill you in every direction as soon as you start. The combat system itself isn't really hard to grasp, but the unpredictability of enemy attacks and inability to manage FP as a beginner in early game provide the ultimate challenge. I haven't gained a single new weapon, piece of armor, or anything really so far. It's just an endless loop of running god knows where, encountering a giant monster, then dying. I have had no fun at all so far playing this game, and I can't believe there's people out there that enjoyed this piece of shit so much that it won GOTY
I've bought this twice because i hate myself that much.

10/10
HEhehehehe he heh e
nice
10/10 so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
already got 100%, bring bloodborne to pc
it's good but most of the vanilla armors suck so much ass
Very fun
yall gas this game up way too much. relax.
good but seamless coop bug
yuh
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!

yes
Just parry!
This game is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever picked up, and yes its a souls-like, but it's so pretty it's unreal. I bought this game around launch and played it through then for 80hrs or so and then picked it back up to 100% as I loved it so much. The real star is the seamless coop mod. Its honestly a completely new experience and playing through with a friend at the same time really brings a whole new aspect to boss fights and just exploring in general. 
100% would recommend
 one of the games in history
nice
This game has many certified Mohg moments
Precious item ahead
Praise the message!

Probably the best game I've played in my life, and most frustrating, and amazing.

its good
One of the best game I've ever seen or watched other ppl play and played myself. I have bought this game twice on 2 different platform just so I can play with all my friends. But only if there's more happy npc quest ending (tears).
Top 5 best games of all time!
Level 1 runs are fun :)
At first dropped it cause of the difficulty but then got bored and beaten the entire game in 2 weeks and it was difficult but that's the point
Never thought I'd 100% this. Got halfway through the first time and quit. It was too much. Came back a year later after falling in love with lore videos. Got hooked. Redefined gaming for me. Absolutely amazing.
insane game
Elden Ring isn't just a game, it's an adventure of the highest order.
FromSoftware has once again proven themselves as masters of their craft, forging an experience that transcends mere entertainment and ascends to the realm of artistry.
At its core, Elden Ring is a testament to meticulous world-building. The Lands Between sprawls before you, a vast and intricate artifact of lore, history, and mystery waiting to be unraveled. Every crumbling ruin, every tangled forest, every desolate battlefield is infused with a sense of place and purpose, inviting exploration and discovery at every turn.
But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its unparalleled sense of freedom. In a genre often plagued by linear storytelling and rigid progression,  FromSoftware has shattered the mold, offering players an open world of staggering scope and depth. Whether scaling towering mountains or delving into the darkest depths of underground catacombs, the sense of agency is palpable, empowering players to forge their own path and shape their own destiny.
Of course, such freedom would be meaningless without meaningful gameplay to accompany it, and Elden Ring delivers in spades. Combat is a symphony of steel and sorcery, demanding precision, timing, and strategy. Every encounter is a test of skill, pushing players to their limits and rewarding mastery with a sense of satisfaction unlike any other.
But perhaps most remarkable of all is Elden Ring's ability to weave its gameplay and narrative together into a seamless tapestry. Every boss slain, every quest completed, every secret uncovered feels like a piece of a larger puzzle, driving the story forward and deepening the player's connection to the world and its inhabitants.
In the end, Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a masterpiece. A towering achievement that sets a new standard for all of gaming, and reaffirms FromSoftware's status as one of the greatest developers of our time. Whether you're a fan of action RPGs or simply appreciate storytelling and lore in games, Elden Ring is an experience not to be missed.

True Classic.
The best game
recomand, ramaneti cu probleme si instabilitati psihice
The geographical expansion
10/10 if u don't love your self  u should play this game one of the best in its style
great game
This is the whey
suicidal
Very fun, but very challenging. Be prepared for a lot of discouraging moments, but if you stick it through and get help from other when you need it then this game really starts to pay off. I love it! I did quit on PS5 very early on and decided to retry on PC 6 months later and I'm happy I did. I found outthat my main problem was my starting class the first time on PS5. Be sure to look into the qualities of each starter character before choosing cuz it really messed me up choosing the wrong at first.
everything i wanted and more
Very chill game <3
Absolute Masterpiece
goa t
yellow dark souls is pretty good.
look for the old jewelry
Amazing game could play it for thousands of hours and never get bored of it.
Let's be honest here - for a "classical" mouse&keyboard PC gamer, the UI is prehistoric and atrocious, camera behaviour and controls leave a lot to be desired, and developers (or people who ported the game to PC) certainly never touched a PC in their life.

But if you manage to see past those issues, the game is fantastic. Huge open world, wonderful landscapes and music. You feel your skills challenged all the time, but if you want to just roam the land without challenge - you certainly can. The lore... is there. It doesn't jump in your face, you don't feel burdened with "profound dialogues", but if you want a story, it'll be there for you too. Solid boss fights, mysterious characters, lots of things to explore and discover.
Buy The game
It's alright I guess
The 2024 eclipse was an Elden Ring reference.
skibidi sigma
Bonafide masterpiece. Nuff said.
simply peak
GOOD :)
Fanstic game for all the maidenless out there! 200 hours to completely the first playthrough, exploring every nook and crany. I suck at soul games so I cheesed through the whole game with a sorcerer build (trying to look up as little as possible online). Now I enter my second playthrough as a warrior!
amazing game, but the optimisation is HORRIFIC! the constant crashes, and I have done everything to mitigate it, run as admin, barely any background activities. I have an RTX 4090 and Ryzen 9 7950X 64GB RAM and the frames drop constantly even if I drop down to low settings and 1080p. it performs the same at low res low settings as it does at 4K Ultra...

full clean install with no bloat, not one single other game has issues running at 4K 60+ Ultra... except this one. I REALLY hope the DLC is coming with some improvements to the game as its just awful crashing, usually when you're about to kill a hard boss.
Open world Soul game with exceptional setting, imagery and vision.  The structure and game play tread a well worn path, but a very well built and engineered path indeed.  All the typical hall marks are here, including many challenging bosses, no hand holding (there are online guides if you don't like this approach) and a difficultly that demands focus and patience, without being unfair.  Some frustrating idiosyncrasies carry on from previous games, albeit minor and to some extent do add to the macabre and unforgiving tone.  

While the game benefits from the open world, it is hard to distinguish between how much value this adds or if it is the setting and visual imagery.  The artistic style with stunning visual setting at every turn is worth admission alone.

If you enjoy Soul games, this is special.  I can't say enough how stunning The Lands Between is to traverse and how majestic the various lands are behold.  For those few how haven't tried a Soul game before, patience is a virtue.
good
It is amazing
great combat
just an overall great game
Peak game, just buy it
would recommend not to let the moghlester touch you
this game made me cry

margit toes
im a victim here but lowkey i like that
Non stop performance issues - spent 80 hours trying to bare with how awfully it ran. It cannot hold a consistent 60fps, stutters every 30 seconds (sometimes multiple times a second) and has insane input delay with everything - all of these issues making the game look and play abysmally. DSR, DS2, DS2SotFS, DS3 and Sekiro do not have any of these issues so I don't get how they dropped the ball so hard with this release.

Fantastic game, I sunk 89 hours into it in two weeks, make sure you don't do the same. There's some aspects that are really just annoying with how they've designed certain bosses, instead of adding difficulty they just make some bosses extremely unfun and impossible to read or have the stamina bar to dodge all the attacks of and still have enough for an attack. George RR Martin went crazy with the story though, and the design is pretty great. Really wish they wouldn't nerf anything that's fun to use except for sorceries, I'm not tryna be a soycerer.
weapons in this game are way too overpowered, shit dumb
good game
i need bigger weapon
Be  patient, no need to stress or rush or bother facing any bosses for the first 50+ hours of gameplay, get the hang of it if you've never actually played a fromsoft game before. Just take in the view, enjoy the landscape. Everything you see can be reached. Everything. (except the water, do not attempt to swim at any point. Regrets.)
At least, this is what I wish I knew when i was stressing that I couldn't get past all the early content, and rushed to explore the whole map before I really engaged with any content. Do i regret this? Only because it broke all the questlines.
Such a pretty game, so many weird lore bits you will probably never understand.
Why do the sheep roll, for example. No one knows.
Just keep running, you'll be fine.
:)
Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron... honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, "CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!" Not only have you changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, Lebron James.ü´∂

masterpiece
Peak gaming right here. Cant wait for the DLC üëè
yeah a must play game
If you have the patience and commitment this game is incredible!
awesome
Game do be fun
Good game
its good
Absolutely stunning visuals, excellent voice acting, immersive world design, some interesting boss fights, and amazing lore. A plethora of combat options to go for that means the game will never really get repetitive. It'll be as difficult as you wish it to be, according to weapon and build of choice.

It's a game that is impossible to fully enjoy without extensive use of a wiki, so be aware of that. Bear in mind also that it's very easy to hit a wall around mid-game where you are too underleveled to proceed and you might not know where to go next - some grinding is absolutely necessary. Would absolutely recommend prioritising vigor.

Note also that a few fights (Malenia?!?!) are straight up unfair and cumbersome - don't ever be afraid to summon your ashes throughout the game.

From a technical perspective the game is acceptable, although FromSoftware could've done a better job porting to PC - my computer crashed quite a few times. A few frame drops in busy areas despite beefy PC specs being used.
70+ hours still dying to trash mobs in Limgrave

Behold, Erdtree!
Absolutely an ABSURD start for a game for someone that has never played ANY soul games. Fucking incredible!!!

just buy it already üòÅ
Game so big, you don't feel like touching grass. But in all honesty this is as peak as peak gets.
It is nice
best game ever
Fuck Haligtree
Edit: maybe not so bad
i like to suffer.
such a beautiful game, buy it
Goated, just like me.
Great and fantastic game if you get excited about the exact things I am not excited about. I think anyone who enjoys getting good at games like Street Fighter and MOBAs will get an absolute kick out of this. It definitely asks you to learn how to play From Software games. Even if you're generally Good At Games you'll have to pick up new ways of thinking and risk-assessing to get anywhere. And even if you've picked up on how to get the things you want, you'll have to execute it very well to get them. It's just such a not-for-me-but-great-for-someone-else-game.
Do not play this game it¬¥s a trap. A trap so good that will have you hours farming an exploring a super cool world dammit.
Blue raspberry coochie
Lots of fun, doing co-op with buddies is always fun (especially the random funny shit that comes with that), if you enjoy souls games it's definitely worth the pick up.
nice game GOTY
GOOD
i love greatsword
yes
Another fine addition to the SoulsBorneRing Die-Twice lineup
 I got soft-banned for reinstalling because of storage problems
very very fun. (except the godskin duo)
elden ring is the best game to touch this earth ever. the u can play the game over and over again and it will still be fun. however the CO-OP is not very good and could use some change but every aspect of the game is just great the pvp is good the boss are good the challenge of the game makes it also very fun. another thing so good about this master piece is that the lore in the game is crazy and even after beating the game if u think its to easy u can go to another play threw and fight a stronger version of the boss. this game was a master piece POINT.
amazing game
worth
Great Game.
:)
probably my favorite game ever
elder bing is not cool i think
bahhhhh
and i said that's not an albinauric, that's my wife!
Arise now Ye Tarnished.

One of if not the best game I have ever played. Ive never had a game intrigue me so much with its story and world. The two tie into one another so perfectly, the exploration naturally promotes finding bits of lore out as they help you explore the world's secrets. The game is not perfect by any means, but for what was made and presented its one of the best experiences one can have within media and literature. I have not experienced a game like this since Hollow Knight. I put 120 hours into my first playthrough and I cannot imagine how many more I'll put into this game on future runs. I cannot recommend this game enough if you somehow haven't played it.
I punched another god in the face
this shit hard
Once in a life experience
this game has given me a new addiction

Best dating simulator ever

great gam
cool sword go bonk
Great game overall, but is still sold to russians. Even new DLC is available for purchase with rubbles. 

While most sane developers support Ukraine by restricting sales of their games in Russia, Fromsoftwere don't care about the biggest war in Europe since WW2, shame on them. 

I hope reputation losses for them will be way greater than any possible profits from Russia.
One of greatest games ever made. Its nearly perfect.
Bloodborne better
Good rpg with so much to explore. If you don't get frustrated every 15 minutes you aren't doing something right.
ü§Ø
It's one of the most rewarding games i've ever played.  The boss fights are okayyy. the explorations is fine, but game of the year? I think not. 6/10
10/10
does not have bed of chaos or shrine of amana but still good
It's very good.  Despite some lingering worries about repetition of bosses, it really is jam-packed with stuff to discover and triumph against.  It's not my favourite "Souls" game of all time, but you'd be hard pressed to find one with more bang for your buck.  Elden Ring is also a great intro for beginners to the genre as well.

Dont hurt dog!
OOOOOHHHH.....ELDEN RING...OOooOOOOHHH...

[spoiler] one of the greatest games of all time [/spoiler]

Great game, just a little confused on quests. Very little guidance on where to go and what to do.

great game worth the price, cant wait for the DLC
i liek
Pretty good game. Open world like zelda, dungeons like darksouls. Great lore.
gud game  :] last boss no gud
everything is good but the last achievement (the one that is to get all the other achievements) Don't work for me ):
not good for your mental and physical health!
Try fingers, but hole....

This game cured my depression, 10/10
My favorite game of all time (I played for 200 hours on console before switching to PC). I can only recommend it!
unreal game
best game ever played
Maybe the best 60 dollars I have ever spent. Highly recommend downloading the Seamless coop mod to play with your friends.
Fun bosses, lots of ways to play with character stats. 

Would like a more seamless co-op but there's a mod for this.

Easy to get wrapped into the characters, the game doesn't hold your hand and I love that.

Elden Ring is a triumph of imagination and gameplay. FromSoftware's latest masterpiece invites players into a sprawling world filled with breathtaking landscapes, deep lore, and challenging combat. With its sense of freedom and endless exploration, it's more than just a game‚Äîit's an unforgettable adventure waiting to be experienced. If you're ready to embark on a journey unlike any other, Elden Ring is waiting to captivate you.
This game ruined most other games for me. Every other games feels boring with few exceptions.
best game of all time
It's finally starting to click why these games are so loved.
I don't think I need to really sell this one. By now, you probably know if you like souls-like combat, and that'll always be the crux of this game. It's insanely pretty, I think the dungeon crawls are engaging, the bosses are largely very cool, and the lore is fun. 

Personally, I could probably take about 30% less open world than this game gives and still find it perfectly satiating, but that's hardly a knock against it.
Something amazing ahead
Secret path ahead! Liar ahead!

Fromsoft's well-praised (and rightfully so) level design continues in the open-world format. It is an absolute joy to play. From the sprawling landscapes to the intricately designed dungeons, Elden Ring's open-world format amplifies the sense of exploration and discovery that Fromsoft games are known for. I am more than excited to replay the game following the release of the new DLC.
MAY RANNI TAKE THE WORLD!!!
:)
fun
i want bloodborne on pc
I hate myself

Edit: Not as much

Edit Edit: I AM ELDEN LORD
One of the best games ever made, screw the fire giant though.
Something incredible ahead.

My favorite game of all time from childhood was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. I still watch content about that game today and have gone back and played it a couple times. No game has ever made me feel the same way I do about Ocarina of TIme, but then Elden Ring came along. This is easily one of the best games ever made to date in my opinion. So many countless playthroughs always differing and finding new things you didn't find before. There is a seamless coop mod that makes playing with friends much more enjoyable but playing this game alone is a wonderful time as well. You find yourself getting sucked in and immersed in the scenery and enviorments. This is one of those games that you say youll just sit down and play for an hour or so but then you realize you played the entire day away and had a blast doing it. Even when you are stuck at some frustrating ass boss theres something about it that doesnt make you feel like youve hit a major wall. Maybe its that its open world and if your stuck you can go explore and get stronger and come back later. Torrent is a little sensitive when trying to turn back and forth on him but other than that he controls amazingly. So many different armor sets and weapons and the armor sets can even offer their own buffs to you for wearing it. You can even choose to have summons on your side to help and they do help tremendously. However if your a souls vet played and beat dark souls 3, bloodborne, sekiro etc any of the other soulsborne games than more than likely having summons with you will make the game to easy. Without summons this game is quite difficult honestly, even with summons some fights can just be made 
harder by them. However you want to play this game has a build for you with an adventure curated just for you on that playthrough. Its time to prepare for the Shadows to overcome the Erdtree we must be ready fellow Tarnished.
you died

yes
Is good
very hard

Es est√∫pidamente largo, y no lo digo positivamente. Tiene much√≠simo contenido, y si bien es cierto que mucho es opcional y podr√≠as saltartelo si eres un jugador m√°s centrado en lo principal como es mi caso, este juego se te va a hacer muy cuesta arriba, ya que los bosses son un abuso y est√∫pidamente complicados si no as con el nivel necesario (que obtienes haciendo todo el contenido secundario). Sin embargo el mundo (menos velo tormentoso) es maravilloso, los combates son √©picos y los personajes muy memorables y chulos.

Everything they say it is.
.
I have sunk almost 400 hours into the game and still enjoy playing it
whatever you f*ckin do.

do not open the chest in the dragonfire ruins.. thing.. when you just start.

That thing's a bullshit softlock for a new player.      Beyond that, its a neat game.


..seriously though FS, the bullshit is part of the soulslike genre but did you HAVE to throw a softlock right out of the very beginning of the game?  ..on a side mention that its only a softlock if you have someone with you with prior knowledge of how that thing functions and how to get out. Otherwise its a straight up hardlock for anyone without bdsm tendencies.
Most enjoyment I've gotten from an rpg since I was 12, playing Oblivion for the first time on 360. Truly amazing game.
great quality sex scenes i recommend for anyone looking for a game like this

Gud Gam :)
I like games that make me want to kill myself üòã
Playing this game at work makes the people who "would never play a FromSoft game because there is no easy mode" ask to play the game while I step out of office for random tasks. The game is amazing, it deserves all of the accolades it has earned. I am very excited for the upcoming DLC!
even if shadow of the erdtree flops, ts is still second only to ds3
first souls game i've played and hands down my favourite game of all time. challenging mechanics, deep and complex, thought provoking lore, lots of potential for replayability with different builds etc and impossibly beautiful scenery and vistas everywhere you go. This game is like stepping into a painting that you have to fight your way out of. 10/10

Best game of the souls series hands down, can't wait for the DLC in June.
Great game.

While this game is rather challenging, a good walk through guide will help players not used to the souls-game-style of gameplay.
Elden Ring offers endless hours of entertainment, 10/10 game for me

1-5 hours - This is sick!
6-10 hours - I am never beating this boss.
11-20 hours - There's so much left to do.
21-40 hours - kms.
51-60 hours - I'm almost finished.
beat the game - Peace.
i broak the eldun ing
good
It really deserves it's title "Game of the year".
t
Best game
It's Dark Souls, but open world. What's not to like?
favourite game, bought it on 3 seperate platforms
Change my mind, the game is awesome, I figured out that I am supposed to go to all the dungeons and shit. Pretty sick game, cant wait for DLC
cool
I have never played a Souls game before. I was afraid I would rage quit and wouldn't enjoy it but the more I played the more it grew on me. I was fascinated by the world sure the enemies were hard and sure I died plenty of times but something kept pushing me forward to not give up. There were moments of anger, frustration but also moments of beauty, and grace. Every boss has its challenges. I kept going with every new area I explored I got stronger with every defeat I learned and adapted. It's not an easy game but if you have patience, determination, and will you can learn to be great. A friend once told me "The game is only as hard as you make it." I couldn't have put it better myself. I loved this game a lot and I highly enjoyed covering it on YouTube with my community. I had no idea what to expect and that's what made it awesome. If anyone is afraid to cover this game or has no previous Souls experience like me this is one experience that will truly change your life. It will challenge the way you think, the way you usually play, and the way you experience games forever. Thank you FromSoftware for making such an amazing game and I look forward to the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.
i love you elden ring. please have my kids.
it good
my god
Game of the year 2022. Any question?
Super fun
Il n'y a plus de mots pour d√©crire ce jeu, ce n'est plus un jeu, c'est un art. Je n'ai jamais jou√© √† un jeu si bon que √ßa, les sc√®nes magnifiques, les aventures m√©morables et les combats √©poustouflants... Sa valeur d√©passe largement son prix, tout m√©rite.
great game. lots of playablity
good

yes
love the swimming capabilities around the edge of the map!
It's worth the play.
wow
So good that I bought this game twice.
Im terrible at it, but i love it. It has so much to explore, so i have plenty of content to complete at my own pace.
Don't usually write reviews for games but I straight up don't want to stop playing. This game is heroin, I'm straight up addicted. This is the only FromSoft game I've gotten all achievements for. Like every game from this developer it's tough, but rewarding. Just buy it.
It's like crack cocaine
I mean its alright, like... overrated as f*** in my opinion
woke up in a cave and 200 hours later i went to space with a blue lady who had 4 arms and could become the moon

Goated
Wow. Just Wow. I love this game. Makes me feel great. Truly a Masterpiece.
Game Gud
At what cost
W
WORTH ALL THE DISK SPACE AND MONEY

good
erm..... it was alright
play this if you want to waist your life
cant play because a white screen crash everytime i launch and theres thousands of fixes apparently but i couldnt find any
emotional pain go brrr
Disgusting and horrific time the entire time, would do again

Can't explain how much I coom over this game
The best game ever

It's the Elden Ring of Elden Ring.
I can collect pretty flowers :D
Oh I love Elden Ring oh thank you daddy Pim
good
Just got it, it's a beautiful game. Already died numerous times but that's what makes it fun.

this game is hard but fun i dont recemend playing it because of its difficulty for new players it might be fun but at the long run its hard stay away from this game if you havent play any dark souls
other than the multiplayer issues, 10/10
yeah i liek it
its ok
So good it caused me to buy and play all the fromsoft games on xbox, playstation, and steam. Souls games are the elite gaming genre. Hands down the best.
I wanted a challenge and this game delivered

If this was a cheesecake, i'd eat it very slowly to enjoy the itty bitty bites of creamy goodness
masterpiece
Best soul's like game ever
Great Game to play though with your partner :)
Sick
yes if u have no life to get on with and spend all ur time on this game then go and get it now
sexy
When I win, it's cause I'm good. When I lose, it's because the game lies and its fuckin bullshit.
i already know ur malenia the blade of miquella ok?
game good, game stressful, game make mad, game make me feel succession
Kolay oyun
great game
I tried it a year ago, hated it. Dumped it after about 30 minutes. Tried it again 6 months later. Now it's my favorite game of all time, and I only have 119 hours played thus far. The game is a complete masterpiece. I only played single-player, pve, but for THAT approach of playing... it's a total masterpiece.
loved it so much i bought it twice
Don't give up when Margit tells you to put your foolish ambitions to rest.
peak game
amazintg
[h1]Is Elden Ring any good?[/h1]

Short answer... [b]YES[/b]

The game though is at times to big and open, and gives people like me decision-paralysation, and unlike all other [i]From Software[/i] games I weren't able to blindly play through the game with no guides or any "[i]builds[/i]" to go for.

The game also suffers from a poor iteration of having "coop" in it, and a friend of mine really wanted me to play this game. So we ended up playing on the "[i]Seamless COOP[/i]" mod, and while the bosses got a lot harder with a bunch of health the challenge was awesome!

[hr][/hr]

The game is good, it's great too. But in my opinion not the best of the "[i]From Software[/i]" games, that title goes to "[i]Sekiro[/i]".
[h2]My Score: 9/10[/h2]
[h3]The game is good, and I'm looking forward to the DLC![/h3]
This Margit guy keeps defeating me...
Aside from not knowing if I'm drinking a potion or riding my horse, I feel like some of the animations could be curtailed a bit to improve immersion. I use an Xbox controller though, so maybe it's just me. Visually the game is unparalleled aside from a competently modded SSE. Hands down some of the coolest boss fights ever.
True gamer game.
Beating bosses felt underwhelming. Too many repeated bosses; I was excited when I read the game had over 100 bosses only to find most of them are either repeated or simply bad (ridiculous spam or crap like dragons where if you're fighting with a sword you see the dragon's bum for 70% of the fight). 

Open world is not only confusing but also a waste of time.

I found myself using a guide for most of the game which made the experience less enjoyable to figure out where everything is.

Good as a first souls-like game for someone maybe. But as someone who played DS1 and DS3 (casually), boss design other than Margit is horrible (still yet to fight Melania and Radagon but I'm nearly finished w the game so even if they turn out to be good, not enough to change my view). The game pushes you to use summons and magic against bosses in many instances through either spawning some difficult NPCs or spamming attacks/abilities (i.e Commander Niall, Draconic Tree Sentinel, Mirriam).

Fall damage is bad: it feels like one jump kills you and torrent while another only takes away a bit. There is no consistency.
i am guts

best game i've purchased so far
I will be maidenless forever
iyi
Incredible in both the graphics and game play but also difficult enough it will drive you insane. (in a good way)
Very good game 10/10 would smash ranni
yes!
If you like BDSM this game is for you
Tried jumping and searching for hidden paths but encountered liars ahead. Offered many to try seed. Found a lot of dogs. I had fun time with many beautiful but holes. I even tried fingers on them. Got my ass beaten by a lot of strong foes, and then I found salvation.. "Seek skill" it said. Malenia got me questioning my sanity but I dit it!! I became the Elden Lord.

Great game.
very good game
Ring
she on my elden till i ring
It's another great game from Fromsoft. Different from other "souls" games but a fun challenge none the less. Huge open world that in some areas (especially at the end) feel a bit empty. I'm about to finish my very first play through, which easily took me over a hundred hours to complete. I'm excited for the DLC.
Amazing game!
pretty easy game would recommend
It's all very opaque and arcane, not always clear what most people are talking about, but you're guided towards your destiny by grace alone. Basically Elden Ring is Lutheranism the video game.
pew pew
good game

try fingers,
but hole
its a good game i guess
so good with seamless coop

This game is very good for people who like a hard yet long game for example on a Xbox save i have over 100+ hours and have not even gotten all the achievements or the games multiple endings
It's like dark souls but most weapons are actually viable and fun to use.
BEST GAME IVE EBVER TRID IN MY LIFE, CHANGED MY VIEW OF FATE IN ITSELF AND OF MY FUTURE, I DONT HOW THIS GAME EXISTS
cool game
dog ahead
hard game
try fingers, but hole
I was shocked by how difficult this game was at beginning, since it was my first soul like experience. But after quite some time of adaptation, I finally started to enjoy all the impressive things the author wanted to present to us. IMPRESSIVE, I mean it. I can't imagine the amount of work and thoughts they poured into this production but I can't have enough thanks. A GREAT GAME, A GREAT PIECE OF ART.
Marika bless the Mimic Tear ashes
Best dating simulator ever.
Boring game waste of money they say its open world so you can do anything no you cant if you try to kill the first boss tree sentinel you will die you are not supposed to kill him so why is he at the start ?? If you can kill him congrats look outside of window if you can walk bcs you are probably build like a piggy you no lifer your next goal is to try to touch grass gl with that. If you are normal person even dark souls fan you need to skip this first boss and try to run around the world to find someone more easy which most likely will cost you a lot of time or you can google it and follow someones path so you can enjoy game(nice freedom I would say) btw boss fights are great they are fun challenging and interesting but running around looking for stupid items or paths to be able to play the game is boring make some arena you pick boss and items and fight thats a dream:D btw every positive review is from someone ho is big dark souls dun even if their game was the worst they would argue that its the ebst game ever and if you wasted that much money on this boring game its normal when people say its good game to feel better :D
you can hug a woman, 10/10
always wanted to play this game but only got my hands on it like 3 days ago, but i have to say, this game is BRUTALLY hard but also the most fun and intricate world i have ever played in. each boss feels like a DANCE, and i have had 19 hours in this game, however only beaten the first major boss. there is so much to do that the main bosses are almost a goal when you have finished that quest, or defeated that enemy that you have been wanting to beat for ages. There is so much to do that you can truly get lost and feel like a part of the elden ring world
Game too hard,,,,, nerf,,,,!!!
pretty good
It is difficult however it teaches a great lesson for games. You can never beat something if you just give up. Simply learn how to do better or take time to figure out how to power up your build. I fully 100% recommend this game.
Amazing open world. Fantastic freedom of how you wish to play.
Best game of all time. Cant wait for the DLC.
suffering ahead
10/10 game
ruff
IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME, then I suggest this game. It is substantially longer than any other souls game I've ever played and any plot significance or map exploration is aimless. There is a tiny bit of a contrived plot, but honestly, I hate the fact that From Software doesn't do any storytelling outside of their basic world building and expendable NPC's. Nothing feels like I'm supposed to care and I just summoned folks to fight stuff for me. 

Aesthetically, I enjoyed the game. I would not have completed it without using the guides on the internet. As such, I really felt like the only true way to play the game is with the mentality you're going to 100% it at least during one playthrough. Then, like BOTW, you may never touch it again.
hard learning but stick through it and its the best game
Great game, you feel really good when you finally beat the boss you were stuck on.
Also i play on keyboard, and i still beat godrick, rennala, margit and radahn.
Heed my words. I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have known defeat.

10/10
i ran a dex build and was nailed to a cross for it 10/10 goty
10/10 From Software doesnt miss
Its elden ring ofc its good
Idk how many times I wanted to break my controller, but it was worth it. Put hair on my chest frfr
I regret not playing this game early...
Oh well better late then never
Sellen feet enjoyer
I've been replaying the campaign in preparation for the upcoming DLC release. Enjoying it just as much as the first time I played, and still finding areas that I missed! 10/10 would recommend.
It's kinda neat
I have not even played this for 10 hours and immediately got addicted. This game offers so much exploration, fighting, looting, literally anything that it is insane. This is good especially for people that like hard and LONG story and open world games. It even has multiplayer! I would honestly recommend this for everyone to check out.
Really enjoyed this game. It's like a game version of a Tim Burton Movie, same artistic style and vibe. The beginning can be quite tough, and you definetely need a controller to enjoy it. But when you learned most mechanics and how the game works with it's quests and so on, I would recommend you to throw away your first character and start a new one, after reaching Farum Azula is a good point, as you've probably missed alot of quests. Then you will definetely enjoy it, and get addicted to the exploration and stuff. It has some Bizarre open world, where you have to thiink outside the box in terms of movement, because it's not on a 2d plane like other RPG as for example Skyrim, but has a more vertikal 3d exploration, where you go up and down, and end up in places, which normally are not accessible in other open world games. Very creative and unique. Death becomes a part of the game, rather than an obstacle. For example if you die in Skyrim, you have to reload a save, and if that save was 1 hour ago, you will have to go and grab all items and stuff, you've collected before again. Here you keep all previous collected stuff, and just respawn at a nearest site of grace. It makes the game more fluent, even when dying.
I don't like this game. I've tried it again, again and again and it just never clicks for me. 
I've tried to validate my feelings by watching lots of review content and replaying older FromSoftware games. 

For the games defense, it got lots of good in it.  It looks great, the world design and monsters etc. are spot on.
The weapons and combat mechanics and different items you can collect to aid you in combat keep the game interesting. I had lots of fun exploring some of the side content in the game.

My major issue with the game is the bosses. Most of the time they are not fun. Most of them punish you too hard from one mistake and barely give you any time to counter attacks. I didn't like cheese bosses from previous FromSoftware titles but this time I feel like they've overdone it. 

Another thing I don't like is that this game isn't great for going in "blind". You'll have bad time without meta builds or guides to find "the good stuff". The game is way too big to not give any directions at all and it's easy to feel just exhausted and not wanting to explore at all. It doesn't really help that lots of content (including mini bosses) are copy-paste content. 

If you are not a speed runner and know all the tricks beforehand, you'll find yourself quite fast being stuck on boss that keeps one-shotting you for hours, days, weeks. 

I'm at that point of the game where I've explored the game enough and I want to "wrap it up" but I can't finish it because I'm stuck on a stupid anime style boss that is way too fast for the player character. 

Why I did give it thumbs up? I guess I've had my moneys worth. But if there will be Elden Ring II with similar traits I won't be as generous.
This is the best game, period.
still maidenless :(
A lot of maidenless behavior
Awesome game!
I'm Malenia, Blade of Miquella and I've never known defeat.
got it to play with mods but i began speedrunning. pb: 3 hours
Strongly recommend. If you are new to these types of games stick through the beginning. It seems pretty pointless when you have no idea what to do and encounter some kind of max level boss around every corner but once you figure out where to go and what to do it‚Äôs a really satisfying experience.
Great game. It's very hard and it pisses me off a lot of times, but I keep coming back for more.
Dog ahead!
Sadly, Elden Ring has a terrible mechanic; the soul fanatics will say it's fantastic, but it's not. 

All Souls games, Dark Souls 1-2-3, Demon Souls, and Elden Ring, have a delayed dodge mechanic. Your character will react 0.25 seconds after you press the dodge button, even if you push it quickly.

This lousy mechanic will destroy all your reactions in other games. You think you become better in other games when you play Souls games, but in reality, you become worse. 

Souls games like Elden Ring give you stupid reactions, like having to roll into a monster instead of rolling from it.

Elden Ring has invincibility frames, which only exist in Souls games. So you will only be good at this kind of game with a messed up controller, and if you do not become crazy about the clunky bad controller like me, then go ahead.

People who say git gud defend a terrible control. No action games except Souls games have this kind of delay, and that is because the devs have done this on purpose to make the game harder. In reality, you trick yourself into believing you will be better at games playing this crap. Every time I play Dragon's Dogma or a game where the controller works and return to these crappy genres called Souls games, I have to learn EVERYTHING again from scratch. Just skip these bad games and focus on games where the controller works.


For those who do not believe this, search YouTube for Elden Ring delayed dodge and see for yourself. This review is not a lie like the Souls fans does.


So why have I given this a thumbs-up? It's because of a YouTuber named 
Thingfishy "How To Dodge-Roll - In-Depth Beginner Guide - Elden Ring"
That is the search words to find his guide.

The delayed dodge can be worked around, but it demands a different view. It is still a bad design; you can make it way better, but Fromsoft seems to be not that good at programming. 

If you learn the mechanic he teaches, you can enjoy the game even with the delayed dodge.
A truly amazing game like its predecessors (Dark Souls). The graphics and animations are vivid and the landscapes as if taken out of a child's fairy tale. The boss difficulty is expected but also fun since the game makes you devise strategies to win and when you actually do the dopamine rush is crazy. Would definitely recommend this to someone who enjoys fantasy oriented games that also pose a challenge for the players ingenuity and skill.
try finger but hole
bueno
Best Soulsborne game ever (except Sekiro maybe )
You can personally experiencing the whole 5 stages of grieves within Elden RIng. If this can't get you play Elden Ring, i  don't know what else will

I love suffering.

hands down best game i ever played
I like it
If you are up to a challenge this is a great rpg game
UWU
Crucible Knight
good
300 hours played still dont know the story of whats goin on....
The game that tried too hard to be the "hardest one". Wasn't balanced from start to finish. You spend most of the game being spammed, one-shot, etc. And if you're going in for the co-op experience; the game actively punishes you for summoning your buddies. Big props for the scope of the game. But there are too many negatives to give the game it's praise.
This game is not for everyone but for anyone who clicks with this game's combat will get hours upon hours of enjoyment. 

Fromsoft really knocked this one of out the park. (it's not perfect, but that's okay)

At worst this game is a little mobs spam heavy some rooms can have up to 20 dudes waiting to touch your butt. As well as a fair share of repeat bosses assuming you're trying to explore and do as much as possible before beating the game. (Playing co-op with a group of 3 will prove tough in the late game due to the co-op modifier that inflates the boss stats)

At it's best Elden Ring is an expansive open world RPG, filled with amazing scenic views which are packed with nooks and crannies that have goodies to find.There are a multitude of weapons ranging from long-swords, short-swords, great-swords, katanas, hammers, spears, whips, pole-arms, bows, crossbows, staffs, seals, etc. which all can provide an engaging combat experience. Not to mention the other fair share of tools such as armour, shields, talismans, magic, incantations(holy magic), weapon skills, spirit summons, co-op summons all in an effort to make you stronger to get you  through your journey in the lands between.

(I've played & Platinum-ed this game on both Steam and PS5)
good
Terrible game, don't play it, really bad, don't recommend
10/10
too expensive for a hide and seek game. fun but not worth the price tag.
Amazing
It's such an amazing game. Challenging but rewarding. it's long but doesn't drag out.
good good goooooood whole game tbh
Very fun. Kinda wish the co-op was what the seamless co-op mod makes it into because that makes the game way more fun to play in my opinion but with or without it very good. Also figured I would put this here for anyone with the same issue I had. If the game takes a very long time to load even to the title screen ( for me it would take like 5 mins or so) and you have a corsair keyboard try unplugging your keyboard before launching not sure why that fixes it but it did for me.
10/10

Foul tarnished, buy this game right now.
best game ever made
27 hours and I have beaten no bosses, a true pro gamer
amazing game for even someone who doesnt like these  souls type games
I'm not gonna lie. I just do not have the time it takes to play this game start to finish. I would much rather some shorter games like the souls series once more.
have this game on console, now i have it for pc 10/10
Eh. It's alright.
After 300+ hours...I guess people should try this game if they have not heard about it yet due to living in another dimension.
This game is for big boys
i hate this game i lost all my runes
gud game
its easy to see how it won goty
Lay these foolish ambitions to rest
This game is beautiful it was a blast playing and exploring 11/10 worth every penny exited for dlc
nice
First playthrough took me around 180 hours to complete. World is massive and stuffed with content.
I simp for the 4 arms blue witch bitch
Very beautiful open world and many bosses to kill, so many challenges, weapons, and much more to do after that, go fight other people, or even play with them and kill all the bosses! You arent getting any spoilers out of me, but it is very fun and hard, so call up your friends and beat the game!
AMAZING GAME EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY
It's good
pretty cool game, wanna play dlc.
Amazing game
GO FORTH AND CONQUER TARNISHED
it is just the best and it toke me to long to play this game

[h1]A brutally honest "Elden Ring" Review: [/h1]

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/

[u]!!! Disclaimer: !!![/u]
This Review is written before the completion of my first ever playthrough of Elden Ring, so I might edit it later and/ or add a few things that were relevant enough for me to add them as I play through the game a few different ways.

This Review will be divided into several categories and rated on ?/10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First up, we got [b][u]The world and its design[/u][/b] (8/10):

The world is beautifully designed, theres many different areas with a wide variety of enemies and minibosses for extra bossitems and/ or useable spells. Many different merchants can be found, caves with bosses to face after finishing exploring them and so called "Churches of Merika" with inhabiting NPCs or items to upgrade ur Estus. The whole map itself is gigantic and must be diclosed by finding map items, which can be found in the associated area. 

For me personally, it was very easy to get lost in the open world, especially since I was used to the Dark Souls games and its rather linear progression system, which lead me to miss out on quite a few minibosses and talismans, not to mention NPCs and their associated questline. So taking all of that into account, I rate the overall world design an 8/10!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, we will take a look at [b][u]The Lore [/u][/b] (7/10?):

I wont get too much into The Lore as to not give away too much about the game, but I was rather intrigued by the cinematic intro. Since I am not a person that gets into the Lore of every game and reads every single item description in order to find out more about whats going on in the game, I can't say for sure what I would rate the lore in context of the other [i]Soulsborne Games [/i]. So I would go with a 7/10(?). 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next and final section of my review with revolve around [b][u]The Bosses and their design[/u][/b], aswell as [b][u]The combat system in general[/u][/b] (10/10, second best I have ever gotten to experience in a [i]Soulsborne game[/i], right after the Bloodborne combat system!): 

Okay, I have [b]alot[/b] to say about [i]Elden Ring's [/i] combat system, so bare with me please! First off, the bosses, their movesets and [b]MOST OF ALL! [/b] their voicelines far surpassed the expectations I had towards this game and are EASILY the single best designed in the entire franchise! 

There are bosses that use [i]Dexterity focused weapons[/i], leading to a moveset that consists of combos that can lead into a flurry of attacks, simply melting your HP down to 0, whereas there are other foes, that have delayed attacks that require you to adapt to their timing. They are quite slow and do not have many tools in their arsenal to dispose of you [u]Lowly tarnished[/u], but they hit like a truck, should you be too slow to get out of their way and dodge effectively! That type of boss trusts in their [i]Strength[/i], in order to hinder you to progress through the lands between. 

The arenas, some bosses can be located and challenged in, may take your breat away simply by how beautifully and fitting they are designed, complimenting their respective boss snd/or area they are located in. BUT FOCUS ON THE TARGET INFRONT OF YOU!

You yourself have many different tools at your disposal in order to reach your goal, with many different paths and classes to choose from. Crafting is a mechanic that debuts in this game, with crafting materias scattered about for you to collect and use to your advantage and give you a slightly bigger chance of beating the opponent you might get stuck on along your journey. 

As I mentioned above, I NEED to give the combat system a perfect rating! But I also said, it was the second best combat system I have experienced so far, right after Bloodborne's. Elden ring is a masterpiece, but I can simply not find the strength to push Bloodborne off of the throne, that is my heart and let Elden Ring take its spot...! I am howeveer curious, wether the DLC might change that fact, so stay tuned, maybe I will upate my Review after playing through the DLC.

Until then, I higly recommend this game as an entrypoint to the [i]Soulsborne Series[/i]. 

Pay the maiden your respects after rating my review, thank you and have a nice day/ night

I hadn't played a souls-borne game before this. I knew I would like the aesthetic, but I didn't know if I would like the actual difficulty and gameplay. There are games you always wish you could go back and experience for the first time again, and this one definitely already is. The game can be confusing on how to progress, which is my biggest gripe with these games, but that's part of what makes the story and game so mystifying. I highly recommend this game.
Man why do I keep falling asleep to Elden Ring Lore videos in my bed. It's like...The sweetest lullaby/ brainwashing...

Anyhow, this game made me use magic for the first time in a souls game so...Well played (:
Behold! Dog!
honestly the game is not bad. the down side is you fight the same bosses over and over again in just one play through making the game stale very quick after you get to NG+
Marikas tits are fire<3
Best game
try finger, but hole
cant stop
good

i hate malania
First FromSoft game ever beaten.  What a ride.
FOUND MY GOAT! USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
Is fun
Try fingers
Good game to play through once or twice but if you don't love it then that's kinda it. has way less replay-ability than the other souls bourne games.
got all achievements twice on ps5 and pc, its one of the best overall digital experiences i've ever had.
i like killing everything i see
Great game. Not up there with DS3 but definitely worth the money.
gg
Every time I thought I was nearing the end, the map just got bigger... A huge world with unique rewards in most of it's nooks and crannies. There are certainly some flaws (like how repetitive the crypts and caves can be) but overall it's a modern masterpiece of the action/adventure genre.
this game might be underrated
upd: ok i actually think this game is overrated now
So good. From software does it again with this super cool super good souls type game. Super fun game with hours n hours of content on top of the main campaign. Challenging but not impossible really fun game. Def with buying it
thumbs up
.
I have never played a souls like game before which made the game really hard and frustrating at first, but after getting killed 1000 times and finally learning the mechanics and game play I have absolutely loved Elden Ring, it is definitely one of my top games I've played and it is well worth the price.
This game scratches that itch that everyone has whether they know it or not. The open world exploring is S tier and the story ingrained into each character is amazing. 634 hours into this game and I am still finding new things. Let's get down to the specifics though

1. SOUNDS:
     The soundtrack is, of course, amazing and fits perfectly with any boss fight or combat in the open world.
     Breaking an enemy's stance is so satisfying.
     Critical striking an enemy feels so powerful. The list goes on because this game is thoroughly fleshed out.
2. BOSS FIGHTS
     "BLADE OF MIQUELLA" tough... but wonderful if you are a masochist.
     These boss fights are some of the most fun and challenging boss fights I have had in a long time.
     As I said earlier, the soundtrack to each boss is amazing and made to fit the lore of each boss.
     When you finally kill a boss you feel so powerful! All up until the easiest npc in the game kills you. 
     The move sets of almost all of the bosses are really cool in my opinion. 
3. GENERAL COMBAT
    Melee combat is at it's peak here. Strategy is a must for the whole game. One mistimed dodge or swing of your weapon could erase the souls your Tarnished vessel tried so valiantly to retrieve. 
    The weapon designs and skills are so much fun. The variety of weapon designs and skills allow for not just overpowering some enemies, but they are also easy to cosplay with. 
4. MAGIC
    I am mostly a tank, damage, and support kind of player so I get some could use out of the support/ buffing spells and incantations. 
    One critique I have is, I do not get nearly the same satisfaction from using damage spells as I  do with a melee weapon. I just feel that the spells are lacking in someway and that could very well just be a me problem.
5. TERRAIN: 
     The locations in and around the Lands Between are beautifully depicted. The trees in Leyndell, the different cultures ingrained into the buildings around the map, the star lit sky of Siofra River and Nokron, everything in this game has so much passion placed into it. 
 6. SUMMARY
     I love this game! I suggest it to anyone I know that has an interest in video games. Currently I am cosplaying Varre. Two Great Knives in hand and plenty of bleed and the blood spells of Mohg. This is probably my favorite cosplay so far. Extremely fun. The variety in ways you can tackle this game really makes it my favorite game by a large margin. 

    BECOME A TARNISHED! JOIN US AND COMMIT THE CARDINAL SIN! OR BETTER YET, BRING CHAOS TO CONSUME THE WORLD!

Best for new Soul Player not to difficult ! Great Game ! Recommended
One of the best games ive played so far
I'm in love with this game:)
love the game, especially when the last boss said "[spoiler]it's eldering time[/spoiler]". best game ever
Ëâ∫ÊúØÂìÅÂïä
Perhaps the greatest game I've ever played. I'd consider myself a souls veteran, I completed DS3 and Bloodborne way back in my teens and in early adulthood, and even as a kid before then I played the shit out of DS1 and a little bit of DS2. I can safely say, under no uncertain circumstances, this is the greatest game which From Software has ever made. A cinematic experience that puts the best of every game before it to the forefront, build variety is off the charts, the bosses are all expertly made, the soundtrack is gorgeous, the game is gorgeous even on lower end PCs, I implore whoever's reading this to at least try Elden Ring. Try tongue but hole, you sexy thing you.
Loved playing as tarnished
very nice
Amazing!
100% WORTH THE PURCHASE! Beautiful game!
Eh its aight
nice
I couldn't get passed the Tree Sentinel..
I kill every turtle I see
.
Good game, well worth its price. Admittedly I've played most of my time in Elden Ring through mods that enables a more seamless co-op experience but that itself breathed so much more life into the game. Exploring its vast open world with somebody by your side just feels right. It's a difficult game for people new to soulslikes but the myriad of options given to you make it much more accessible than FromSoftware's previous entries, making Elden Ring easier to newcomers interested in this style of combat.

8.8/10, very solid and polished game.
no te rindas esqueleto
masterpiece
TREE
Game keeps beating me senseless and I keep coming back for more.
Don't let my hours on record fool you. I have around 200-250 hours of playtime on console. All I have to say is this is one of the best games ever made period.
Play this game and become maidenless.
daf
Just amazing all the way around, art design, music, game play, boss design, some bosses feel a bit cheap but that is probably due to lack of knowledge at least it usually was for me.
Can't refund.
W game.
This game will most certainly make you feel the agony of defeat... until you get good and feel the thrill of victory
it took me a whole year to get an achievement just to get 100%
Best Game to Date
Time to clap melanias scarlet rotten cheeks
good
simply amazing
good
Oh the Erdtree!
if you are unsure about this game if anyone has told you not to get it. IGNORE ALL OF THAT 
this is the second best game i have ever played besides baldurs gate 3. you need to play both but if youre seeing this just get elden ring its so good youll never stop

I fweakin witerally wuv sows gamez
mid
The open world is too big, invasions suck (i never get invaded and found out you only invade gankers and gamers [ppl that pop the tongue]). Other than that it's not bad, i'm sure on repeat playthroughs it's more enjoyable since you'd know where weapons are and the stats you should build towards for them. Also I'm glad Miazaki made L2s and R2s actually good and useful in this game. 
tl;dr: This is dark souls 4 (3, if you don't count ds2) with an open world.
perfection as a video game
yes

Insane world!  Just beautifully built and the combat as always on point.  Variety in enemies and incredible vastness as well as some magic, crafting and weapon customisation make this a no-brainer.
Pain.
Amazing
Perfection
if you had to refund this game, yes, yes you are trash
fun, but too easy
Good Good Game i love u and hate u at the same time
yeppers
Masterpiece.

You know who else's 3rd favorite game is Elden Ring? MY MOM! WOOOOOOOHHHHHHH
the lore is a religion jfc

maidens are overrated
Incredible game, and easily the most forgiving game From Soft has put out.
This game is great at humbling me.
Never played any souls like games before.  This was honestly something else.  I had such a great time with this game along with some of the heaviest rage moments I've had in a while. Worth every penny and am ready for the DLC!
Once you get going and find the right build it is a blast, but find something that works for U!!!!
pebis
Elden Ring is a great game! The seamless coop mod is really fun to play with friends and build cool characters!

I beat pre-patch Malenia at level 109 with +9/+3 weapons, and it only took 15 hours across 3 days, Black Knife Tiche, and the bug that makes her not regain all her health in the second phase.
big chungus
The Best ActionRPG of all time IMHO. Not a big fan of Dark Souls itself, but this game is different as a well done fun to explore open world, no handholding and having a mount makes this game a lot of fun. Buy it, but don't give up if the first strong enemy kills you. Just avoid them, till you get stronger. You can always go somewhere else, there's always other areas you can explore

pretty good game
its a soulsborne so if you liked the dark souls series you'll probably like this aswell
definetely has some balancing issues and the pvp lag is a bit annoying sometimes but otherwise a solid 8/10
would recommend
(btw fuck the godskin apostle in the caelid divine tower
Awesome game, truly riveting and  I must say, it is rather delightful
I love Elden Ring, it's strong story, music, gameplay, and community, has all created a gorgeous game. The game itself is such a nice breather from the stale state of online multiplayer games.
BAD GAME CANT SEX ANY BOSS

One of, if not THE greatest games I've ever played. Rich open world, challenging bosses, and tons of things to use and do. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who wants a new game to suck their life away.

PS: I am Malania, Blade of Miquella
good game cant stop playing it tbh
Perfection
great game
Nothing to say really, people who downvote this game are wrong and their opinion is invalid. Those people should not be alowed to vote ever again.

This game is peak. In which other game can you marry smurf witch with 4 hands?
Best game since sliced bread.
what am i doing with my life? the dlc is months away i dont need to be playing this much
I refunded Elden Ring after about an hour and half of playing.  As new players to Elden Ring, me and a friend grouped up to play together only to have no way of stopping others from joining our game, through invasions, and killing us.  I understand that the levels are balances, but it seems like game play experience is not.  Someone with hundreds of hours experience can create a new character and farm newbies, multiplayer griefing at its worse.

If you want just a single player, or enjoy indeterminate unbalanced PVP, you will probably enjoy this game.
NEHIL! NEHIL!! NEEHILL!!!
Yes
Yeah, I am not masochistic enough to enjoy any type of souls game. Was told Elden Ring was easier than other souls type games, but difficulty is still stupidly high, I dont have enough time to "get gud", I will stick to other games. At this point I think people only like this game to boost their ego. I downloaded wemod, maxed out my character and still find everything stupid, although i can actually kill enemies now. If you are looking for a game that looks great, and is stupidly hard then this is the game for you. If your looking for a fun single player RPG I do not recommend this game, it just isnt fun
Every once in a while, a perfect thing is made.
I was playing offline so it shows 34 hours for some reason but I did finished the game and it took lot more then 34 hours :D. At the beginning its bit overwhelming, then becomes fascinating when you realize how vast and giant this world is and you start exploring it. I do have to say that towards the end I just wanted to finish the game, it was bit too long for me specially with bit repetitive "you found the cave with closed door that lead to mini boss, but you have to explore the cave to find lever that opens this door, then kill mini boss, get reward". Repeat for each cave/mine/catacombs. I can see they were trying make it different but there are mini bosses that are repetitive and after some time it became more like a job then entertainment. Overall though it is a solid game and I can easily recommend it.
good
Say 2 fingers and no one bats a eye. Say 3 Fingers AND THE LANDS BETWEEN. THE LANDS BETWEEN LOSES THEIR MINDS
Easily up there with the top ten games of all time.
Died a couple of times. Beautiful game that is overall very entertaining. On the occasion you don't die, it is very satisfying. I would recommend giving it a try.
Good
Can't wait for the 7 hour long, button-mashing sex scene with Messmer the Impaler in Shadow of the Erdtree

worth it
hell yeah

"Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings."

I'm new to souls-like games and I've been avoiding Elden Ring all this time, until one day I decided I wanted to give it a try...
100+ hours later, playing this game everyday, and dreaming about it at nights instead of sleeping like a normal human being, it's safe to say it got me hooked, duh.
I've never seen a world THIS rich, with so many places to explore (both seen & hidden), so many different enemies to fight in each location you go. 
The Lands Between are gorgeous and disturbing at the same time, some enemies & NPCs I've met, gave me chills down my spine. 
The boss fights are absolutely insane, I loved almost every single one of them! 
The story has left me in ruins, it broke my heart into pieces, but it was absolutely worth it.
Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece and the best game of this decade, no one can convince me otherwise.

the biggest let down in this entire game is [spoiler] not seeing which hand the tarnished chose. [/spoiler]
20 hrs. i haven't even beaten Godrick.
Not that hard.
Phenomenal game, can't praise it enough.
Best game I've ever played
great game
ELDEN RANG
its alr
TLDR ; Dear devs please enhance PC keybinds

I haven't finished the game yet.  So far an easy 4/5 

As a PC only (no controller) player the game takes a big L in regards to Keybindings.

- Roll , backstep , and dash are on the same key . which tbh it doesn't make any sense
- Camera controls , it might be just me but i dont feel comfortable in any shape or form , i've been playing araound with the provided settings and it;s just gets awfull.
- The keybinds should be always optional ,  this game removes the ability to do so . And btw this is an easy fix for the developers it should not take much time

 

It is one of the greatest games of all time, enough said.
ELDEN RING OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH ELDEN RING!
 [h1] Fromsoftware's Magnum Opus [/h1] 

Thank you, Miyazaki.
meh
win GOTY for a reason
Incredible looking open world with a good game play loop.

Compared to the other FromSoftware titles if you're struggling it is nice to be able to go and do something else in the world for a while!
yes.
My first time playing a full Souls-like game and what an epic entry. The first 15 hours were brutal, constantly dying until you learn the combat system. Any bosses or enemies I couldn't kill I came back to after farming and exploring.

The art work is incredible on 2K or 4K settings.

If you don't like difficult games then stick to Diablo, otherwise highly recommend.
yipi
You've heard it before, right? If you're going to play a Fromsoft game, be prepared to die, and die often.
The challenge in playing these games isn't about how to stay alive, but in making sure that you're learning from each death. Understanding the enemies' different attacks, understanding the movements of your own character, learning exactly how to move and where to stand so that you can both stay alive and pressure the opponent--none of these skills will come in a day. But it will be incredibly satisfying when it comes.
Best fromsoft game to date
Absolutely, undoubtedly the greatest game of all time.  There is non that come before nor will there be any to come after that which will exceed the greatness of the masterpiece known as the "ELDEN RING"!!!!!
9/10 I learned how to get good from this game. Thank you Mizayaki
I bought this on launch and still haven't beaten it.
This is the first dark souls game. I really liked it. Only thing is that it got a little bit stale after a while but definitely worth it.
An unforgettable experience.
It does is a masterpiece. Rich game mechanics, tons of possibilities... A game tha allows you to play it your own way. The main downside here is that it causes huge FOMO everitime you need to choose how to develop your character, weapon, etc...
The game is hard and may be frustating. But there are work arounds for that. You may either play with some friends to help you with bosses, or give up the great online experience and install the Easy (or the very easy version) mod. Despite the name, it still won't make the game easy, but at least way less frustrating...
One Of The Best Singleplayer games of all time the multiplayer is kinda mid tho
Mostly good game. Malekith is aids though
This is not a game, it's an experience. Enough said
If you're on the fence and never tried a "souls" type game before, this is an excellent start.  I was hesitant and now I believe it to be the best video game so far.  So much fun and such a rush of a challenge.  The difficulties are what make it fun.
Best game
Burn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.

Ahhh, may chaos take the world!

MAY CHAOS! TAKE! THE WORLD!
I never would have imagined that I can beat a souls game in my life, but I did lol. Definitely one of the best games ever.
AMAZING GAME, EVERYTHING TOP TIER, MY FAVOURITE GAME OF ALL TIME
gorgeous.
Good game to play in a day

I got all the Achievements at like 330 hours, after I had beaten the game multiple times. I have a mod for this game but I just haven't played it since the base game is just so good.
Amazing Game.
one of the best games i have ever played
PEAK

Should get game of the year ... every year.
amazing
"...As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri. I hope you can make your peace with that."
yeah booooy
i love dying 300 times to the same boss in a row
still better than valorant
gg
amazing but i wish there was an easy mode with trackers for quests cuz its too inaccessible
Beware, Tarnished!
Elden Ring is notoriously difficult. Enemies hit hard, and bosses are punishing tests of skill. However, the game respects your time, offering multiple paths to progression and rewarding exploration. Difficulty never feels unfair, and overcoming a seemingly insurmountable foe is incredibly satisfying.
pretty good might play some more :)
One of the best games I've ever played. The world design is striking. The weapons are fun and the bossfights are some of the best. Obviously it has its flaws, but every game has those. 
I cannot recommend it enough for anyone that wants to try the whole "soulslike" genre.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends FromSoftware's signature challenging gameplay with an expansive open world. The rich lore, intricate world design, and freedom to explore create an immersive experience that keeps players engaged for countless hours. The game's stunning visuals and atmospheric music further enhance the epic adventure, making it a must-play for fans of action RPGs.

Easily the best soulslike I've ever played. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a challenge.

You can probably already tell what I think of this game by my playtime, but regardless, the game has an amazing amount of content, easily 120 hours per playthrough if not more depending on your own speed.

Elden Ring is a game that, despite its open world nature, strips out much of the bullshit found in other open world games and delivers a great, tightly-controlled and combat-focused experience. In addition, many weapons in the game possess their own unique identities with things such as move-sets, weapon ranges, special moves, etc. to consider; there are very few pure stat upgrades to be found between weapons and armor, and only a few for talismans, just about every item in the game is viable for a playthrough. Would highly recommend, especially with the DLC on its way.
great game, no wonder this is GOTY!
so good after 300 hours
fav game fr:D
I haven't seen the sun in a long while

MUAJUAHUAHUAHAUHAUHUAHAUHAUA
One of the masterpiece, one of the best rpg games i have played. all 100 hrs. i have heard is "I AM MALENIA BLADE OF MIQUELLA"
Phenomenal fucking game. Wish I didn't waste so much time on others and just played souls games like this instead all my life.
I haven't played a lot of Elden Ring so far and I also am kinda late to the game but with all things considered I am BEYOND! impressed with this game, I have never played a souls game and I'm still confused on certain things but I think that's also the joy of the game. You don't instantly know what to do, you have to take your time, explore and learn which adds to the open world adventure feel. The bosses so far vary, from being quite easy to seeming impossible (AT FIRST) but then after dying over and over and trying to remember their attack patterns, timing etc you finally master them and beat it like a piece of cake and you find yourself shaking in relief but also achievement after completion on the mini milestone. With that being said the game is 100% not for everyone and if you aren't up for a challenge then DO NOT! get this game. The visuals are also outstanding and I've enjoyed every bit of it! :)
Worst From Software game ever
goog
Amazing

i run at half a frame per second cause my laptop has 5 bitcoin miners on it but other than that the game is really fun
Great game!
easiest game ive played so far. not even gonnna lie about that one. no i did dnot use cheates
good game
I think it's pretty good.
very good game 

Bloodborne remains the favorite for me, but, damn if it isn't extremely close.
one of the best fromsoft games ever made. So good i beat it once on my old ps4 and paid 130$ to play it and dlc again on my new pc
great game
good game
Oye weally weally like this gaem caus its weally cool. Der gaem difficulty is purrfectly balanced which is quoit difficult to pull off wen it coems to gaems in genewal. Very rare is a game so challenging yet not obnoxiously fustrating, so kudos to fomsoft. The feewing of claarting a difficult boss is awesom and scratches my brian just rite. Very nois ! ^.^
the game is great, but it seems to me that after this experience I have forgotten how to have normal and healthy communication with real people.
After 200+ hours I think I can safely say I really don't like this game anywhere close to the older souls games. Not that I hate it, only that it fails to make me want to play it more. I would recommend literally any of the other Souls games over this one 90% of the time. I am not saying this game is bad, only that I would recommend playing literally all the other souls games first. Leaving this one as the "I have no other Soulsborn games left to play" option. I feel like those games are more cohesive experiences that are far more focused in their design than Elden Ring.

I can play the older games any time I want without feeling lost or frustrated. If I want to play Elden Ring I am stuck playing the same handful of meta builds or risk making the game pure frustration. If I want to not lose track of what I was doing, I can't go to long without playing or I forget what I was doing or where I was in a quest line. There is a reason the open worlds this game is supposedly better than, use checklists and quest logs. Because there is to much stuff that without them you would lose track of it all. Checklists are not inherently a bad thing. But I'm not a smart enough person to fully elaborate on the nuance of that statement. No. Sadly I'm a dummy.

But a big part of what I think the problem is comes down to the game's big open world. Outside of a few exceptions it is very forgettable. A blending of the typical environments you expect to see in a souls game, only with the endless repetition of a generic open world. The best areas of the game are the ones with a much smaller scale. Like the legacy dungeons or the smaller open sections like Siofra River or Nokron. Open, but more structured like the classic games. These places make all the repetitive little side activities feel so out of place. They feel straight out of the generic open world playbook. Just because they are not marked on your map as a checklist doesn't mean they aren't generic copy paste busy work. These side activities designed to pad out playtime and create the illusion of extra content. 

What is the difference between fighting a unique boss, enjoying it, and fighting it again either by putting down a summon sign to help another player, or just fighting it again NG+  compared to fighting the same boss 3 times in 2 different dungeons and 1 time in an evergaol? Some trinkets at the end of each dungeon? Some trinkets that could have just as easily been sprinkled through the legacy dungeons in more densely packed interconnected secrets. You know, like the souls games were well loved for in the first place?

Half the, crypts, evergaols and mines could have been cut with no loss to the game's feel. Removing them might have even made the game feel better instead of padded with pointless busy work. They look the same, they feel the same, and all their bosses are copy pasted the same. None of it feels special anymore. Worse than that they rob other moments that might have been special of the chance to be special. I'm certain I'm not alone in seeing a boss in a crypt or evergaol, or even just as an open world boss. Then fighting them thinking that was a pretty mid boss, then seeing where I was supposed to encounter that boss for the first time and the "Wow factor" of that moment was ruined by previously encountering them as a generic boss. Open world doesn't mean better. It just means a lot of empty connecting space, with a need to fill it somehow. And what they filled that space with is copy pasted and generic. 

Moving from one topic to another, as I don't want to get hung up on one point for to long; I haven't even begun to talk about some of the games most notorious difficulty spikes. Though honestly I don't plan to. People smarter than me with more skill than me have made far more compelling arguments for and against the difficulty than I ever could. To the point that my voice wont lend anything constructive to the conversation. All I will say is that I never could beat Melenia. And at this point, I don't care. I don't need to give myself the headache trying when the reward for beating her isn't worth it. Especially since half the game's community seems to mock katana weapons as noob crutches. Despite us having had over a decade with this format of game some still can't seem to just let people play the way they want to without having to make a fuss about it. And yes I know mimic tear bends her over its knee. But I want to beat the boss. Not watch the AI do it. If you want to just call it a "skill issue"? Fine, I don't care. My sanity is worth far more than an imaginary video gamer e-peen, that no matter how big you think yours is, still wont get you any maidens.

All in all I am left feeling very much confused. Because on the surface I should love this game for being just "Bigger Dark Souls." But I don't. Maybe if they removed all the copy paste boss encounters that rob each unique fight of their memorability. Maybe if they focused more on the legacy dungeons that felt like fun and worthwhile challenges of exploration rather than just big open space, each location would feel more memorable. Maybe if they spent less time worrying about making the game hard for experienced players and just made it on par with previous titles, the meta wouldn't be so restrictive. Maybe if all these things had come to be I wouldn't have ever even cared enough to try and put my thoughts to text, and I would have just put another 200+ hours in without a second thought to the YES/NO recommendation button.

I wanted to love this game. I wanted to love it so much. But I am left disappointed. I see Elden ring as a good game. But one that had it just a little more restraint would have been infinitely more enjoyable for me. But it seems like it has lost focus on what originally drew players like me to these games in the first place. All in favor of the mass appeal that the open world tag seems to draw in. So with that we get to the ultimate YES/NO decision I had to make. I don't like the generic "YES/NO" review system on steam. So I try to answer it with an entirely personal question. Since I know I can only ever speak for myself. 

I ask myself, "If I were talking to my past self would I recommend the game to me? Or would I just like my time back?". Then hit YES or NO based on that. Not as some objective statement to the game's quality. It wasn't an easy decision to come to. I didn't enjoy my time with this game. No matter how many hours I sat through trying to tell myself that I did. Or that it just wasn't clicking with me yet. If you loved it, than all I can say is that I wish I felt the way you did. Maybe someday, I'll come back to it and my thoughts will be different. But until then. Have fun playing the games you love. And never let anyone tell you that they way you feel about a game is "Wrong".
This is currently the greatest game of all time. I previously held Bloodborne as my best game but Elden Ring has improved on every aspect of their previous games. It added everything fans wanted, better bosses, more interesting settings, beautiful visuals, hard as balls boss fights and build flexibility that is rarely seen in games. 

I love this game and wish I could go back and play it again blind that's how good the experience was. I mourn for anyone who does not give this game a fair shot, once you get past the difficulty its the most enjoyable experience I've ever had gaming. 

Also.... Malenia f* you that boss is so hard
Destroy Bird. Absorb power. Rule Ring.
Elden Ring is a fun, beautiful game that's not for the easily infuriated, and it's even more so with the Seamless Co-op mod, but a significant chunk of its masterfully created hours upon hours of content are easy to miss by failing to find some random portal tucked into a corner or some random wall that's for some reason secret. 
Its class system is similar to most class systems found in videos games: it adds replayability by locking content behind class walls.
In addition, the unbalanced nature of certain weapons as compared to others makes most of the loot even within any given class worthless, as the damage of any given weapon most likely pales in comparison to the damage of the weapon you currently have. This holds true for incantations and sorceries, as although this incantation looks really cool, it still only does 90% of the damage of this other spell that functions in the exact same way.
The keyboard and mouse support feels horrid as the player is forced to rapidly press buttons to get to incantations or items, as compared to hotbars or hotkeys found in other games. Furthermore, the unoptimized nature of the game leaves users of high resolution or high refresh rate monitors with a sub par experience.

Overall it's a good 8.25/10. It's a bad port of a brilliant game that feels just barely underpolished.
A classic.
the only real grip i have is the state of pvp there are other issue but we will get to those.
so many things are just unbalanced for example twin spears rip thru your opponent dealing 1000 dmg in one attack
they can roll catch light rolls perfectly because of how long the attack frames last and the range they have
is just bonkers.

id say this game is by far my favorite game right now it offers so much for the price and the replay value is more than you would think however after 3 or so playthrus you may end up using grand merchant or cheat engine as a quality of life because it takes so long to make a build naturally 

the game is well paced over all and tends to push you in the right direction  overall 
the exploration and atmosphere are amazing
the combat is next lvl at times but a fair amount of bosses are reskins with not enough lore to to back up the reasoning for their existence and some bosses end up as regular enemies like in previous titles 
coming back to the lore its everything one could hope for in a fromsoftware game 
also the community is great overall even with the funny gamers pointing you down after they beat you during lag and their shitty internet connection and all that

id give it a 8.9/10 im sure the dlc will bring it up to a 9.5 
its well worth the price and i hope to see you fellow tarnished in the next patch
mmm
I liked it when something other than me died

GRET GAME
truly one of the games of all time
found 3 fingers and everyone called me crazy, 10/10
Easily as strong recommend. The standard Soulsbourne difficulty combined with the open world format give the game almost endless replay value. You easily get your money's worth with a single playthrough. The environmental storytelling of this game is out of this world, and there are plenty of deep, nuanced and complex characters. A few criticisms that I have would be the fact that the game repeats bosses too often, in a few cases recycling repeat bosses as basic minions in later dungeons. There's too often a reliance on using multi-boss fights and it feels to me like a cheap trick to artificially inflate the difficulty.

Seriously don't know why this game is so highly rated. What is so fun about getting your ass kicked a thousand times? I can't do damn near anything in this game.

Have about 600+ Hours on Xbox swapping over to steam and restarting made me love this game all over again. I am absolutely enjoying my complete fresh start! I can say with a smile on my face that I am having a blast as if playing it for the first time again aside from knowing the location of the things I know I want to use for my first play-through on PC :)
good pood in
Its an overhyped big puddle of water. Very wide areas you can step in with zero depth. You better start enjoying fighting multiple bosses 10 times and do anime moves while avoiding the garbage PvP system. Every Boss has a similar name, thanks to George R.R. Martin the King of Iwillneverfinishmybooks. The performance on PC was/is bad (oh yea I did not forget).

Its a fine game, its just one of the worst souls like games from FS. Ds2 might even be better than this one.
im like tyes my friend blake bad he no like my lover love dis he insaen ahhhh

Endless 'fun'
At first, the challenge of this game seems like its biggest detriment, especially if you haven't played a Soulslike before. But as you progress, the ingenuity of the game design becomes apparent as the choices you make hold an increasing impact on not only your playstyle but how the story comes to a close. Everything about the gameplay loop comes together to present a highly-rewarding experience where every victory feels like an accoplishment. 10/10 best game I've played
Epic RPG
Finger But Hole
2nd favorite game ever
died twice on tutorial
died 30 times on my first Tree Sentinel because I have ADHD to do everything perfectly and refusing to roll dodge. 
and if I didn't parry him perfectly, I don't want to progress because the bosses would be harder than him.

probably a good game but it would be too frustrating for me to complete it.

Best game ever...
This game is a game where if you truly wish to become something larger than yourself, you might be able to.  Elden Lord is a title only few capture.  I recommend giving it your all.  Goodluck, friend.
Malenia took like 30 of the 50 hours I have on this game 10/10
Elden Ring is the perfect Souls Game. The difficulty of the game is totally up to you, you can oneshot most bosses if you know how to or you can have an epic long fight with a weaker build in comperisson. Magic Builds, Strengh Builds, Dexterity Builds, Bleed Builds, Faith Builds, Incarnations, Summons etc. are all viable und fun options while you discover new places for hours on end without ever wanting to put your eyes away from the game¬¥s beautiful sights and complex structures. Everything you can see in the distance is actually something you can travel to in 90 Percent of the time which is incredible. The Game let¬¥s you progress the game at your own pace and you could be done with the game in like 20 to 30 hours probably but trust me you dont want to skip all the fun ahead. ^^

One of my most favorite souls game, hope to see more like this in the future
Better than Dark Souls 2
oh shit i forgot to rate this absolute masterpiece of a game
Great game
dog
This isn't even normally the kind of game that I like to play but I enjoy this one very much.
The combat system is very detailed and nearly every weapon feels unique to use and wield.
I like how you can progress to use both spells and weapons if you level high enough.
The story is rich enough but doesn't bog you down with conversation.
Wonderful beautiful world to play within.
I seldom go back to a game once I move on to something else but this game I keep going back to and enjoy continuing to progress.
I've mostly been trying to defeat all the bosses myself, that takes a lot longer.  I have helped others to see what the multiplayer system is like.  It is quite good I just generally prefer to win by myself.

Prepare to embark on an epic journey through a sprawling world filled with danger, mystery, and more deaths than you can shake a sword at ‚Äì welcome to "Elden Ring," where every demise is just another opportunity to laugh in the face of danger!

FromSoftware has done it again, delivering a game that's equal parts challenging and ridiculously entertaining. As you step into the shoes of the Tarnished, a lowly outcast with a knack for getting into trouble, you'll quickly discover that the world of "Elden Ring" is not for the faint of heart. But fear not, brave adventurer, for every defeat brings with it a valuable lesson ‚Äì or at least a hilarious anecdote to share with your friends.

The gameplay in "Elden Ring" is as addictive as it is punishing, with tight controls and precise combat that will put your skills to the test. But don't let the constant barrage of enemies and environmental hazards get you down ‚Äì after all, what's the point of slaying a giant dragon if you can't do it in style while wearing a ridiculous hat?

Speaking of style, "Elden Ring" offers a staggering amount of customization options for your character, allowing you to create a truly unique hero who's as fashionable as they are formidable. Want to wear a suit of armor made entirely out of cheese? Go for it! Prefer to wield a weapon that's actually just a rubber chicken in disguise? The choice is yours!

But perhaps the true beauty of "Elden Ring" lies in its world-building, with a rich and immersive lore that's just waiting to be discovered. From ancient ruins shrouded in mystery to quirky NPCs with stories to tell, there's always something new and exciting to uncover around every corner ‚Äì assuming you can survive long enough to find it, that is.

In conclusion, "Elden Ring" is a challenging adventure that will keep you coming back for more, even when you're face-down in a puddle of your own defeat. So grab your sword, polish your sense of humor, and prepare to laugh in the face of danger ‚Äì because in the world of "Elden Ring," death is just another opportunity to respawn and try again!

HUGE Game, for price of cosmetics. You need to play it!!!!!!
Fire game. The world is amazing, and boss fights are pretty good. Except fire giant. $$$$ him.
gud
yeah
good but overhyped and not as perfect as everyone wants to say it is.
have been playing for two weeks straight, but its was worth it. too much stuff to get over with but still happy to got the game.
Masterpiece
Great trials produce great satisfaction when overcome through hard work and dedication. 

Except in Elden Ring. here beating a boss has you panting with relief just to die to the new enemies in the area you just unlocked because you're probably under-leveled and have no idea where to go next (unless you use an online guide because honestly, in Elden Ring, even a straightforward path sometimes has quite a few loops and secrets to it that you have to figure out otherwise you'll spend an hour just trying to figure out how to exit or bypass an area only to find out your only way back or forward is a single doorway that you've passed 4-5 times while constantly being attacked by, and dying to, the area's inhabitants.

10/10 would recommend (but be sure to bring your big boy pants because even an endgame build can be quickly overwhelmed by basic enemies)

i cant deny that the bosses are very fun and challenging but i cannot deal with the nonexistent directions in the game yea its realistic and makes sense but my god is it not good for gameplay i only really had fun with the multiplayer mod makes the game much more fun
Just a hella good game
11/10
I hate Souls-like games, but this game is something different. 100 hrs+ on Xbox and I still can't get enough.

P.S. This game is not compatible with widescreen monitors and is locked at 60 fps. Maybe third-party modes will help you ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
What an epic. ! yes
best game
In the conversation for best game of all time.
swag game if you dont mind purposely letting it make you go mental. to go even more mental dont use summons.
Great game. Fun time exploring and challenging boss fights!

My son recommended DS3 after I was first introduced to souls games with Lies of P.  I was not disappointed.  Then he said, "If you like DS3 you'll love Elden Ring."  He was not wrong!  This game is phenomenal and massive.  Highly recommend.
half that time was on malenia
Absolutely top tier game, made me go back and get FromSoftware's catalog of games to fill my time until the dlc comes out.
Absolutely amazing game, If you're wanting to get into souls games this one is the perfect start

come on... it's elden ring
It's ight
Still maiden-less...
Pretty Decent game tbh, After playing all shitty games on steam. This lives upto the hype Game of the year hell yeah. Valve DEV should actually learn from them
very hard, even harder than my dick

you wont ever stop playing ever.
one of my favorite games
OUUUUUOH ELDEN RING
best game
Duh, amazing!!!
When I opened up this game I got hard asf. First time seeing the title screen it made me HARD ASF. Fighting first boss, HARD ASF. This game is HARD and made me HARD. 10/10 From music to hidden story.
Changed my life.
One of the best games ever!
Very fun
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.
One of the coolest games I've played and I have never played dark souls.
why no sex
Goated with the sauce,
this game has murdered my social life, buried it, and pissed on it. 10/10 would recommend. Mr. Michael Zaki is a fucking genius.
I got 1860 elden ring hours, I play with just one character at NG plus 26. Yes

Something incredible ahead,
in short Try Elden Ring

yup
best game
Another one of the From software greats. Hours to spend with limitless builds to discover, different styles of play. One hell of an engaging world to explore and more to come with DLC shortly approaching.
although some parts of this game makes me want to rip my hair out its solid 10 and it deserved game of the year
I like when my attacks do big smack and feel good. 
I not like Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
You won't like her either.

My 200+ hrs was over two runs (80 for my first) and my second was doing my best to find all the things without to much googling. I don't usually do side content but this was super enjoyable and being able to re-stat reasonably early in the game makes finding cool new things that I can't use, usable. I started as Melee and re-statted into magic after I found some cool spells.

Definitely an easier souls game but it's super satisfying.
OOOOOOOOO
Game is awesome. Whats more to say.
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis... was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians... to create... life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about... from dying.
He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was... losing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

Melania isn't that hard
It's been a week and I'm in pain. Now that sounds like fun.
9.9/10              Delete Fire Giant
Game is good, boss is bossing, game is gaming, would recommend

It was so hard at first.. but then i became the ELDEN LORD
way too hard 5 me. good game though from what i played
9/10
one of the best games of all time
Perfection
10/10
Spent 80 hours on my first save file. Came back 2 years later and put in 54 hours in a single week. Still excellent.
I finally finished this game, after 83 hours of play, that's 2 months!
Definitely one of the games of all time
While the game has some weak points, the overall product is still absolutely stellar. It's the only game of its kind, that properly scratches that open world, swords & sorcery itch.
goodÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
I prefer the combat in Sekiro to this.
Masterpiece of exploration, lore and combat.
Best of every Souls game and even more on top (game has flaws ofc, but they will be ignored)
bhh
w
I've owned this game for a couple of years and just now got into playing it. The experience has got me regretting not playing Elden Ring earlier. The visuals, the soundtrack and most of all the storyline are all amazing and I have not even finished the game yet. Big thumbs up for this one. 

Keenly waiting for the DLC to come out.
Masterpiece!
Bought this never playing a souls game before, This could be one of the best games that exist.
no
Great Story!
Best Game Ever 2k hours on console and on pc 300 hours
Peak
deserved game of the year. also maybe i like to suffer but 10/10 for me
just to good
love it
I typically rate games on how much playtime I get out of it. Usually $1 per hour of game play is perfect. $0.50 per hour isn't terrible either. You could spend 100s and 100s of hours on this game and still not have explored everything and fought everyone. This game really keeps on giving and I can't wait for the DLC to come out. This game could have easily been $200 when it came out and I could argue that it was worth it. Same thing with DS3.
Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame. Until all is One again.
Try finger but hole
Intresting game but hard as fuck might make u break ur setup
gaming
Biased review, challenging and fun game, if you like Berserk you will love this game.
no runess
SUPER NEAT GAME, WITH BIG SWORDS, SMALL SWORDS, CURVED SWORDS, AND STRAIGHT SWORDS. MORE DOORS, THAN 4 DOORS, ELEVATORS AND PORTALS, TARNISHED AND MORTALS. DRAGONS AND OMENS BUBBLES FROM SNOWMEN. ITS GOT MAGIC, AND ROT,  N BLIGHT AND WHATNOT. YOU CAN FIGHT FROM ONE SPOT WITH A WAND AND SLICK SHOTS. RENALLAS GOT MOONS, FLOWERS THAT BLOOM, ASHES OF WAR, THE BLASPHEMOUS SWORD. THE CAPITAL CITY, YOU STILL FOLLOWING WITH ME. YOU CAN TAKE BLOOD LOSS FROM A DUD BOSS YOU CAN GO IN A CAVE AND FIND A TAILSMAN AND SOME MOSS. I BEAT IT ALREADY AND ILL BEAT IT AND LAUGH, WHEN A TARNISHED BE SLANGING THAT METEOR STAFF.

Overrated but still good. Combat is amazing and so are the weapons and armour but the open world is so BORING TO EXPLORE SO PLEASE JUST LET ME GET TO THE BOSS FIGHT AHAAHAWYUDGAYWGDYUWDG.  BTW your gonna need a yt video guide for most of this game, not because its hard but because you have to do a whole satanic pagan ritual to play with your friend. I mean that in the most literal way possible btw. 

Also this is secretly a berserk game/.
Very hard, but learnable, immersive world that still surprises me after almost a hundred hours, and the most fun I've had gaming in years.
WORST GAME EVER FOR PVP!!! 30 years ago! an amazing game but they are too cheap to provide servers and the peer to peer is the absolute worst experience ever for PVP! It's like you are on dialup 30 years ago... they don't even set the game up to even try to match you with someone with good latency it's  like they purposefully pair you with people on the other side of the planet!!!!!!! They don't fix glitches and i think it is on purpose to keep children interested in the game so you get 1 shotted by a chainsaw glitch when the person is a 50 yards from you!
this is just like the hit trilogy "Lord of the Rings"!
The perfect dating-sim. 10/10, would recommend.
fun
I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E
Be old like me (50+), take your time, relax, explore, leave the bosses until you are way overleveled.
Don't read guides, explore every nook and cranny.  
I haven't even killed Margit yet, I'm only level 36, and I'm having fun.  
This game is look a gentle music to relax yourself with, it's beautiful in a way Skyrim only wishes it could be.
This is my retirement game. It may take me a year or more to explore and finish it all, and I am ok with that.

[h1] [b] This game is absolutely goated!! [/b] [/h1]

This is my first souls game, fell in love with it immediately. Bought this game during sale, never regretted it. My best game purchase so far.
Arguably one of, if not, the best game Souls game FromSoftware has ever created. For those who are hesitant to get into the Dark Souls/Sekiro/Bloodborne-like games, I would recommend starting here. The game has SO MUCH content its actually shocking. The world of Elden Ring is vast and diverse with various different enemy and boss types. The game is difficult, like all souls games, but its by no means unfair. One of the positives this game offers that many souls games do not is the opportunity to level yourself through mini-bosses and dungeons which also grant you opportunities to get valuable weapons, skills, or items to fight major boses. On my first playthrough alone it took me almost 70 hours to beat and thats not accounting for all the character missions or secret endings you can choose to do. While the lore can be a little hard to grasp, the game offers a amazing and immersive atmosphere that sucks you in and has you craving to play.
I loved this game as a solo playthrough when it first came out. Now my friend and I played coop style through 3 different playthroughs. This game is incredible.
Played for 14 hours fine now a white screen crash on startup. Tried everything and no fix or word from devs.
At first there was pain, the game forces you to hit the wall many times. Then you start to get how things (like parry and dodge) really works and is very rewarding. 
The world is big enough to have finished the game a coupe of times and I know for sure that I'm still missing many quests, items and even complete characters arcs.
Loved it. Can't wait for the DLC.
very big good
good game but hard

it fun
its good
Try finger,

i have played for hundreds of hours on PlayStation and this game is worth playing as an intro to Fromsoft games. it is like a gateway drug to Fromsoftware's other games. Play this if you like a challenge.
;)
Damn near perfect souls game!
Maidens.
good
Unfortunately, this game is a solo-only game. It's not an enjoyable experience if you want to play with friends because of the invader mechanism.
buy this game + dlc

ELDEN RING
Foul Tarnished, In search of the Elden Ring. Emboldened by the flame of ambition. HRAH! Someone must extinguish thy flame. Let it be Margit the Fell.
11/10 one of the best games of our age
This may be the last open-world game that I will play. Side quests are seemingly endless, and expansiveness is insane. If you like point A -> point B games like me (ie: Dark Souls 1,2,3, FF, etc.), this may not be your ideal experience. However if you have persistence and a desire to challenge incredibly difficult foes, you will most certainly enjoy the game. Those who like open world games will find this one less empty than many others, with foes coming out only during set times and roaming around. If you haven't played any dark souls games, this one is a fine place to start.
This is the most artistically inspired game from a large studio I've seen in a while. FromSoft consistently outperforms every AAA studio by a huge margin. Even the most annoying bosses outperform most fights from any other game.
One of the most beautiful and amazing games ever created!
Expansive, Beautiful, Dangerous, Exciting, Anger inducing, You have Died.
try finger, but hole
I am indeed maidenless.
crap
remove commander niall at once
insane enough to 100% the game, was worth every second for melina but the last ending/achievement i had to get was the frenzied flame ending so she ended up wanting to kill me
 best game
This is amazing
is good game
Amazing game overall, from beautiful graphics to polished and fun game mechanics. Haven't played other souls-like games except for Dark Souls 2 so can't really compare it to those but as a souls-like beginner I'd highly recommend it. Only issue I had was open world, but after my first walk-trough I've learnt most of it even tho it's huge. It's just so good that every location just stuck with me. For beginners I'd recommend using wiki to navigate trough the game but I'd highly recommend trying to avoid spoilers on bosses and such, just use the map for "level progression" so you don't enter locations where enemies will shred you cuz of your low level. I'm pretty sure one walk-trough will be enough to memorize most of the game and for new builds you will more then likely know where to go when without any big issues. Also, if you are not satisfied with your build and you find a new more interesting weapon, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO RESPEC. You can respec and redo your build mid game without any repercussions so if you wanna try out new stuff, then do it!
Love this game and can't wait for the new DLC, I've got nothing to complain about! <3
:)
Very good game with rich content and never ending exploration.
Took me two years to beat on and off. Ive never felt as good beating a game.
10/10 Square off best Ash of War

Only complaints are dogs that teleport when your back is to them AND the birds with blades that also chase you around the map indefinitely. Otherwise very fun and a ton of content :)

No ultra-wide support. What?
Incredible art, design & story if you can follow it. also incredibly hard especially if first time playing a souls game like it was for me.
best game in past 10 years, hundreds of hours of gameplay. thousands of playstyles and builds. legit dream rpg game
Hole ahead, in short offer pickle
Wow. That is literally all I had to say when I was greeted with a world such full of passion and love placed into it. Elden Ring is beautiful and has AMAZING environments, voice actors, customization, you name it. This is my first souls game recommended to me by my fiance, so I am very excited to see how the other games hold up to this masterpiece.

Also Fromsoft earned a 10/10 rating from me the moment they said 'hey you like turtles? What if we made a pope turtle?'
10/10 for big hat witch lady and Raya too. Amazing game bros...
Yeah... it's pretty good.

very fun even if its modded or not its fun either way

Most incredible not optimised shit in my life, that can't be fixed any of thousand guides
Since I'm not following a step-by-step walk-through, I have literally no idea where to go, or if my level is appropriate to the location I'm in.
Very hard to tell if a Boss is just insanely hard because I'm not ready for it yet, or if I just suck.
- But then I went back to Limgrave and I suddenly one-shot everything. So at the moment I am over-powered for the starting area, but under-powered for the place I'm at now. It really feels like a drag trying to get runes enough to 'catch up'.

Other than that, it's a great game.
Can't recommend based solely off of things like 

- Requires V-sync on in Nvidia settings just to not have terrible screen tearing
- 60fps locked
- Terrible performance/optimisation
- Terrible hit boxes (From soft fans will disagree, but there are tons of times enemies miss by MILES and you get hit anyway)
- Enemies can still hit you through walls (embarrassing game design)
- Terrible AI, especially for spirit summons
- Terrible physics (we all know Torrent making you die from fall damage after double jumping is pure horse shit, and some times you die from fall damage if you fall off of a ledge that isn't considered solid ground)
- Still has freezing issues for the first 20 minutes of play
- Mid combat (Senua Sacrifice and God of War? Far superior combat and games overall. Note the differences.) 
- Barely any story. Pretty much nonexistent. 

I can write a book on everything wrong with this game. 

It's cool going on an adventure, but god damn is this NOT a AAA game. It's just factually not up to that level of polish and optimisation. Goated art direction, dog shit coding/game design. It's 2024, and a ton of these issues are not only not fixed, but not even ADDRESSED. It's pathetic, tbh. 

Fromsoft fanboyss are some the THE WORST fandoms on the planet. This game is so far from being a masterpiece. Play better games like God of War or Hellblade instead. There are AA games with better gameplay, stories, scores and combat than this. But keep drinking your cult koolaid, sheeple lol. The game could barely meet the requirements for an argument to say it's GOOD. Let alone a masterpiece. Stop being delusional. You're embarrassing yourself.

Ideal game. Have a lot of issues, but despite it - very interesting and challenging
Run when you listen latinas music =>
This game will undoubtedly be on many "greatest games of all time" lists for many years to come.
This is my first time playing a souls type of a game, and it has been a challenging learning curve. I recently started playing it again, and I'm having fun with the game.
Best souls game ever.

Introduced me to a whole new genre of games. Crazy.

Fun on a first playthrough, but subsequent playthroughs feel like a chore unless you're only rushing the main content and skipping all the side dungeons. Significantly degraded multiplayer experience compared to the older games in the Souls series featuring a 6 player limit, covenants and solo invasions.
It's okay.
In the heart of a quaint countryside town, there lived a young boy named Tommy whose world revolved around one obsession: trains. From the rhythmic chug of the locomotives to the distant wail of the whistle, there was nothing Tommy loved more than the sleek metal beasts that raced along the tracks.

However, Tommy harbored a deep-seated fear, one that lurked in the shadows of his otherwise joyful existence ‚Äî spiders. Ever since he was a child, the sight of their hairy legs and beady eyes sent shivers down his spine, filling him with an unshakeable sense of dread.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and darkness descended upon the town, Tommy's parents left him alone in their cozy cottage while they attended to urgent matters in the neighboring village. Despite his unease at being left alone, Tommy found solace in the familiar sound of the distant train whistle echoing through the night.

As he sat by the window, his gaze fixed upon the tracks that snaked through the countryside, Tommy's heart leaped with excitement at the approaching train. But as the familiar rumble grew louder, his joy turned to terror as he spotted something unsettling lurking in the shadows.

A dark figure, with eight spindly legs and glistening eyes, scuttled along the tracks, its presence sending a chill down Tommy's spine. Paralyzed with fear, he watched in horror as the creature drew closer, its movements fluid and sinister in the moonlight.

Desperate to escape the nightmare unfolding before him, Tommy frantically searched for a place to hide. With trembling hands, he barricaded himself in the attic, his heart pounding in his chest as the sounds of the approaching train mingled with the haunting echo of the creature's footsteps.

As the train thundered past, its blaring whistle drowning out the cacophony of Tommy's racing thoughts, he dared to peek through the dusty windowpane, hoping against hope that the nightmare had passed.

But to his horror, the creature remained, its malevolent gaze fixed upon him with a hunger that sent shivers down his spine. With each passing moment, it drew closer, its shadowy form growing larger and more menacing with every step.

Just as all hope seemed lost, a blinding light pierced the darkness, illuminating the attic with a brilliance that banished the creature back into the night. And there, standing in the doorway, was Tommy's father, his worried expression softened by relief as he gathered his trembling son in his arms.

In the safety of his father's embrace, Tommy's fear slowly began to fade, replaced by a sense of gratitude for the love and protection that surrounded him. And though the memory of that fateful night would linger in his nightmares for years to come, Tommy found solace in the knowledge that no matter how terrifying the darkness may seem, the light of love would always guide him home.
It's a great game to play with a friend, that forces the play to be a of a set skill level individually to progress past certain points which I respect. The fights are fun, quests have depth, magic expansive, weapons various.... It's a bomb game. Watch out for invaders if just starting. Games better with a friend and overall a delight. Sometimes crash collision is plain wrong on a puzzle or a boss has a move trigger after already being killed so you die. Overall entirely worth it despite any minor/rare peculiarities and it's beautiful AF too. Great co-op I love to play with my partner.

Worst Berserk adaptation
D.L.C when?
magic go shwshhh dragons go ahhhhh big guys on little horses holding up the stars, Berserk tributes via armor/weapons/in game locations. getting sidetracked while on your 3rd sidetrack from what you were planning to do. I mean what isn't in this fucking game tbh. This game is the reason I can't play other RPG's really
HORRID GAME VERY HARD!!! DEFINITELY DO RECCOMEND!!!
POG
GOD
Give me 2 giant swords, faith, strength, a can of beer, and Melina by my side, and I'll beat this game with my eyes closed.
Boring 60fps locked weeb garbage for those who let other ppl to fuck their wife
The further we reach the end of ages, the more trash games release.

This game, 9/10 almost 10/10 juicer. One playthru can take up to 120 hours, which is enjoyable and worth 60$+ havent played a good game in a while, here it is. A lot to discover, many things to collect, many achievements, many bosses, many hidden areas and much more. 

Note: I may be addicted
Pretty fun ig
nice
good as
good game cant wait for dlc
The best open world game ive ever played.
Goated
O you don't have the right, o you don't have the right, by the way you don't have the right, o you don't have the right.
Good Game
Best game ever made... no more words needed
She Elden on my Ring till I Erdtree
Best game!
I pray Fromsoft keeps the ball rolling.
The infinte character builds and the true openworld - the lore that engages you and a game that rewards skill or intelligence! Get gud players!
Hey that's pretty good!
i lost my will to play...
Amazing game and now the Shadow of the Erdtree will be released and I look forward for it.
Maybe the best game i've ever played
Very cool very nice
240p gamings
Boring gameplay
The best game I played in the last years. A big open world to explore and tought but fun bosses to fight. Really one of the best experiences ive had!
Unlike previous soul-like games (such as Sekiro, Darksouls, or Bloodborne), Elden Ring is the first within the series to have an explorable open world.

 I'm a big fan of souls-like games, and not only does the game match the standards of its predecessors, but IMHO surpasses them. On top of this, after having completed every side-quest and main boss fight within the game, I felt very in touch and immersed in the lore of this beautifully crafted universe. 

The combat is challenging and feels very rewarding upon completion. I'd highly recommend playing this game.
it's alright I guess
need to install mods to play with 144fps and 3440x1440 resolution without black bars, and play in offline mode only :)


Malenia is the BEST GIRL EVER AND EVER

THIS IS THE RUN!!!! "YOU DIED"

Dudes will see this and go "hell yeah"
This game is amazing get it and learn how to play it if you‚Äôve never played a fromsoft game it‚Äôs so good and can actually be very easy contrary to other reviews and things you might have heard
Ahh, may chaos take the world! 
May chaos take the world!
a little tricky, i'm sure it's fine
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
funny sword women bully me
I am malenia ,blade of miquella

my favorite part was when he said "its elden ringin time" the coldest video game line
played 53 hours worth of elden ring in past 5 days. I think that should say enough maybe? Idk but I've never in my life watched so many youtube tutorials in my life. Thank you Elden Ring for this semi masterpiece of a game you made <3
this game is insanely good, in my opinion better than the souls trilogy, truly something amazing and different <3
morgot stomped me with da grubbers
buy it
is good
liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
First time I played, it was horrible. Second time I played, I used an external map tool on the side to track the questlines and items to get and it was such a glorious experience. This ends up being one of the most fun game I've played in a very long time. I wish I had MORE to play !

I just want to add that if you pushed through the difficulty, at some point you really get better at accepting death and eventually getting better at surviving. It's a fun game to force your personal growth to the next level.
Hard + Fun = Good Time
Radahn My Beloved
good
Verrrr good. Feels like a huge love letter to old fans and a great introduction for new fans. Got pretty mad a few times along the way, but I can't help but appreciate the amount of heart put into this product.

No Bed of Chaos though.
One of the best games FromSoftware has ever made. With similar open world elements of the legend of Zelda breath of the wild. The boss fights and some of the tougher enemies seem daunting at first but the open world helps by just letting you go somewhere else and level grind, craft items, and find items to help you go back and defeat the enemy you had a problem with.  It is also very easy and convenient that you can summon different creatures to help you in tough spots and summon friends or randoms pretty much wherever you want. The map on this game is massive, finally giving us a mount to ride on while exploring, with many detailed places to discover. The combat is rewarding and fresh. Very much looking forward to the DLC. 10/10 game.
One of the Best games ever, love it with the first person view mod as well.. great combat puts Skyrim to shame..
Some may say that this game is a little silly because it gratuitously reuses bosses and is too hard or too big etc. But I say that it is cool and awesome. Still not as good as Dark Souls 1.
However, the Sewer Mogh (TM) is my main gripe with it. Mohg (along with most of the "story" bosses I guess) shouldn't have been reused. 'Cause he's my favorite.
WOW
fort,
night!
decent (one of my favourite games)
Ignore the guides, game plays best from vanilla to get after it. Delightful game, 10/10 for the year.
e;lden ring
very good game
still souls still fun
FOUL TARNISHED, IN SEARCH OF THE ELDEN RING, EMBOLDENED BY THE FLAME OF AMBITION. SOMEONE MUST EXTINGUISH THY FLAME...
Apesar de n√£o ser meu jogo favorito da from software, √© definitivamente o melhor souls like deles dispon√≠vel no pc. Recomendo caso seja o seu primeiro jogo do g√™nero ou caso voc√™ j√° tenha jogados outros souls-like. Variedade colossal de armas, builds, feiti√ßos, magias, itens e maneiras de jogar. Desde cosplay do guts at√© atirar laser pelo olho igual o ciclope dos xmen.

Elden ring apesar de escorregar em alguns detalhes pelo jogo, √© um jogo completamente fora da curva e o Miyazaki √© um g√™nio fazendo jogo. Recomendo demais. Vale full price.
One of the greatest open world games ever, hands down.
Honestly after playing this game, Introducing me to the Souls genre, and me going back to play every STEAM RELEASE Souls. I have to say man is this game just Dark Souls 2, 2 in every good way. Everything about this game has fully shifted how I enjoy games and I'm proud to have played it. 3/10 not Demons
Good gam
she elden on my ring till IS THAT A FUCKING DRAGON
i suck, but it's still fun
W
kinda cool
Best Fromsoft/Souls game to date. So much to explore and do. So many build varieties. Replay-ability is beyond belief. You can make it as difficult or easy as you want using a new personal summon system. What are you waiting for, it's amazing!
pretty good
[h2] A great game suffering from various issues. [/h2]

- Many of Elden Ring's locations aren't worth exploring if the current build you're running doesn't require the items/equipment you'd find at those locations.
- Late game enemies/bosses do an absurd amount of damage.
- (If you're planning on doing co-op) Near constant Invasions by other players get tiresome after so many hours of just trying to play with your friends. (You only really get invaded while engaging in co-op)
- It feels like you're a normal human fighting [b] FINAL EPISODE LEVEL [/b] anime antagonists as you watch them perform amazing feats meanwhile you're just trying to land a jab or two in between their bouts of wild flailing.

At some point it may stop being fun and you may continue playing out of pure spite.
Other than that, [i] it's just Dark Souls 4. [/i]

best game ever made
Good game mid story. Second half felt anoying with delayed attacks being spammed and final boss (spoilers) is a fish that spam teleports half the battle while being fast and a tank. realy anoying when you have to fight 2 bosses back to back no healing and the boss has homing missles and speed on its side while being a wall. otherwise realy realy good and a great job by fromsoftware at making the first big open world souls like and another classic.

cured my depression
This is the best game From Software has put out... EVER
Never played this type of game before. Real love/hate relationship but Elden Ring is so pretty that I cant stay away. If you find it hard then use the forums and get advice. I have been stuck at seemingly impossible bosses many times. A bit of advice online tips the balance and all of sudden the Boss is beaten. Sometimes takes several hours to complete another storyline to get the thing you need to complete another storyline to get the sword or spell you need. Its so enjoyable doing these extra bits that you can forget why you started out on them. This game is massive. And so beautiful.
beautiful views and overall fun
Best Openworld game I ever played Dungeon,Dragon and so many magic spells and incantation and sword skills
Just Wow I really luv this type of game if you are Noob you can also play as a mage or faiths Game map is really big you need so much time to explore

So much copy and paste, this is worse than all the copy and paste in Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. FromSoftware clearly absolutely hates doing work, this is a $19.99 rehash of DarkSouls-3 in a bigger map that gaslights into believing it doesn't copy and paste the same shack model 5 times before you get out of the starting zone.

I'm likely seeing it even worse since I just came off a binge through Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 - but the only original content is the boss fights. Every single animation is from one of the older games, every single weapon art is just a remap of an enemy attack to the player. Bosses like Leonine Misbegotten are also mostly just Bloodborne animations reused.

Up to Liurnia I've seen only 2 different shack models and have counted 16 unique ruin wall pieces and only 2 different kinds of towers. Every Tunnels dungeon map uses the same handful of pieces and all have the same boss-room. Only one of the caves uses a different boss room, but that's because it's a thru cave to the dragon covenant isle.

Sure, the gameplay is mostly fine but it's impossible to overlook how puffed and inflated the content is. Liurnia doesn't need to be even a quarter the size it is, it's literally just flat puff. 

The game relies too much on some sudden burst damage coming out of combos so you're doing a pittance of damage and then all of sudden BAM! 1/3rd the enemy's HP goes away and it dies. That makes it difficult to judge if you should even be engaging an enemy or not as you cannot tell how hard you actually hit until the burst occurs (praise optimal level maps on wikis). Usual souls' game issues that disengagement is an RNG chance affair, so don't get roped into melee if you don't want to start a damage cheese race as you can roll some dice on whether you can get disengage or just get killed for trying. Attack tracking and variable length holding has been reasonable, I haven't actually noticed any enemies doing DS3 nonsense of holding their chambered swings for varying lengths of time.

TL;DR: only buy this on sale, it's not worth $59.99 usd, not even close.

Do not feel bad about murdering innocent birds. You will come to the conclusion that birds must be erased from the world.
another masterpiece
Yes
Pros:
Good character customization

Cons:
Everything else

AoE attacks are lame as fuck, flying opponents in a game 70% centered around melee combat are lame as fuck

some bosses are geniunely fun to play against, because it comes down to your ability to dodge their attacks, other bosses are lame as fuck, because it is that much harder or borderline impossible to dodge an attack.

"b-b-b-b-b-b-b-but why dont you just g-g-g-g-g-g-get better?"

because there are other games to play that dont slap your dick for no reason
Best game of all time!
It's not hard, just roll :P
Great

pretty good
At least Japan still makes great games!

meow
Yeah, it's great.
But damn, it's impressive that it runs so well, on high details, on my laptop's silent mode.
Ultra solid work done by devs.
very good

The fact that I have played this game (and finished) on 
PS4 
PS5 
Xbox series X 
And PC 
Says something
its ok
This was once the best game that angered me to no bounds. Now that "honour" is placed on another title, at this point, this is just one of the best games I have ever played. There are some really annoying things in it, but despite that (or because of it), this game is awesome. Right now, I think that this game is the golden standard for an action - adventure RPG title, against which all the rest must be measured. The game has everything: different ways to express yourself, multiplayer (coop and versus), epic bossfights, great aestetic, great setting, great story - all the makings of a great game. If you cannot complete it by yourself, try it with friends, or try to summon random helpers for the bosses.
Don't be Maidenless
gud game
first woman i ever talked to gave me a horse 10/10
very cool
Kill me
GOTY FOR A REASON
Really nice game, recommend to try out.

Warning if you have issues playing this game its definitely a Skill issue
Arise ye Tarnished
Its aight
Yes.
cool but it kinda hard for me

prob the worst souls like game i have ever played in my entire life dont waste ur money on this and buy dark souls 3 instead
Pvp fun af
what can i say... from software makes really good games.
delivers an unforgettable gaming experience, seamlessly blending intense combat, intricate world-building, and challenging gameplay. Set in a vast open-world crafted by Hidetaka Miyazaki, it captivates with stunning visuals, deep customization, and a gripping narrative.
It took me a very, [i]very[/i] long time to understand this game. I really thought it wasn't for me.

Came back to it this year. Finally "got it". This is peak fantasy.
BEST TORTURE GAME EVER PERIOD!!
it alright
you have to be there to experience it, the beauty and the challange
Love the run to your runes simulator so much fun!!! but fr I respect the game for being very difficult and making me rage quit 5-7 times already. Not sure if I would recommend this game to someone that wants to have chill experience because it certainly won't. But if you want a really hard game then play this game.
Liked everything
Alot of content
Fantastic game.
One of the best games ever.
Mixes elements of souls-like and open world perfectly
I never thought a fromsoft game could make me so bored.
kinda mid tbh
BBOOOOAAHHHHHH
[h2]An Unremarkably Detailed Examination of Elden Ring on PC[/h2]

Elden Ring, a title that has found a home on the PC platform, introduces itself with a sense of ambition that is, frankly, just there. Amidst a sea of games clamoring for attention, it exists, steadfastly occupying its own space, I suppose. This review endeavors to dissect the game in a manner as colorlessly precise as possible, without swaying too far towards any form of excitement or disapproval.

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics[/h2]

The core gameplay of Elden Ring, as one might expect, involves a series of actions, quests, and battles. There is a certain level of complexity to the combat system, offering a variety of weapons and spells for players to use. Movement through the game world is facilitated by walking, running, and the use of a mount. These elements function in a way that allows you to interact with the game, which is about as much as one can say on the matter. The mechanics are there, they work, and I suppose that's an important aspect of being a game.

[h2]Visual and Auditory Experience[/h2]

Visually, Elden Ring presents a vast world filled with diverse landscapes, characters, and creatures. The graphics do their job, rendering the game's environment in a manner that can be seen with the eyes. The sound design accompanies these visuals, providing auditory cues and a soundtrack that exists alongside the visual components. It's all very much a part of the game, and to be frank, it doesn't evoke much beyond that basic acknowledgment.

[h2]Narrative and World Building[/h2]

The narrative of Elden Ring, along with its world-building, is present. There's a story being told within a universe that has been crafted with a certain level of detail. Characters and lore fill the game, offering information and context for those inclined to explore it. Whether these elements are compelling or merely exist as part of the game's structure is a matter of perspective, I guess. They're there if you want to delve into them, but I'm not sure how much they'll impact your overall experience.

[h2]Overall Impression[/h2]

To encapsulate the experience of playing Elden Ring on PC in a few words, one might describe it as 'playing a game.' It's an experience that, while functional and comprehensive in its scope, maintains a steadfast commitment to neutrality in its execution. The game does what it sets out to do, offering a gameplay experience that exists and continues to exist as long as you choose to engage with it. In conclusion, Elden Ring is a game available for play on the PC, offering a mixture of combat, exploration, and story that collectively forms a cohesive gaming experience. It is a title that will occupy time and, perhaps, space on your hard drive. To those considering whether to embark on this journey, it may be wise to abstain, safeguarding oneself from the risk of encountering an overwhelmingly average experience that could potentially unsettle one's commitment to polar rating systems.
As someone completely new to the Souls-like genre, delving into Elden Ring was an experience beyond expectations. Without any prior exposure to similar games or even a glance at gameplay trailers, I was immediately captivated by its world design and combat system. Every facet of the game seemed meticulously crafted, drawing me in with its immersive environments and challenging yet rewarding gameplay. Elden Ring surpassed any preconceptions I had, delivering an experience that felt nothing short of perfect.
One of the best if not the best games ever!
At this rate I'll finish the game in 2040, still great tho just getting stuck a lot. *(skill issue on my side)*
[h1]PROS[/h1]
This game is amazing! If you like games like Bloodborne, Sekiro, Dark Souls, then you are going to love this one. Keep in mind that it can be difficult. The map is HUGE, huge variety of things to loot and craft, a ton of unique weapons, and a HUGE variety of dark twisted mind blowing enemies to slay. I also like writing and reading messages that other players left, seeing players in the world every once in awhile, and seeing bloodstains where other players have previously died which warns me of the dangers. I always thought these were unique mechanics.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
My only complaint is the way Co-op is handled. Co-Op is the same as in Bloodborne. You would think this would be fixed after all of the complaints after Bloodborne. The issue with this, is that it is sometime hard to call people in to help you with a boss. Sometimes you will be sitting there waiting ten minutes for a gold mark to pop up on the floor. When it finally does, you sometimes get invaded by a player. Sometimes that player is a OP try hard and they completely destroy you and the person you summoned and the session ends. Now you have to go and wait for the gold mark again, when all you wanted was help with the boss. There should be an option that allows you to turn off invasions altogether instead of forcing players to play PVP every time you ask other players for help. To make matters worse, you have to craft something called a "Furlcalling Finger Remedy" in order to play with friends or get help from other players. So if you die, you not only have to wait for another gold seal to pop up, but you have to craft these every single time. They are easy to craft but it is still a headache. Especially when you want to play with your friends and it kicks them every time you die and forces you to go through this entire process again. The Co-Op is just a little bit of a nuisance and needs work. 


[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
These cons don't break the game in anyway! Its still an amazing game overall. I would still give it 10/10 even with these flaws! I would definitely buy it again for full price. Don't think about it, just buy it. It's well worth the $60 price tag. You won't be disappointed. I have 129 hours into this game and I am not near close to being done. I am blown away by how long it is. (That's what she said)

"open world dark souls" for me is more tedious than fun.  Rmb how you searched every nook and cranny in Dark souls? now try an entire map. By the end I just wanted to finished the game and stop playing. 

Npc quests are still extremely obscure and inconsequential. 

Repeat enemies make new areas feel uninspired. 

Bosses seems to be designed with the use of summons in mind.  Extremely wide move set with long combos that make it hard to read moves and small attack windows. Bosses hit really hard. 

Personally, even after completing the game, I do not feel like I am very good at PvE. Certain enemies will still rape my ass easily. Making the idea of 'getting gud' not very rewarding. 

I personally hope Fromsoft just makes a new IP with Sekiro's combat. Enough dark souls man D: 

Radahn imo hottest person in the game... esp with that horse!!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Here is a list of the best games that I have ever played.

1. Bloodborne (PC port when?)
2. Hollow Knight
3. Elden Ring (over 300 of my hours are on PS5)
4. The Legend of Zelda: TotK & BotW
5. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
6. Stardew Valley

that's it. that's all I have to say.
[h1] Elden Ring is the best Fromsoft game I have ever played, but the flaws that it has are really highlighted because of how good it is.[/h1]

Elden Ring as an open-world RPG game is overwhelmingly good. The location and enemy variety kept me excited, looking forward to what the next area will look like and what type of fucked-up enemy Miyazaki has concocted. There are major secret areas and mini dungeons that can be found just by exploring in the open world, and once you get hooked on finding them, six hours will have passed and the deadline for your schoolwork will have already passed too. I spent 20 hours just exploring the whole of Limgrave (the starting area) because I found a dungeon somewhere. This game will really make you say, "What the hell is that?" throughout your journey, then get you distracted by seven different things on the way, and I freaking love it that the world holds secrets and really feels alive and breathing.

The highlight of this game for me, though, as an action RPG and Souls fan, is the combat and bosses, and I'm really happy with the quality of the Remembrance bosses. All of them have really interesting design, voice acting, music, lore, and movesets, that I really wish for Elden Ring to have a system where you can fight bosses again, similar to the Reflection of Strength from Sekiro. All of the Remembrance bosses feel and fight like final bosses in other games but in a cinematic way especially the last few gauntlet of bosses in the endgame. Of course, they're not perfect, and some have attacks that really feel unfair [spoiler](most notably Maliketh's Edgelord attacks and Elden Beast's Elden Stars and the ring around the rosey attacks), [/spoiler] but overall, the bosses fight fair and square. I also really like that some boss attacks can only be dodged by jumping, which adds a layer of fun to a fight. Couple that layer of fun with the number of weapons, ash of war, incantations, and spells that you can use, and you can see how much depth the combat mechanic of Elden Ring has.

The NPC quest this time around, though, has really improved in flexibility and quality. Unlike in previous Souls games, where you talk to some NPC and progress their questline to a certain extent, then forget about them for some time only to find them in a ditch somewhere because you didn't do a certain thing or progressed through the game too much, all of that is somewhat fixed. NPCs in Elden Ring stay still in the last spot you saw them unless you progress through the game, which causes some part of their questline to be skipped, or if you progress their questline by exhausting their dialogue or giving them a specific item. You can even do some quests after you've beaten the game, unless, of course, that specific NPC questline is tied to a boss or some other things that became inaccessible after some time. I really recommend a spoiler-free guide if you want to experience these questlines on your own.

Let's now move on to the flaws that I have mentioned in the title. After a certain point in the game, you can feel that enemy variety and level design have been thrown out the window (if you played the game, then you would know the part I'm describing). Enemies that have no reason to be there are there, and the amount of damage they deal is on par with some of the early-game optional bosses. I didn't really mind the repetitive and reskin-optional bosses because, "Eh, whatever that still makes sense," but if you start placing enemies at a location where it doesn't really make sense to be, then that's just lazy. This dip in quality is clearly noticeable, and I just slugged through that specific section as fast as I could, but I'm really glad that the quality picked up again right at the end of the game because that would have left a scar in an otherwise really great game.

Overall, Elden Ring really exceeded my expectations of what an open-world game could be, and it really deserves the Game of the Year title it has. Let yourself be cast into an unknown world and explore it, finding every secret or taking your own pace. No matter what suits you, you will have a great time. You will experience Insomia for weeks, but in exchange, you will experience one of the best games of all time. I'm really excited to play the DLC once it comes out, and also, [b]where is the Bloodborne PC port [/b]?

amazing game
best game ever made
Great
this is a very fun game 5 out of 5
Best game I've ever played

Amazing game recommend if you like soul-like games
great game, could be a bit harder
Great game especially if your a glutton. for punishment! Definitely recommended if you love a challenge! Plays great on Rog Ally with lossless scaling app.

It's very fun, but i would definitely recommend doing different starting characters every so often because it will get boring after a while of using the same class
If you  have ever enjoyed at Soulslike your love it.
It good. Don't have to git as good as other Dark Souls so it's more accessible.

Level Vitality people.
Seek death, tarnished.
Both the best and easiest mainline Dark Souls game. 9.8/10. Muh boat guy.
This is a game. And you should play it
Love this game
I was waiting for ds4, but i got a casual, underdog game with an empty open world and copy paste bosses, but it was quite playable. Malenia is forever in my heart.

Ahhh may chaos take the world...
Goon!
It's not perfect. Framerate somtimes leaves a lot to be desired. Not super optimized for average hardware, but design-wise, it's one of the best games of all time, and it WILL consume your life if you let it.
i have played this game 4 hour have gotten married found true love traveled the world gotten murdered by  bird with swords attached to it;s feet and 2 controllers have quit 2 cm from yeeting my monitor outta the window man the game is pretty the sounds are amazing and there is a golden knight on a horse spawncamping
GOOD GAME

Extremely fun and expansive, the perfect balance of exploration and combat with new content even after 100s of hours
Dark Souls but Open world! if you like Souls-likes this game is must and has everything you can expect from a From Software game. Good & Bad.
Enemy ahead
I've been getting whooped so bad that it gave me flash backs of my childhood.
Beautiful ahh game

Best Game Ever
keep dying, keep winning. good gam
this game is the real deal

Literally best game ever made of all time, need I say more? gameplay 10/10 exploration 10/10 lore 10/10 quests 10/10 bosses 10/10 combat 10/10 graphics 10/10 ease of access & compatability 10/10 
The only singular issue this game has is it still has the terrible netcode issues that have plagued all of Fromsoftwares titles, but this is easy to overlook especially if you are not too interested in the PVP
beautiful scenery, awesome game play, and deep lore. this is one of the best games i've played in my life.
8/10, this is the only single-player I've ever put more than 100 hours in. all the lore is amazing, the world is beautiful, and *most* of the bosses are fun and don't make me wanna shoot myself :D

lots of cool magics and weapons; the combat makes you feel cool as heck, and exploration is fun and rewarding. even after 300 *total* hours, I'm still finding new secrets.

currently my favorite game, would recommend to literally anyone. love this game to death.
It is simply the finest game ever made...
"YOU DIED"
10/10 game, beautiful visuals, epic combat, near impossible bosses (when you are a scrub like me) but beating a fromsoft boss is honestly the most rewarding feeling ever.
Great game
Is this a Berserk reference?
This game is the definition of PEAK
KYS
Great Game. Cant wait until the DLC in June
mind blowing game
Having played through this game multiple times, with 356 hours played at the time of this review, I can not suggest others to buy it at all.

This game has made a lot of advancements for the "open-world" (more on why open-world is in quotes later) genre, but I just absolutely despise the gameplay.
The best way I can describe the gameplay is that it's the same shit as always. Spell spam (when a boss/enemy spams spells over and over instead of actually doing anything unique or fun), AoE spam (Same thing as spell spam but instead of spamming spells they're spamming attacks that deal damage in an Area of Effect), combo spam (Same thing as above but instead of whatever it's high damage fast attacking combos), or spamming roll catchers (moves that have delayed attacks designed to trick you into rolling early). Sometimes, you may even get a "new" thing where they combine the things I mentioned into one singular enemy!
Oh, there's also damage over difficulty (which imo is the worst offender here), which basically just when they decide to make something deal a ludicrous amount of damage instead of actually making it a difficult fight, which leads me into why I don't consider this game to be "open-world". The damage/health scaling for this game is... abysmal? Yeah, abysmal. Nearly every area you enter until over half way through the game you just feel so weak. Either because you don't have enough health to survive the attacks, or you don't have enough damage to not take an eternity just to kill the one enemy/boss so you CAN level up and try to get more HP/damage, leading to the game not really being "open-world" but a linear game with a strong suggestion on where to go. Like, I don't want to spend hours farming, I want to spend hours PLAYING. Farming runes is not playing, it's just mindlessly repeating the same exact movements over and over and over and over and over and over again just so that you CAN actually play the game! IT'S NOT FUN!

Truly and honestly, I think this game has some of the best features of all the soulsborne games, but the combat is just so horrible to me that I grit my teeth and wonder "why am I even playing this?" every single time I launch it, because it's just amplified every problem I had with the old soulsborne games in an attempt to make things more "DiFfIcUlT", leading to the game just feeling annoying to me rather than challenging. I sunk nearly a thousand hours into DS3 because whenever I died I felt like there was something to learn on my end to do better. Passed my first playthrough of this game, it's rarely ever felt like my fault for dying, it just feels like the game's trying to be as annoying as possible. From the combo spam, combo's which have roll catchers for every attack in the combo, the endless FP they gave NPC's because... well just because, the auto parry they gave some NPC's because... well because, to the endless stamina they gave NPC's, well... you get my point, making every fight with them a game of waiting for an opportunity to attack (which is also the problem with many of the bosses in this game as well, but I'll get onto that in a bit). I play games to have fun. Expecting me to be perfect isn't fun, it's exhausting and annoying.

My biggest gripe with the bosses is that they just don't make sense. Why give a boss an extremely high damage combo that homes onto you? Because it's "DiFfIcUlT". Why let a boss like the big red fox just keep jumping every half second while spamming spells non stop that home onto you? "DiFfIcUlTy". Why make a boss fight like Maliketh who just jumps away from you, spams combos that drain HP on hit as well as limit HP on hit (You know, that system of limiting HP like they did in DS2? That thing everyone loved :| )? "DiFfIcUlTy". Why throw the same bosses in stupid places over and over and over and over again? "DiFfIcUlTy". Like, the dual godskin duo bossfight is literally just the same "bosses" (let's be real with ourselves, these aren't bosses when you fight them as much as this, they're just large enemies, like the dogs in Caelid), except here's the kicker, THERE'S MORE HP THAN THE TWO OF THEM COMBINED! Meaning you have to kill them, have them respawn, so you cna kill them AGAIN! SO MUCH FUCKING FUN! HAHAHAHA! Piss off.

By pushing themselves to the point they have, they have begun to show the cracks in the armor of Soulsborne, showing us the problems they've had from the start, the only difference is that they're in full view now. Enjoy looking up meta guides, because that's about the only way you'll have fun playing it.
good
its gud
very cool
good gameplay...good story..nice snowballing ..just waiting for the dlc

Nintendo has done it again. In this sequel to Breath of the Wild set in Hyrule just a few years after its predecessor, Link and Zelda find themselves pulled through space and time into a brand new adventure! With never-before-seen powers like Ultrahand for building wacky and useful contraptions, Ascend for swimming through the world geometry, and Rewind for fixing pesky little mistakes, you're sure to have the time of your life for only seventy dollars (and no it is not going on sale ever).
ez game
its good if you enjoy destroying your furniture
Cool game
This game punishes me for my insolence, and I'm here for it!
i love fromsoftware
I've played videogames since the 1980s..
and this, is without a doubt, the best game I've ever played

Loved the whole journey from beginning to the end

Can't wait to dive into the Shadows of the Erdtree expansion


There is nothing quite like hearing "I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella" 50 times a day
Pain will give rise to momentary peace
Great game for playing alone. If you use seemless muliplayer mod, multiplayer is better

"Elden Ring," the latest masterpiece from FromSoftware, delivers an unforgettable gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of open-world exploration and immersive storytelling.

Whether you're traversing lush forests, scaling towering mountains, or delving into dark dungeons, every corner of the Lands Between feels meticulously crafted and ripe for exploration. The sense of discovery is unparalleled, as players stumble upon ancient ruins, enigmatic NPCs, and cryptic lore that deepen the mystery of the world.

Combat in "Elden Ring" is a thrilling dance of strategy and skill, offering a variety of weapons, spells, and abilities for players to master. From visceral melee combat to exhilarating mounted battles, each encounter feels dynamic and satisfying. The game's challenging difficulty encourages players to adapt and learn from their mistakes, rewarding perseverance with a sense of accomplishment unlike any other. Boss fights, in particular, are epic spectacles that push players to their limits, testing their reflexes and tactics in intense showdowns against larger-than-life foes.

Beyond its gameplay mechanics, "Elden Ring" excels in its storytelling and atmosphere. The game's narrative unfolds organically through cryptic dialogue, environmental storytelling, and haunting imagery. Every NPC, no matter how minor, has a story to tell, adding layers of depth and intrigue to the world. Meanwhile, the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack sets the mood perfectly, evoking a sense of wonder, danger, and melancholy as you journey through the Lands Between.

In conclusion, "Elden Ring" stands as a triumph of game design, seamlessly blending innovative gameplay, captivating world-building, and immersive storytelling into a truly unforgettable experience. FromSoftware has once again raised the bar for open-world RPGs, delivering a game that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on players for years to come. Whether you're a seasoned Soulsborne veteran or a newcomer to the genre, "Elden Ring" is an absolute must-play that showcases the best of what video games have to offer.



I ANIT READIN ALAT

Summary:
i used chat GPT but this games pretty good 11/10 would elden ring again
It's hard but fun!
so fum, i like the swords and the lazers
This is one of the best there is when it comes to an incredible game. Exploration, build variety, combat, skills, items, lore and enemy designs are at its peak in this fromsoft game and it makes me sad. Sad because this feel like their final hurrah for the "souls" series and its definitely their magnum opus. 
If you approach this game and expect to just do it old school style aka stab the boss in the behind and just roll, you are gonna have a bad time. Utilize everything at your disposal and trust me, fromsoft gives you so much tools to play with in the form of summons and usable items. I only have minor grievances where a dungeon boss should have remained unique to a certain questline [strike] and malenia being to hard 
[/strike] and small performance issues. Enjoy the game, explore everything and don't limit yourself to the old dark-souls gameplay. 10/10 Masterpiece
You'll struggle, you'll cry, but when you finally reach the other side it feels wonderful
I completed the achievements list and obtained about 90% of all collectable items, i've done all optional content, quests, bosses, caves, Crypts. I loved this game, I will be playing the DLC. Having done all that I Would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a challenge in a game. it's Amazing, a 10/10.
Fun game just pretty difficult
Literally dark souls but longer and new content and features. Who doesn't want that?
I had bought this game before and ended up returning it because I didn't think i'd be able to progress in it. I had never tried a Souls game before and told myself it was too hard. I play games for fun not to beat my head against a wall. I finally told myself i'd try again. I'd really give it my all. Today I beat the game, downing every boss including Melenia. Elden Ring is one of the best games i've ever played and i'm glad I decided to give it another go. What a journey. Thanks FromSoftware! <3
This is pretty much the best game ever made.
Yes.
A challenge meant to be taken slowly and enjoyed. My first playthrough was blind, but to achieve each ending i looked up guides, but it didnt detract from the fun i had in anyway. truly an amazing game. 340 hours later, i got all the achievements and im not opposed to another playthrough haha
Good game.
fingers but hole
fire giant worst boss in the game
W asf
Rise up and conquer the world
One of the best games ever made!!
good game

I touch woman and get a debuff, very realistic 10/10
great game could be better if i was allowed to marry malenia
This game is the God sent game of a lifetime! Now with a COOP MOD that is very well optimised with achievements! Playing solo is something i highly recommend on your first play-though but Holy Erdtree is this fun with friends and the DLC right around the corner, oh man im BRICKED UP! Now time to go slave/simp for Melina and Ranni.
hard game but fun game
great head ahead.
Ez
I like to suffer. Try finger but hole. No horse ahead. Great game!!
yea

Very impeccable.
ranni beloved
game, too hard, me not good enough
Captivating
Good.
try finger, but hole
This game was truly a amazing experience that I will never forget, the game in all aspects was amazing and good, but I will say one thing, this is not  a fun game, is a very FRUSTRATING game, even more if it is your first souls like game, which in my occasion it was, I believe that are many other games out there that mimic elden ring but are not frustrating as elden ring, so if  you wanna have fun and not be frustrated most of the time dont play this game and play another, but putting aside all that, this game was phenomenal, the desing, music, map, bosses, weapons, armors and lore and much more it was all amazing, and overcoming each frustration I had with this game was amazing and it taught me many things, I recommend very much.
MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!
meow
fking amazing
its amazing? 9th playthrough and still tough fights and endless build potential

A good story created by Miyazaki Hidetaka and George R. R. Martin.

Amazing game, highly recommend following an NPC guide otherwise you'll miss out on a LOT of content.
Was fun
Tibia mariner is a peak boss.

There's always something to do.
Danger around every corner.
AMAZING combat.
Just hit 120 hours on ER
patience :)
its EPIC
Kinda boring tbh and I love not getting hit but I still take dmg
Its ok
Gotta leave a review for this heat.

This game is so massive I get a weird sad emotional reaction trying to decide what to do next. The map is enormous, there are so many character builds I can experiment with, endless enemies, weapons, items, spells... ugh.

I'll be standing in the middle of nowhere looking at my surroundings in awe of the endless places I can go that I haven't discovered yet. Everytime I look at my map to see all of the sites of grace (checkpoints) i've rested at, thinking theres no possible way i've left an area undiscovered, I find another and another and another and another. Everytime I think i've cleared an area of any bosses, I find another boss.

These are the kinds of video games I live for. I am nowhere NEAR done with Elden Ring. I see myself playing this over and over and over and over again, and I don't expect to keep finding new things with every playthrough. I'm stoked.
Hold on! This game has a plot? And quests? I thought it was just a death simulator
gaming god.
no ultrawide support fromsoft wtf only game i own that wont and i have 200+ games and locked at 60 its ancient game design
very gooood 

edit: 
so this still stands i have an addiction now
it cant get better than this
Waiting for the great sale so I can finally face the Tree Sentinel again.
Mimic tear is the anti thug shaker of elden ring.
BEST
As someone new to souls-like games, i already want to kill myself.
definitely not the worst game ive played
Years ago, I declared gaming dead, buried my controller, and went on to lead a productive, boring adult life. But then, Elden Ring descended upon me like a curse from the gaming gods, resurrecting my inner gamer with a vengeance. Now, I'm hopelessly addicted, forsaking sunlight, social life, and responsibilities as if they're the final bosses I can't defeat. My once-structured existence is now a chaotic quest in the Lands Between, and I'm the tarnished hero who forgot to level up 'life management.' Send help... or more Estus Flasks.
Fun as fuck but im also shite thnx for adding co op so my buddy can carry me!
What can I even say? It's a masterpiece.
Dark Souls on Drugs: Gigachad Edition.
i hate this game so much, i play it everyday. sadly no micolash or bed of chaos

Fingerfolk Hero's Grave
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!
nc nc
This may be the best game of all time.
not that great compare to the older games.
the greatest game of all time nothing else to say.
The game is truly amazing. A mind bogglingly large open world, which actually has delicately handcrafted content everywhere unlike doing the same thing over and over again (lookin at you assassin's creed), its enemies and bosses are all amazing, its customization is near endless, and it's overall just an amazing experience. It is tougher than most other games, but once you get into the game's flow after some time playing, it's immensely rewarding and enjoyable to go through.
Unreal game, highly recommend, easily one of my top 10 of all time!
Yes.
Masterpiece! Buy it, you dont need to try it! :)
This game has taken my life from me
every time i hear anything about lord or god all i can think about is the pain and suffering this game has brought me.

10/10
ELDEN RING GOES HARD.

This game has made me scream, cry, freak out, injure myself, shout and I still love it so unbelievably much. I don't know what it is about this game, it's just so amazing. That feeling after beating a boss you've been smacking your head against for hours, unlocking an awesome new item, beating a hard encounter all are experiences that make souls-likes what they are.

I usually HATE open world games. I despise them, frankly, but ELDEN RING is truly something special, they turned a genre which I dislike, into something I love. FromSoftware really did their homework and made an awesome experience that anyone can enjoy.

If you aren't a fan of dying repeatedly and not having your hand held all game, I wouldn't get this, but if you even SOMEWHAT like a challenge, you'll like this game.

95/100
One of the best games ever. Hard but fair. Amazing world, great music. The real feeling of accomplishment after defeating an enemy. Lots of freedom for trying out different builds. Relatively balanced
idk i just like soulsborne games and playing this with the crew is fun
The real Elden Ring was inside of us all along.

Therefore, try finger but hole.
Beautiful, words aren't enough to even begin to describe how marvelous of a game this is. At first I wasn't sure if Elden Ring was worth the sixty dollars, but upon my feeble 21 hours of experience I have come to the conclusion that this game is worth so much more. The effort and dedication that you pour all into playing this game that builds hours upon hours of work will be a play-through that you've never played through.
Forefathers, one and all.

BEAAAAR WITNESS!
good
amazing
TOO GOOD NOT TO PLAY (caps locks)
fuck you mohg and your dynasty  game of the year every year
The natural evolution of the souls genre. Incredible.
Still Maidenless
this game hard as hell but its fun
Great Story, Amazing Game! It takes some dedication to understand the mechanics but something new to explore around every corner.
All time GOTY

The game is a salvation for the soul and body for someone like me. I work 8 hours in the morning, meet deadlines in the evening, and with just 30 minutes of playing elden ring, I can live again.
margit the foot omen

i have skill issue in this game
This would be cool I think
this game makes me wanna die i love it
Amazing.
i like the moon lady (big butt)
Best game I have ever played
First playthrough I went completely blind, no walkthrough or guides. Felt totally lost, but through exploring the map and figuring out some of the lore, I had a lot of fun. If you choose to do this, I recommend getting a little leatherbound journal and taking notes while you talk to the NPCs about what they tell you. It adds to the fun of the game. Absolutely the best game I've ever played. Ran through the game over and over again, felt the desire to collect all the items, then did it. I can't recommend this game enough.
good game

Big good!

Elden RIng is not a game without imperfections. It contains multiple extremely flawed main bosses, such as the[spoiler]Godskin duo and the Elden Beast.[/spoiler]. That said, Elden Ring is as close to perfect as a game may ever get. It has well in excess of 100 hours worth of actual worthwhile content. The artwork is some of the best to ever appear in a video game. The soundtrack is incredible. The open world is better than that of any other game I've played. It doesn't rely on meaningless checkbox-based exploration. The bosses, although not perfect, are, as a whole, quite fun to fight, especially [spoiler]Morgott, Radagon, and Godfrey[/spoiler]. The legacy dungeons are amazing. Overall, Elden Ring is probably the best game I've played to date, and I'm excited to see what Fromsoft has in store for us with Shadow of the Erdtree.
10/10

give me more
really fun game, never thought i would like souls like games but extremely enjoyable, challenging and difficult gameplay that is enjoyable, sometimes enraging like godskin duo or some stupid basic enemy making me smash my controller, but other than that its my first souls like and i enjoyed it
A large epic adventure. There's many environments, monsters and people you'll meet in Elden Ring that will make you marvel. It will demand patience, and it is best if you use the community and their knowledge to guide you through the journey. Otherwise it would be too dense and too opaque.

Overall, it's an imaginative world that is worth experiencing!
Simply a amazing way to start this journey!
I have big sword, it go bonk.  unga bunga
B√£o
very nice
Yuh
it good
in my opinon, one of the best FromSoftware games, plus a fun open world adventure you can get lost in for hours and hours. DLC soon too!
Get good
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH

Elden Ring is a great game, nothing can really come close to it in terms of open world design and exploration (mostly, the only thing that does a better job in the exploration department would be Metro Exodus) and the gameplay (enemy design, character move-sets, etc. etc.) is incredible fun. 
Now I don't have much to say about the good things, this is Dark Souls 4, if that sounds good, have fun.
now the bad. 
I'm gonna sound like i'm going hard on it here but you criticise what you love the most.

What I have a problem with and this harms the gameplay too, is the sheer amount of repetition, The enemies and bosses you fight at the beginning of the game are unironically the same bosses you'll be fighting at the end. there are only 8~ish truly unique, un-repeated bosses in the game and it being an around 50+ hour experience means you'll spend a lot of time before encountering new enemies.

Now I'm not saying that the bosses that are copy pasted all over the place aren't good, it's just that it makes any subsequent encounters with them completely boring. By complete chance I ended up encountering almost every single boss in the game through their 'duplicate' versions first, so whenever I found the originals any sense of tension or challenge eats dirt.

Also another big problem I have with the game is the completely schizophrenic progression, If you listen to the game and 'follow the grace' without going full Skyrim and exploring then by the time you get around to what the game doesn't tell you is the first area everything will die incredibly quickly. Not to mention that the directly intended route will be several magnitudes more difficult until your level catches up.

There are also some problems with enemies occasionally having attacks that feel straight out of Sekiro but that's a whole other topic I don't want to get into here, this isn't the first time I've just said 'go watch this review' in a steam review but go watch Joseph Anderson's review of Elden Ring, It'll cover everything.
easy it not just in danile
I don't need to tell you why this game is good, its fromsoftware, everything miyazaki touches turns to gold
Girl talk to me :)
GOATED
Easily one of my top 10 games this decade for sure! Enjoyable, teaches you a lot of things (patience, problem solving etc), amazing art style and overall atmosphere!

Everything I hoped for in an Open World From game.

Looking foraward to the DLC.
Came out around, 2 years ago, and honestly was not that hyped about this game.
got it couple of months ago, played it few hours, and dropped - thought to my self that im sick of souls games.
after arguing with my friends, i decided to give it a go once more - ONE OF MY BEST DECISIONS FOR GAMING.

As im approaching the end of my first run, i can say for sure that FromSoftware made a game of the decade here, they took many good aspects of souls games and just improved on them to create a captivating game that makes you just bash your head until you beat every boss.

The game it self feels a bit "lesser" in terms of hardcore souls games like the others in the series (dark souls 1 + 3), but for sure there are some crazy ass bosses i was grinding my teeth to beat.

putting the combat aside, lets talk about the game visuals... they are just breath taking.
Every time i'm reaching a new area, i just cant hold my self from stopping for a minute or two just to glare at the beautiful scenery.. 

With all that in mind ye tarnished, GO and be the ELDEN LORD! 

FromSoftware - Thanks you.

10/10
Radagon's Balls, you must be 'ungry.
fuck the twin gargoyles

godlike---- After finishing this game a few months later I can confidently say that this is my favorite game that I have ever played. There truly is not enough to say about this game except that it has opened my eyes to the genre and I will definitely be playing more FromSoft games. excellent game.
I no longer feel joy.
Gonna give a thumbs up for my man Alexander. He was there every step and died a true warrior.

other then that, game is meh.
would love to replay the game again for the first time, that feeling of exploring a whole new world never gets old. 10/10
Fantastic game, it really sucks you in and won't let go.
''put these foolish ambitions to rest''

the 4th wall break is crazy
Just buy it.
w
yeah
This is my first souls like and the Lore, Combat, and Story of this game are out of this world. It was hard ngl but nothing beats the rush after trying to beat an annoying boss for hours and seeing "Demigod Felled". If it was ever too hard I just left and leveled up and came back to test something new. If there was ever a list of games I would recommend someone try in their lifetime. Elden Ring would be on the top of the list.
Good game.
Behold, dog
Burn the Erdtree to the ground
Play this game and never give up.
Difficult and frustrating, in all the best ways. Also a beautiful world.
This is the best game ever made.
Truly a masterpiece, Thank u !
If you haven't played this game then you have no purpose of living.
geht klar.
May Chaos take the World!!!
every thing about this game is annoying. why can't i bind my items to keyboard and i'm forced to scrolls through items? no quick bind for horse summonig. weird dodge window. you die you lost all runes unless you go back and pick it up otherwise on next death you lose runes from previous death, very encouraging to explore the world. and camera control.. worst i ever tried
.
yes

Git gud
yes
Fun
Elden ring is the greatest game of all time. It's not for everyone, but if it's for you, it is THE game for you. It's the type of game you beat once and instead of putting it down, you want to play again for like 2000 more hours. It's the G.O.A.T.
The online game is not what i expected, it takes hours to join a battle and the coop game is very poor with limited actions, leaving that aside the game is awesome!!
Big thumbs up personally.

Pros.
- tons of bosses to test new weapons u find on.
- tons of build variety and potential.
- nice weapon list with some pretty good ashes of wars to put on weapons.
- very enjoyable as a first play-through to explore the map and find new things.
- pretty good questlines.
- beautiful game depending on graphics settings or mods.
- enjoyable mods, seemless coop, convergeance, things like that.
- main bosses have pretty fun movesets if you're patient enough to learn.
- spirit ashes r helpful for ppl who want to play it more casually ( although controversial )
- amazing world building, most places when u enter u can see the end of the area to or where u end up going.
- cool enemy/boss/character design
- very good boss ost's ( not as good as bloodborne though zzz )
- interesting enough characters and lore in the world, although not clear enough, ( seek youtube )
- try fingers, but hole.

Cons. 
- Replaying the game and going through the map can be boring depending on yourself. for me knowing the game inside out and the locations of stuff makes it difficult to play again since i know to look for, first playthrough was a go explore now its a go from A to B to get this then kill boss and repeat. 
- good luck without fextra life interactive map in some situations. 
- not enough in the open world to keep you interested in replaying, the only good places r the main areas.
- the bosses aside from main ones are pretty poor considering there is 165 and most of them arent single unique ones. im not mad was just a bit disappointing considering there are stuff like 2 astels?
- no 40 vigor no fun
- endgame scaling goes crazy considering morgott can be really easy with scaling and then all of a sudden it feels double the difficulty when going to fire giant.
- summons can ruin the game on a first playthrough and sour the game for you.


Still though, i love the game. just have some issues with it.
DLC will be goated though.
i wanna off myself ngl but its good

Probably one the greatest RPG/Souls games ever made. 10/10. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is amazing, and the story is phenominal. If you like Souls-likes this is clearly the game to play in 2024. From Soft really knocked this one out of the park. Don't be maidenless, buy it now before the DLC drops.

Ranni is feet Goddess
You've most likely already heard the trite expression "Elden Ring isn't Dark Souls 4, its 4, 5 and 6 in one" and I'm tempted to say that might even be a bit of an understatement. I'm not massive on open worlds and even for this one there was a good 10 or 20 hours in the middle that I was bored to tears tempted to just look up where to head next, I believe the main thing to consider if you have prior experience with especially the metroidvania esque souls games, you have to abandon some of the mindset with those games in regards to exploration and combat, this game is a masterclass of an open world games but it still comes with many of the fallings of the genre - hard to balance areas with some being far to easy or far to difficult depending on when you choose to tackle them, a lot of liminal moments (joke intended) between that you may find boring with an open world by design never ever being able to be as dense as a more linear game etc. If you look past your own biases however, you will most likely find Elden Ring an incredibly fulfilling experience, nigh on the best combat present in an open world game, an incredible story and lore even for the very very high bar other from games set, and goes without saying but drop down gorgeous, not only from a graphical point of view(beware there are some performance issues due to this) but from an awe inspiring art direction. Lastly, accessibility options are to use per taste, something is only cheating (summons, "cheese" load outs) if you believe you've cheated yourself, if not, go wild the options are in the game for a reason, it is a video game not a test.
10/10 would let ranni have my mushroom
I loooooove this gaaaame but it makes me maaaaad sometimes
This game is brilliant in many ways, but not for the gameplay. 

First lets start of with whats genuinely good about the game right now:
- amazing soundtracks
- a lot of weapon diversity and playstyle chosing
- lots of route finding
- a LOT of random stuff in the overworld giving rewards (its also a con cause of missing semi important items for builds is VERY probable)
-  well written story and Lore for everything in the verse right now
- good ending choices that have a deeper meaning for the players decision


Now lets go to the bad aspects that I found out from my gameplay so far (started Farum Azula  and completed everything else before it + Haligtree) :

- Middle and Endgame have LOTS of tedious stuff not out of difficulty but out of pure frustration => less fun in the endgame with the most amazing bosses in the game (Malenia, Morgott, ect.)
-  The scaling for the different areas is inconsistent. You're supposed to do Calid before Altus and Leyndell, yet the enemies there are a LOT stronger than the ones in Altus
- build options are hidden throughout the game and thus make respec-ing into another more favorable built of yours a necessity, which is not a good design with limited respecs
- the Arenas are genuinely the worst ones in any Fromsoft game like genuinely
- movement feels clunky due to target locking, making the rather weird option of free camming the better feel, but also significantly more harder for the average player who doesnt play claw
-  player level scaling is not intuitive. "What level am I supposed to be?" in areas with Vigor checks and also high density of enemies happenes countless times throughout the gameplay and the fact that you HAVE to be at a point in Vig. where 2 Flasks dont even full heal you... lets just say that doesnt help the feeling a player has
- broken weapons and limited uses till Farum Azula due to limited (somber) smith stones => cant pivot to other weapons for a LONG time 
- parrys feel awful on some enemies, especially Malenia. I genuinely enjoy parrys in general, but when the timing for parrys isnt the same across the board, why am I even supposed to play with shields in this game and not just go a dex/strength build or mega prepare a Intellligence built, it just doesnt make any sense to have a skill expression like that in the game when it isnt across the board and you need to literally relearn it for a majority of enemies
- a lot of repetitiveness in Bosses, Catacombs/graves, normal enemies, heck even weapons and spells
- unnecessary pacouring with the worst movement controls of any game I have played


In short: I am not a fan of how this game feels to play, how it makes the play have to REALLY think on what build to go, how to prepare (if at all) for bigger Bosses and what to expect from enemies around the boss. Very unfun and useless parts keep appearing in this game as is and give the player a miniscule reward in most cases and at best 15min of wandering in an area trying to figure out a "puzzle" (hint: its a dark tunnel or an invisible wall).

Love everything else about the game BESIDES the gameplay and thats why I cannot recommend this game for majority of players who want a good time, want to enjoy a chill game where they have a challenge but get rewarded. This game is none of these and is just a pure headache for anyone not taking it seriously.
No clue how this won GOTY honestly, I do have high hopes for the DLC though in terms of fixing problems.

BEST GAME OUT THERE
11/10
There is nothing more to say, you've seen all the reviews.
best game ever
lovely

cant wait for dlc
Best game ever since the world is created
has big sword 10/10
masterpiece.
you're maidenless
yes
what is this elders rings I've heard all about?
FromSoftware's formula makes for a unique experience when combined with a truly open world. While the end result is imperfect (the second half of the game is noticeably worse than the first in terms of enemy variety, rewarding exploration, and difficulty that inspires a sense of accomplishment instead of just relief when you overcome it), this might still be one of the overall best action RPGs in recent memory.

Elden Ring is also by far the most accessible game FromSoftware has ever made on account of things like spirit summons that can trivialize most bosses and the ability to overlevel a lot of content you find difficult by simply exploring instead of grinding. So, if you're looking for an entry point into soulslikes, look no further. If all else fails, you can always fall back on multiplayer co-op to overcome the game's most ludicrous challenges.
its really hard
fun
The world is vast and very interesting to explore. The fights are hard and thrilling at the same time. I don't remember a game gripping me this hard since Skyrim.
This is the best souls game !
My uncle told me that he sold the Elden Ring at a pawn shop to get some cigarettes
masterpiece, buy now if you like souls likes, very much easier than other souls games but still enjoyable due to the large world and bosses.
this game is good
i have had it for less than a week and have nearly played 50 hours already
it is rather addicting to say the very least
there are some crashing issues but other than that i would say it is the perfect game for its genre
action open world mmorpg at its best
its alright
very cool
game is fucked! Dont play tried coop don't work fix stupid game. but on the contrary it has a lot of hard bosses not only did it take me this long to beat mad pumpkin but he has made me sorrowful
Tell you what. Look at how many hours I have in 'Elden Ring'. 

And then you tell me if you think I like the game.
I am noob, and it's my first souls-like game ever. It is indeed hard... however...

The game is beautiful. Full of mystery, challenges, interesting mechanics, content, and so on. I tend to give up easily when the challenge is too hard, but seriously... that thrill when you finally get to defeat a mighty foe is amazing. Yeah, looking at you Maliketh.

There are some issues with the game however. Some assets and boss are reused a bit too much. Some part of quests and stories are too complexes.

I've not yet finished the game (stucked on the last boss), but I would gladly recommend this masterpiece.

Good job devs!
be ware good game ahead

You need two screens for this game: one to play on, the other one to scroll the wiki.

liar ahead
Game is difficult. I had a great time playing it.

It's pretty good
fuwwy

Just a great, great game. Developers have clearly had a vision in mind an they have been able to work that to completion. While there are some divisive additions and designs, to me this should be seen as an amazing improvement to an already great formula that is the souls games. I have gladly spent many and will spend more hours adventuring and exploring in this amazing gameworld.
Insane game, a must have!
Still waiting for DLC...
Great game, but steep learning curve
good game
While clearly not the worst From Software game, it's by far the most overrated. You can ignore the fact that most dungeons are the same dungeon copy-pasted or, in general, how much the same assets are re-used over and over. That is nearly inevitable in an open-world game.
But you cannot ignore the fact that you are not free to explore the world without risking of soft-locking most of the sub-quests (which the game gives no indication whatsoever) or without risking of overleveling.
But the worst offender in this game are the boss fights: really bad designed. They are hard but not challenging; it does not matter how good you are, if your character is not one of the meta builds you cannot defeat most of the main bosses. And no, being forced to follow a meta is not good game design (yes, even Let Me Solo Her is a meta build). Another very big problem with boss (and mid boss) fights is the spectacularization over gameplay. Most of the time you are forced to watch the boss doing all its acrobatics maneuvers while rolling away (yeah, shields don't really matters anymore), waiting, waiting and waiting for a split second window of opportunity to strike back, all while fighting against a camera view not intended for such choreography.
We are far away from the tactical and metodical fighting mechanic of Dark Souls. This is an extremely disappointing game.
If only I could be so grossly incandescent..
Amazing.
yes
..
Could this be a dog?
Challenging but very rewarding. Well worth picking up and playing, especially if its your first souls game.
i love this game
strong enemy ahead, Solder of God, Rick

from maidenless to maiden guide 10/10
point down
10/10 growing roots out of my ass while playing
good game.
good fun
Pisses me the hell off. Black Kindred Spirit is bullshit. I used to like Soulslikes but i hate them now.
The gameplay is amazing. I think everyone can agree on that. Highly recommend this game even if you hate dying and losing all your runes...

However,
The quality of life UI/UX in the menus is "E" tier at best.
Press G to open your map.. but Esc to close it again, because NOW G opens a help dialog in map. 
This is one of many examples of the thought that went into the menu/features. 
Also - This game has secret controller/keyboard configs you CANNOT change and DO NOT show up in anywhere but maybe the tutorial. only to be forgotten later. 
I have had to look up so many hidden controls or try and figure out WHY oh WHY can I not use my cool ash of war on my one-handed sword while also wielding a shield, just because it also has the parry skill...

anyway. I do love the game. But if you are going to really be bothered by a bad UI/UX experience in a game. Maybe hold onto your $$$.

ELDEN RIIIING OH ELDEN RIIIIING
 To keep it short, this game is basically the culmination of Fromsoft's experience with "Soulsborne" as a whole, particularly improving on Dark Souls 3. 
It's easily the most accessible souls game thus far, with it being open world, and having a "play it at your own pace" attitude, as well providing tons of get out of jail free cards for newbies; from spirit ash summons to weapons that are broken OP in PvE, such as the "Rivers of Blood" Katana or the "Blasphemous Blade" greatsword, or even assistance in the form of online co-op with a buddy. As such, ER can simultaneously be the most difficult souls game ever, OR the easiest souls game ever, depending on how much you want to take advantage of these tools. At the very least, I'm proud of myself for managing to beat the main story as a STR build without using any spirit ashes as per me being a souls veteran, but again, it was purely my choice; mimic tear and Banished Knight Oleg can bail you out if it's too hard for ya. I'm still feeling torn in some aspects about the game though; no dragon in the game can match Midir from DS3 and I still think that balancing the game around spirit ashes make it preposterously difficult times, particularly against the likes of the infamous Malenia; but I guess there's already plenty of youtubers and and "letmesoloher" that have beaten her without any cheap tricks as well. All in all, a fantastic game, and well worth the money at $40-60. Can't wait for shadow of the erdtree
Get good.    easiest of the souls games, but best story in my opinion
placidusax stole my yeezys
its real fun
if you never play another fromsoft game, play this one
i never thought i'd enjoy a FromSoft game or a souls-like in general but i feel in love with Elden Ring. Also GG beat malenia first try :3c
Made me want to brake my controller into a million pieces, grind those pieces together in a fine paste, add salt, pepper, garlic, and other spices and feed them to my dog. 11/10

Edit: I got banned??

I was playing offline Elden Ring modded after I completed the game for a few runs, I turned off anti cheat, created a new character and went at it for about 2 weeks. I got bored and wanted to go back online to play some coop. I deleted my mods, deleted my modded character and verified game files before opening and got the message "Prohibited Alterations detected". But this seems to be a common issue and seeing as I deleted all my files I should be fine. The message also said the warning would not go away for a while so I thought I was in the clear. I played for about 2 weeks and got the message "Your account has been penalized" for 180 days

huh?? I rarely play online anyway so it dont matter too much for me, but that's ridiculous. To this day I still dont know what I got flagged for. 

It would make everyone's lives easier if the warning actually told you what you got flagged for, so you can get rid of said items if you have them. I thought I was in the clear after deleting everything except my vanilla characters. (which I havent touched in the mod)

All this and there are still blatant cheaters roaming about in the game without being banned.

Customer support is also ridiculously slow. I don't think I'm getting unbanned anytime soon
game good i think
yuh
One of the best story games in gaming history
Took 150 hours but i finally 100%'ed the game. So good I'm gonna burn my house down and use it to buy the game again and again.
I like this ring game thing pretty cool
why cant i romance dung eater
I like this game :)
Goated Game

where tf are we supposed to go?
Very fun, I would recommend to anybody trying to get into the souls genre as this is a pretty good entry game. It's not as hard as the other games but is still as fun. And once you finish the actual game you can move on to the hundreds of mods that can alter your playthrough. There are even a few like elden ring convergence and elden ring reforged that give you a completely fresh playthrough of elden ring.
this game makes me slightly angry
she bouta get my elden thang
Never bothered reviewing a game before, but FromSoftware went above and beyond to craft a game that towers above the rest in scope, theme, mechanics, music, story and everything in (the lands) between.  This game single-handedly pulled me back into single players games, having not completed one since Resident Evil 7, and before that, Dragon Age Origins.  What a joy to play and experience for the first time.  

As frustratingly hard as some encounters may be, the prospect of discovering a new piece of lore, the flavor text on a dope item, a valuable upgrade, or parkour-ing your way to another hidden quest or boss, made me never waver in determination to see what was around the next corner.

Bravo.  This is one that will be remembered fondly for a long, long time. I Haven't felt like this about a game since the golden age of SquareSoft games.
 I think its skibidi

Its a fun and calming game to just chiilax too. Nothing stressful about it.

More content per square foot of game map than any game I have ever played. Hard and frustrating at times, you get such a sense of satisfaction after learning a boss, or mobs mechanics and finally defeating them after many tries. Some things can be clunky, jumping puzzles sometimes suck due to the games physics, and the camera can be special at times, but not enough to not suggest Elden Ring to anyone. My favorite of the souls game to date by far. I hope From Software keeps the game going in the same direction in the future. 9.5/10
Fucking great Game

Good game.

could this be a
review?
My friend sat on my face while waiting for invaders 10/10 would recommend
I started playing the game over a year ago, got mad and stopped. Came back and started a new game because I forrgot how to play. I have been awake for over 28 hours, I am on my third controller and my infant won't shut tf up.

Platinuming this on the PS5 was one of the best experiences I've had with a game. I just had to get it for the PC once I saw the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC trailer.

Good game, fps lock sucks, anti-cheat lag sucks

Hot take: Rune drop on death needs to be default but optional
Beat this multiple times over on PlayStation and now going to do the exact same thing on PC. Nothing else to say besides it's Elden Ring.
I own this on Xbox and PC I have spent hundreds of hours on the Xbox playing it. If The Lands Between call they are worth the visit.

This game is for those who aren't too sure about playing a souls game and want to experience it for the first time because the open world allows you to get stronger before you fight a boss which helps a lot! Honestly I love this game and keep playing it so hope you get it and enjoy it :D

One of the most unique gaming experiences you can have. If you can overcome the initial learning curve, the game's mechanics are the best in the genre and the combat is so rewarding!

The Soulsborne evolution!
What can I say about Elden Ring that hasn't been said already? So many different areas to explore, and things to discover in the open world, especially the weapons, there's many unique weapons and builds to test out which offers this game some insane replay value. On top of that you have some of the best level design and bosses that the souls games have to offer. Elden Ring is basically a culmination of all the things the fans of the souls franchise love, but with so much more. This being FromSoftware's biggest game, the ambitions definitely make up for one hell of an experience. This is not only one of my favorite from the franchise, but one of the best games I've ever played.

Its good.

9.5/10
Saw a guy pointing at a tree and it changed my life
Hey, I'm not sure it entirely has the flow/balance of the other games, you can't really perfectly outskill it.

But it's also good enemies are more realistic, don't wait for you to fight one enemy, attack like relentless other people would, don't give you any pattern to really counter a lot of the time, but that imo is a new thing and good, cause it's realistic, like fighting real people.

So you gotta be smart, unfair, like you are surviving in a real world, D&D style, and research stuff you can use/get to give yourself the edge and win, it's quite fun, and the world is really expansive and lovely, if a little of a pain to navigate sometimes.

Enjoy!
fucking 80h played, now file is corruped, please resolve this fucking issue
fantastic game
Like a lot
shitty ass game id rather stick a rusty nail in my urethra
i love elden ring
awesome
amazing game, amazing company, no micro-transactions, whats not to like?
There is not a game that compares to this. I'm not a fan of souls-likes, but this is undeniably one of or the best game ever made.

Didn't enjoy losing 100k souls to doot boys in haligtree though but I guess it is what it is.

masterpiece
Game is a 10/10 as it is .... even better when you use the Co-op Mod to play with friends and you can all use the mount at the same time, explore together... drop in/drop out Co-op... It's amazing.
i let the fingers finger me so i'll give it a thumbs up
Beautiful game, pretty big map. The combat loop is just boring af.

souls-like, breath of the wild
it's not hard when you develop character beforehand. Yeah it's still challenging but playable and it's fun.
Elden Ring is a game that takes you on a beautiful journey with thrilling combat, amazing views, and an engaging plot that wants you to continue playing more. This is my second time playing this game and I doubt it will be my last.
Have over 100 hours on console as well. Just too much fun
Played this game on xbox, and got all achievements. I liked it so much that i got it on PC and managed to do it again. I keep finding more items that i missed every new game+. I am stoked for the upcoming DLC. Great open world and atmosphere.
plain and simple a great game.

Good Game
.
This is absolutely 2022 GAME OF THE YEAR but it is still the best game to play throughout this year. I must say that for all people and gamers out there must try this out.
338 Hours to 100% this bbc of a game. Worth it

I mean I liked it enough to get a tattoo of it, so I guess it's alright

After the DLC comes out this will be my most played game on steam. Took me a whole month to beat Malenia but I did it.

One of the best, if not THE best, souls-like game. It definitely can test your patience at times, just about the same as the others, so veterans to the souls series and other Miyazaki games will love this just as much as the others. And for those who haven't played any souls like before, don't be afraid to give it a try, after a while you'll start to love the pain that this game, and the rest of the souls series has to offer.
Funny kill people :)
They really knocked it out of the park with this game. This is the first of the souls series of games that I have really gotten into. I've made it through NG+4 on the PS5 and just had to get it on steam for my PC to play on my new steam deck. I absolutely can not wait for the new DLC to come out and get to experience a whole new slew of challenging enemies.
No words needed... its perfect JUST perfect.
fun!
play
I promise I'll play it.

Game of the Year in 2022 for a reason. Play and you will find out!
You know this game is worth it, why even read comments
BOSS FUN

Seeing this George R.R. Martin collab come to life was enthralling. This will definitely feel like a Souls game, but some of the enemies, world details, and plot elements remind you of Martin's other works. Elden Ring is much bigger than the other souls games, but the quality-of-life changes and co-op make this long haul doable.
Hours of pulling hair out and breaking controllers but its ight.
Challenging Yet Rewarding. This is easily on the the top 5 Games of All Time.
I would recommend searching up some guides on yt for a much better experience. This game is a 10/10.

i bust a nut each time malenia dies

The game itself is Great, But the bundled easy anti-cheat system locks my system up 50% of the time upon it's loading. This apparently is very common, it should not be accepted or tolerated by the end users or the game developers it puts a bad mark on an otherwise overwhelmingly great game.
Bonk?

This game is so insanely amazing, words cannot accurately describe it. Even if I don't pick it up for weeks (or months) at a time, whenever I come back I instantly remember why I love it so much. It's all the incredible gameplay of the souls games, but with so much more freedom and variety. I've rage quit so many times that I've lost count and yet I know it will stay in my top 3 all-time favorite games forever. 1000/10 recommend
Toes?

Amazing
Replaying this game years after launch, and I gotta say, it's just a 10/10.

Until Elden Ring I always said Bloodborne was the best game Fromsoft has ever made, and now it's so clearly Elden Ring.

If you like action RPGs, you absolutely should be buying this game.
ring elden
Try Fingers But Hole
Obviously still very early impressions for how long of a game this is meant to be. I have explored a decent chunk of the starting area and have faced quite a few dungeon bosses now.

I have become a from software fan in the past couple of years, Having played first bloodborne and then sekiro - and now understand the joy that these games bring to many, including myself. I think Sekiro is one of the few 10/10 games I have ever played, and I could see myself potentially enjoying Elden Ring to that same level.

The worlds that from software are able to create never cease to amaze me. The atmosphere in this game immediately makes itself known with the big glowing tree you can see in the horizon pretty much all the time. The lore begs for you to learn more, and piece together the bits of information available. As for gameplay, fighting tree sentinel at level 1 was fun. Struck memories of gyobu in Sekiro. I can see why so many were upset at launch now, which makes it even funnier knowing I had to actively seek out his attention so he would start fighting me. The core of these games are all the same, Fight big bad over and over, learning everything about him until you know what he is going to do before even he knows. And using that information to punish them. Spirit ashes are a great optional addition to the game that are there for most optional bosses I've come across, although some boss are restricted in their use. These give you summons to help if you are new. This makes the game pretty newbie friendly, even if the boss move sets are sometimes annoying to deal with. Would recommend to anyone like me as a relatively new fan of these types of games that is still considering whether or not to buy, and would cautiously recommend to anyone looking to get into the franchise. I still think bloodborne is the easier game, but I can see the larger mass appeal in Elden Ring.

Greatest game of all time
bad
wow
Very Hard but rewarding

yes
Pain
Have you played souls game before? then you have played this. Only open world is new and in my mind this is not unique anymore to make a difference. Also the parry window is terrible. With open world to explore you dont want to be locked to initial build and make wtf number of starter chars to see what works best for you re-spec master at a starter location for minute one is a must for this game and there is none. Right now I am farming runes at lvl 86 and its not fun and this is all to see what weapon I found so far I like. Result a strange semi mage semi strength build with 32str  25 int 28 vig 29 indurance 19 dex and 25 mind, sucky damage and pain in the ass huge boss fights where camera goes wazzzzzooo particularly if the fat ass boss jumps
Love Love Love it
A real artwork friends, if you don't give a chance for any souls like game, its a good opportunity straight ahead~


bosses easyer then darksouls 3 but its good but mogh is hard
Elden ring has gotten me into soulslike games. Undoubtedly the best game I have ever played, highly recommend
i love all the bosses except burial watchdog duo
co op bad game very good
just so you know i broke 2 mouses and a keyboard in this game

So i played this game on my xbox and absolutely loved it man. The exploration is nuts and the creativity is rewarding. I could go on and on about this game. Man Ive been trying to get it on my pc but i havent had the chance. Also I can not wait for the dlc. If I had to choose a game to play for the rest of my life , it would be this game for sure.

Elden Ring. Nuff said.
Amazing game, you won't regret buying it
xfv
this game is like making love to your dead grandpa, very horrific but fun
bonk

It's actually amazing how many QoL things this game has that make it much more enjoyable than any other previous Souls-likes.

I'm not saying this is the best Souls-like, that is very much debatable, but things such as instant fast-travel (no item needed, nor it is unlocked late game or anything), Statues of Marika (no painful runbacks to bosses), clearing groups of enemies gives you back some healing flasks (just play the game aka beat enemies and explore), Spirit Ashes, the gentle guidance of grace, the map and NPCs being showed in, all of these things make the game more enjoyable so that you don't have to suffer through rather questionable design decision and just, you know, explore and beat bosses. And there's plenty more that I can't think of right now, and probably much more that need to be added. 

The game definitely doesn't need a traditional "difficulty slider" as the game mechanics can influence how hard or easy the game can be. Have a tough time with a boss or an area? Go somewhere else and level up a bit on easier enemies. Need just a bit more damage or something that can take aggro or tank? Summon spirit ashes. There's plenty of mechanics like this that you can opt in or out of in order to modify your experience to your liking.

Excellent bosses, impeccable lore and storytelling, various weaponry and armor (can't wait to check out new weapon types in the DLC), amazing locations, just a great game overall!
The game is only as hard as you let it be.

I would recommend this game to anyone. Whether you're familiar with these types of games or not, Elden Ring is a perfect game that i believe has something for everybody. This is my favourite game and I strongly believe every gamer should experience this game at least once.
I mean it has everything. Swords,pots,and magic, what more can anyone ask for!!
Axe goes bonk
good

Good game
The game is really good if you put time into it, of course not an easy game but just find how you want to play and then build that way. You can always switch your build later so no worries, after a lot of amazing bosses and annoying deaths, i did beat the main game. There was a moment in the game i was really frustrated because my build i had the whole game was no longer good enough or i was not good with the build, so i stopped playing a while and eventually came back and switched builds to beat the game. This game isn't 100 perfect and a few flaws but i got the game for 40 bucks and have 90 hours or so and id say it was well spent. If you are not a patient person i would not recommend the game, but if you got some time like 2 to 3 hours a day i think it would suit you well. It is really rewarding to win so go for it and enjoy. Rating wise 8.5/10
Great character creator! Cant wait to play the game

edit: just made my character! time to start!
Entertaining but hard, but you should expect this playing a FromSoft game
1 try Maliketh
1 try Godfrey
1 try Mohg
Almost 1 try Malenia, I was cocky and wanted to finish her with a light jump attack, I thought it was a pretty easy fight. She dodged, instant hard punish, then i 've been shit on 20 times before i killed her...

I loved it

this game is boring, empty open world, backtracking galore, and everything kills you in one hit? who made this garbage
ADDICTION
An amazing game!  Long time souls fans may find this one a bit on the easier side, but that is do to it being way more accessible to the general public.  Even if it is a bit on the easy side for a souls game, the exploration and environmental storytelling make up for it!
Alexander :(
Its a really fun and challenging game, and tbh it's one of my favorite games ever made. The only issue that i have with this is it requires an xbox controller and is almost impossible to play without one. I'm lucky that i already have an xbox but some people don't and thats just extra money wasted to play this game. It's like buying a game for $40, then not being allowed to play the game without buying an in app purchase anyway... oh wait, thats almost exactly like how it is. Its a good game but if we can make it a little more pc oriented on pc that would be nice. Thats all for my long ah rant üíÄ
Finally beat Margit

This game has the most content ive seen in a while, The lore and imagery make the game amazing. If your reading this I heavily recommend you get this game, Have fun!

Yes, Awesome game PvE wise. Don't do PvP. People are lagging their asses off 95% of the time and you get hit from 100 hits at the same time them being physical melee hits, castings, ranged attacks mean while host is running around loading up stand still spells.
Doesn't get any better
I knew nothing about the story or previous FromSoftware titles.  My friend let me try it out at his house.  I was initially uncertain but after a few hours I knew I had to own this game.   Still working on completing main story.  Really looking forward to the DLC coming out soon too.
great game one of the best games ever but hard

fuck maliketh
Chase the elden ring as famileee. Togethaaa we will defeat the very gohs!
I don't know whats so alluring about the real world that gives them all a fetish for it. Its just not that nice out there as it used to be. Come find your respite among your brethren tarnished, and find yourself in a world that gives what you are worth.

It feels like Guantanamo all over again but with a mix of Vietnam. Sadly the developers haven't landed in a Chinese Reeducation Camp
This game (and honestly all other Souls games) change you. That sounds cheesy or whatever, but there is SOMETHING about these games that just cannot be compared to anything else. For anyone intimidated because you've heard these games are tough and brutal, the real experience is overcoming the hard stuff and finally achieving victory. Not only that but the world, the music, the tragic characters, are all captivating and I think there's something to love here for everybody. It's worth an honest shot. This stands to be my favourite game possibly ever. I've played 130 hours and will continue to play, have pre-ordered the deluxe DLC and still listen to hours upon hours of lore deep dive content. Just... yeah. This game absolutely slaps.
shall be one of the best games of the year
A Masterpiece of the Decade

Elden Ring is, in my opinion, one of the best games of the last decade. The open world of this game is simply incredible, inspiring a desire to explore every corner, unlike some other open-world games that fail to captivate. The game's art direction is astounding, and the music is of exceptional quality. Every element of Elden Ring has been crafted with care and attention to detail, making it a standout title in the gaming world. This game is a must-play for anyone who appreciates the artistry and immersive experience of a well-designed open world.

Elden Ring is objectively the greatest video game of all time and my personal second favorite, next to Bloodborne. There's just no other game like it or better than it. I've completed all of FromSoftware's Soulsborne games, and I would say this is the culmination of all of them.

I platinumed/100% completed this game in just one week on PlayStation 5 during its release week, and my run was in the top 0.6% completion overall at that time. I found a game-boosting side job and earned a few bucks from it. It ruined every RPG that came out and that I played after it to this day. What else can I say? That's how great it is!

I wish I could put it as my top game of all time, but Bloodborne holds a special place in my heart, so it won't happen anytime soon. I've spent hundreds of hours on PlayStation 5 and will still spend more on Steam PC as I'm preparing a new character for the next DLC (Shadow of the Erdtree).

The only downside to this game is that it will ruin your fun and experience with other RPGs that come out afterward. You haven't played it yet? What are you playing other than this? Stop whatever mediocre games you're playing right now! Don't sleep on it! Go grab it NOW!
You get better till you quit

15/10 will masochist again
MASTERPIECE (McLOVIN APPROVED)
hard af to get armor and only armor lol
STRENGHT IS COOL, DEX IS COOL, ARCANE IS COOL
Masterpiece
RAHHHHHHHHHH
Makes me want to cave my head in with a rock.
Great game 100% recommend. Very hard and challenging but well worth playing. Runs great on steam deck
Finger but whole
played it on my PS5 goated game pls get if you wanna play one of the best games of all time!
wooooow
It's a good game it just has too much garbage to filter through. If you're experienced at these games you're also going to have to gimp yourself a lot to find any enjoyment out of it otherwise its going to be too easy. The modifier stacking in this game is insane, its practically Nioh levels of insanity where you can basically bypass the combat system with diablo power stacking through buffs, rings, consumables ect. The ashes of war are also far too powerful and are easily spammed without consequence. Most of your power is defined by them where neutral play matters far less.

Most of the open world is forgettable and redundant only there to pad the game time and appeal to a different audience that enjoys that kind of experience. Liurnia of the Lakes is by far the worse example of this and its always a slog to go through even when you're skipping through 90% of it. The underground areas are also vapid derivative empty spaces of time wasting. The worst is Nokstella, a complete waste of time that you cant even use the horse to trudge through. Most of these areas only serve to plod along the plot of the most self indulgent unlikeable character in the game. It's all extremely disappointing.

The pacing also suffers as well. Most of the game feels too samey in terms of enemy power level where the player starts to outscale them until you get to mountaintops of the giants and then the enemy power curve leaps exponentially.  Caelid, Luiurina, Altus, Leyndell Capital all feel very similar in terms of enemy power. The bridge between them and Mountaintops is supposed to be Volcano Manor/Mt Gelmir but even that feels way undertuned compared to mountaintops. My issue with this is that it really feels like the game doesn't start until you get to mountaintops as the stuff you did beforehand feels irrelevant. Playing through NG+ cycles only makes the gap wider and its a real problem I have with this game. 

With all that being said this game is still worth it despite all of these problems. The boss design is solid and the movement options like crouching and jumping feel good and don't overly oppress the core dark souls combat. Legacy dungeons are by far the best this game offers, areas like Stormveil Castle, Farum Azula, Miquella's Haligtree, Leyndell Capital are very well designed and are worth trudging through the open world to get to. 

The core combat is still dark souls and the formula is very addicting where you can spend hours of fulfillment killing hordes of enemies. Although the game does prod you into abusing cheesy mechanics or diablo power stacking, you never have to and there is a level of satisfaction gained after achieving a certain level of mastery over the challenges the game puts you through. I think this is what keeps me hooked to this game above all else. 


Best game of all time
Good Game
Comet Azur go brrrr
I want Malenia to step on me
mmmmmmm dog!
Absolutly Incredible art piece as well as video game 9.6/10
Fun game and fantastic world.  Exploration is definitely rewarded.
Difficulty is on the high side but not horribly unfair.
For those who don't want the challenge but would like to try the game mods are just a google search away and there are some that lower the difficulty or nearly eliminate it if you just want closer to tourist mode.  If you go this route I do recommend trying the game later on with mods off once you have some experience with the mechanics.
While some starting classes are more powerful out the gate than others I recommend going with whichever catches your fancy or fits what you believe to be your style.  All starting classes ultimately become whatever you make them through gear and leveling.
With the DLC around the corner it is a good time to get started.  Though waiting for a deal once the DLC hits is also an option.

Overall definitely recommend for any gamer who likes swords, sorcery, and exploration.
Elden Ring? Oh, please. That so-called "challenge" was child's play for someone of my caliber. Every achievement in that game was practically handed to me on a silver platter. From conquering bosses with my eyes closed to navigating the open world with one hand tied behind my back, it was all too easy. I finished the game before most players even figured out how to swing a sword properly. Maybe next time they'll make a game worthy of my skills, but until then, I'll bask in the glory of effortlessly conquering Elden Ring.
top tier every foe is a weak foe
Amazing. A rare 10/10 game.
Great for both experienced souls-like players and newcomers to the genre.
Just buy it already!

All hail Alexander :)
Perfect Game
Yo this game's pretty good
dxwas
Game rules
upon my name as godfrey
good!!!!!!
this game will give you ........ ENJOYABLE PAIN
Truly my favorite fromsoft game. As a late comer to these games, if you haven't played a souls game before or have a friend that is hesitant to play them absolutely start with this game. It made me an instant fan.
so good
Beautiful, enthralling and fun to play. Like all FromSoft games, it brings a great deal of satisfaction from putting in the effort to get good and beat something that's taken you down.
BEAR WITNESS!!!!!!!
NA HEEL!!!!!!!!!!
Is good <3
Still got no maiden though ...
BRILLIANT 

The game is great run good and I'm very excited for the DLC
Its decent. Senior is better
Really fun.
Masterpiece from Fromsofware, take Darksouls 3 and make it open world and just as interesting in lore and still challenging in gameplay, and you have Elden Ring. 100% recommended
best game
great game
fun
HARD BUt fun and new dlc
What you liked about this game? Yes, victim role-play
broke two keyboards 10/10
incredible replay value
hell yea
Best Game EVer!
Very fun and challenging to play
gud
You're better off just flushing your money down the toilet...
Save the risk of your sanity and go play a game with good developers like Undertale.
great game
it should be a crime that one of the best games ever made has a prominent character named The Dung Eater
.
Good game

HATE
runs like shit, playing feels like being 40% of cops wives, i'd pay double for it if i had to
it's a game
bought it, downloaded it. jumped on, finished tutorial. got called maidenless 3 times within 10 minutes of game time. 10.1/10
boss design is mid and game mechanics are almost on par with dark souls 2
it's ok

i think i got aids but good game
top 5 games oat
Absolutely fantastic game with great looking visuals and more importantly that extremeley rewarding combat you have come to know from this studio. I have beat this game before, but I missed it so much that I bought it again at full price to get ready for the upcoming DLC as I'm never going back to console.  This game is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise and sales it has received.  

Is this game going to be for everyone? NO, It is not a game that everyone will find fun and rewarding. It can be challenging in some areas but if you stick with it and give it an actual effort you might find a game you can sink hundreds of hours in.

Can't wait to see what they've cooked up for Shadow Of The Erdtree
One of the best games I have ever played
So...  100 hours and a platinum later...  and starting another NG loop to be ready for early game summons...  I kinda get the game now.  It makes sense.  It's much better than I thought - especially coming at it blind, but it definitely has a "learning curve" for souls vets that makes it frustrating at first.  It breaks many of the rules, but the heart is there.
goated and better with mods
One of the best games I've ever played. Masterpiece.
truly an obscure underrated indie hidden gem
Yo why the dogs in Caelid look like Scrappy Doo in the live action movie lmao
Play this game if ur maidenless
what an adventure, really mind blowing characters and amazing experience.
I would definitely recommend elden ring to any player who love rpg and story line progression games. the entire map is open world, there are hundred of weapons, talismans, armors, and even secret areas that you can get without fighting a single boss. if you are looking for a fun and easy way to pass time i would definitely recommend elden ring.
good game but im like lil kids a lil more soo i had to refund it for chiled p** but good 109m of play time
Great game, a bit difficult, but is super fun so far and can't wait to get further in!
good game
gut
:)
[h1]Jaw-dropping experience. [/h1]
Not the best combat out there, you will die, and i mean, a lot. Elden Ring is so rewarding, so fulfilling.
You will have to go back and forth multiple times, because you are probably under-level, but that's why this game is so unique and special. I never thought i would like souls-like games, but exploring this open-world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before. it is truly remarkable.
Every location you explore is incredibly built and designed, with tons of secrets, hidden places and doors, multiple precious items, and incredible views to see.
I truly think everyone should play this game, atleast once, in his life, it is simply incredible, something taken from fantasy books.

Just have in mind that you're most of the times, the victim. You will have to farm EXP, kill a lot of mobs, get good gear and upgrade it, until you get stronger, in order to go into new areas of the map, search a lot online, you will probably need it, as zones have level caps, but this game wont tell you anything, literally, anything, but well... i guess that's the beauty of it.
[b]
Be patient, do not rush enemies, study their moves and patterns first, then take your move and kill them, dodge or parry exactly in the last second, remember, this is Elden Ring, exploration is key, if you cant beat an enemy, do not worry, come back later.
For 3 times i thought to myself, i m not ever playing this again, but i was wrong.[/b][h1]TRY. IT. best love-hate relationship there could ever be[/h1]
struggle

gud game, I like it. :>
Amazing game, incredible lore, awesome voice acting, amazing power system.
this game is OLD and sucks BALLS
First time I played this games I was very under leveled for Margit and got killed 40+ times like the biggest noob, leveled up and cranked through the game. 

Forward many moons later and the DLC was announced so decided to replay the game. This time Margit had a ass whooping coming and he definitely got it. That's my story :)
She Elden on my Ring 'till I bust
"Arise Ye Tarnished!"
good
Very easy, very relaxing game 10/10. highly recommend for casual players who want an easy challenge

üëç
I have 596 hrs on my PS5, but I decided to build a beast of a PC, so now I'm starting again on PC. Yep, I bought this game twice, that's how good it is.
liar ahead
Make sure to hit every wall in the game or you'll miss the best item.... trust me
Good game,1 hour in went in a cave opened a chest got fucking transported half way across the map died 3 or 4 times trynna find a way back to the church, died again saw a long hell way took it, fought a titan barely killed it, had to used some dirty tactics, and finally after a whole day in real life i was back at the church,def try it lol, also forgot to say i saw a castle went in died again so that's like 5 times keep in mind this is before i was back at the church.
An effort in excellence.
Simply stunning gameplay and storytelling and music and character depth and open realm.

the multiplayer is amazing, playing with friends is a really good experience, even getting invaded is fun. until dirk dingers beats you up in the liurnia rivers
pretty much best game ever. 10/10
O, Death. Become My Blade, Once More.
Elden Ring is truly beautiful. The game is worth the money and i absolutely recommend playing this game. I had 75+ hours on this game, while i had just started the game. In numbers i would rate this game 9.8/10. Just do more research before buying this type of games cuz it may be super hard for those players who get angry when they die. SO its definitely not for impatient Players.
Can't have sex with Morgott, bad game!
it won game of the year
I alone am tarnished

Super good game.

greatest game ever
Big sword goes bonk
WOOOOW, SO BIG, AND LARGE, AND GOOD, ITS SO GOOD, AND BIG, MAKES ME WANT TO COME AND PLAY, SO FUN, FUCK, SO FUCKING GOOD, OOOOOOOOOH FUCK YEAH, ITS SO BIG AND NICE, you know what i mean?

 Open world dark souls. Exploring worlds. It's great.
Greatest game ever made. This not some procedurally generated world that many game studios have lately started to embrace this new AI hype bandwagon. This game is a carefully hand-crafted piece of art. But, I'll say this, YOU'LL ONLY GET TO EXPERIENCE THIS GREAT JOURNEY ONCE. So, take your time to thoroughly explore the world yourself first and then rely on online guides or walkthroughs, because the satisfaction of having to discover something is beyond putting it into words. Have fun and MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD.
This was my first souls-like game. After 90 minutes, I contemplated requesting a refund because the combat was too difficult and I did not understand where I was supposed to go. Now I am giving this game a thumbs up because I played 176 hours after contemplating a return.
A wonderful game with a steep learning curve. If you're a seasoned souls player you'll be fine and enjoy the wide variety of gameplay options and vast open world. Jolly Cooperation always better.
Good game
its a fun game

Too much Ring, not enough Elden.
gg
So many good reviews, yet it is just... totally boring? Lifeless world, non engaging story. I wasted money here - dropped after two hours.
This game is good fun. The fights can be challenging but they feel really good and it's great when you finally beat that tough boss. The scale and design of the world and it's characters is amazing. I thought the verticality of everything to be particularly stunning. It's nice to explore too, and there is usually at least something to reward you for exploring off the beaten path. Good variety in play-styles and enemies as well. Only critique is I wish quests were a little more clear.
9/10
grant me revenge!
and if you do not listen
then to hell with you!
Overall this is a really fun game that I think people should try at least once. The combat both in and out of boss fights is engaging and rewarding and you get a true sense of accomplishment for every victory you take. The only thing that I wasn't too much of a fan of is how disjointed and awkward some of the npc quests are. Often times they change locations (sometimes as far as the opposite side of the map) without so much as a clue as to where they might be going, making it so that its very easy to miss, sequence break or outright ruin entire quest-lines. However, this gripe is minor compared to everything else I loved about the game. Overall I'd give this title a 9/10 and i'm very excited to see where the dlc takes the series next.

My introduction to fromsoft. I've never found myself so committed to a video game. I played hours on end and in fact I am still doing it after 150 hours because there is still so much left to cover in the game. If you are stuck on a boss (will happen a lot), you have the ability to leave and come back twice as strong as before. There are so many sidequests, questlines for different endings, weapons, spells, and so much content. If you love exploring and enjoying a good challenge, please play.
epic. 11\10
This game is good
I DID IT, I BECAME THE ELDEN LORD 
(A good game and I don't think its AS hard as people make it out to be. There's tons of guides on how to make the game easier, and how to cheese the bosses. If you struggle with these kinds of games and are hesitant because it's hard, just know that there is a way to make it easier for you and it is possible :) )
orgasmic
epic
good game
This game is like using a cactus as a dildo. Would highly recommend!
Not that "Hard" Not that "Easy" But this game so froking FUN!
oooooooooh, ELDEN RING!
swagalicious
this game has taken me trough some of hte hardest parts of my life , these parts where the game itself ofcourse , i beat rhadan first try though , yall suck <3 

the story , lore and concepts of some of the areas in the game are beautiful, the way the challenge is placed before you and how you push trough is just some of the most rewarding gameplay ive ever had
If love could be described in any way it would be this game, heart emoji
Damn this shiz a masterpizza
i love playing this game in my little goon cave.
Great 9/10
.
this game makes me gooey
Stunning game. 

Got it on launch, I've played nearly 1,500 hours. That means I like it.
A sandwich filling of death, pain and killing, wrapped in a dual layer of frustration and triumph.
I LOVE THIS GAME. MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD
Perfection, open world at its finest


ranni boobies
i git gud!
Since nobody will see this,
i'm gay and like my ass getting destroyed
Could this be the greatest game to ever exist? It easily could be. From amazing level design to outstanding and breathtaking landscapes, this game offers anything and everything you wish for in a open-world game. On top of all that it drops you into an intriguing lore-filled story that offers hours of mystery and world-building. The side-quests add even more hours of depth to a game already so rich with narrative. I cannot recommend it enough.
Started playing this after watching a lot of Elden Ring content but never picked up a Souls game before. Looks and plays amazing! I recommend using guides and a quest tracker!
Amazing game, 10/10 and im not even finished yet. 

There are slight issues, First of all, knowing the next place you are supposed to go for the main story is quite difficult, most of my time is spent running around trying to figure out where im supposed to be. I guess this is intentional? its kind of fun to explore and find side quests. 

The main quests are sooo much fun tho, the main bosses in this game are truly incredible... 

The combat is so much fun really. but the most stand out thing about this game is the incredible game design visually (genius art styles). The atmosphere and legendary boss battles are sooooo stunning. 

This game punches so far beyond any game ive seen. Its in a whole class of its own really. 

I think im CPU limited on a ryzen 5600 at 4k so im probably not getting full 120 fps, but its worth it for better visuals. It also stutters a bit, again I think thats cuz my cpu is a bit slow for this massive game. 

I cant wait to finish it and play the DLC later this year!
11/10

perfect in every conceivable way
Good
Cool game.
It took me about 100 hours just to beat the game once. I haven't even fought all the bosses, completed all of the quests or collected every weapon and spell. I would 100% say this game is worth the 60 bucks just from the gameplay alone. 10/10 goty
best
Best game i've ever played in my life
Good game. Worth the money.
very easy game very fun defo for people who are just getting into gaming :) is joke
If only I had pickle.
every time you play your one time playing elden ring closer to the dlc

Fun
I feel pain in every part of my body, a bird dropped a bomb in my soup then laughed at me and my teddy bear was stolen by a gremlin
masochistic tendencies fulfilled

good game
yes
[h1]It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.[/h1]

One of the greatest games ever released this generation, even for someone like me who typically don't play Souls-type games. The staggering amount of content, the sense of scale, and the world design/world-building, gives the player a sense of exploration unlike any other game. The art style, enemy variety, boss design are incredible, and the soundtracks are amazing.

The combat and build variety are great, and the bosses are some of the hardest in the series to solo unless using an OP build or by cheesing (looking at you, Malenia), but you never feel frustrated, and instead try to get better. However, game balancing is an issue. Some of the enemies deal absurd damage for how common they are.

The game is designed in a way that the player can make the game as difficult as he wants or as easy he wants, using the summons and tools given, making this game very accessible to any new players to Soulslike games.

If you're wondering about the hype and whether it truly is a great game, let me tell you as a newcomer to Soulslikes in general, yes, this game is a must-play and I'm so glad I've experienced it. 9/10
Whatever thou art, stay away. 
Soon, I will be consumed. 
By "Them", by the Dark. 
Ugh 
Ugh. 
 UAAAGH 
 Thou are strong, human 
Surely thine kind are more than pure dark 
 I beg of thee, the spread of the abyss, must be stopped. 
 Cough 
Ah, Sif, there you are cough All of you, forgive me 
 For I have availed youÔªø nothing 
End. HURR UAGHH DUURR DOOORP HUAAAAGHH
good
NOW I'M READY FOR THE DLC
This game makes me hate my life and is a good change of pace from League Of Legends. 10/10 would hate again.
seek, rump
yes
Mid.
The combat and enemies are fun and engaging. There are multiple builds you can do to fulfill a type of class fantasy. There is a large world to explore.
best game
get gud
I'm addicted help me
game is beyond amazing. you will always have somethings to do in this game. 10 out of 10
:)
One of the best games i have ever played. amazing boss fights and an awesome world to explore.
It is a Masterpiece 10/10
worth it
A bit like the board game Mage Knight.
gog
I'm normally a person that doesn't go far outside my usual bubble of media I consume, but hearing how great this game was and the praise it's gotten from some of my best friends, I figured I'd finally give it a try. 100+ hours later and I've gotten every achievement and it was an absolute blast! Easily one of the best games I've ever played, highly recommend it!
a really great game
The buffet of souls games
200+ hours in and I still haven't beat the game. 9/10 T-T
be wary of dog
even if your bad like me its fun
best ever
Before playing the Elden Ring, I had full head of hair, a healthy sleeping schedule and a lifestyle and a sense of personal accomplishment. After many nights filled with my own screams echoing throught my home, all of those things have vanished.....I have been kicked out of the house, in the very dark place of my heart full of depression and anxiety and my ADHD has been kicking in non-stop ever since playing the game. I am slowly getting my life back together, once i start living a normal life again me and this game shall meet again!

Other then that its a really good game!
this is one of those 'just one more game' games
hard to play easy to enjoy
game good. me bad. enough said
Best game
Kinda mid tbh, was only the greatest game I have probably ever played
mm
morning star >
good game for starters. If too hard just summon or go mage. If too easy go strength build with guts sword. Overall, let chaos take the world.
Elden Ring is one of my favorite games of all time. originally I was skeptical on weather I would enjoy Elden Ring or not simply because I had never played a souls game before and they have a certain reputation of being difficult games so I waited a year before I ended up saying to myself "ehhh it looks cool and it's on sale so why not?". However I ended up enjoying this game way more than I thought and for anyone who is skeptical because it's a souls game then I would suggest buying Elden Ring because 1: it is the easiest souls game because of the open world and 2nd: There are multiple difficulty sliders such as: Leveling Vigor, Using Magic, Using Summons, and Farming Souls. So with that said my favorite parts of Elden Ring are as follows: The rich, vast open world that feels amazing to explore, The insane amount of weapons, armor, and spells included to make it easy to create many cool builds, and the weird part for me is I never beat the game or even went to the Mountaintops of the Giants because for some reason I had so much fun doing Limgrave over and over again 40-70 times. 11/10. GOTY 2022 for good reason. deserves 1000 hours.
Boiled crabs

It's elden ring.
meow meow me me owmeowwwwwww meow! meow?

It's elden ring, what else do you want me to say?
vgood game

Excellent example of the 'Souls Like' genre. Many games since have been compared directly to this well made, extremely hard game! What the UI lacks in information overload (Ubisoft gamers need not apply). This is the ONLY 'souls like' I've EVER played and can't wait to beat it!! That reminds me....I've but over 200 hours into this game and still haven't beaten it 1 time yet. THAT'S how much content is in it! Well worth the purchase price, imo!!!
genuinely good game, have to recommend it to others to try, not my style tho.
Out of the 420 hours i have played, I absolutely love this game. it is very engaging and boss fights are hard and make you think. My favourite boss is Rykard. But in my opinion the best boss that I have fought was Horah Loux/Godfrey as I had the most fun strategising and figuring out his moves exc. 
Elden Ring has become my all time favourite game. 10000000000000/10
Tip: Dodge is your best friend ;D
peak
This game made me hate myself. I LOVE IT.
You can pick up this sword and than hit people with the sword and then the people die and drop a sword which you can pick up.
yes

gives me suicidal thoughts every time i try to do a boss
Add Sex
izza old ring
cool game
if you die you have to wait until the loading done and then walk 100 miles and die and repeat but its ok
I am a huge fan of souls games, but this game is different in its own ways. I really enjoyed the scenery in this game, it is very beautiful and very detailed. I usually don't like open world maps in games but I think the creators did really good when they made this game. I highly recommend this game.
I love this game. So much so that when I die because I got stuck on a rock, or because a random enemy didn't de-aggro and shot an arrow across the map with deadly precision, I blame myself for not being good enough.
easier then darksouls

dis game b gud n sheat
its fun when you finally beat the game over and over again and using different builds
good
Unbound open world prioritizing exploration but the devs can't design quests for shit, enemies are spammy {kindred of rot). Will end up needing a guide because they can't seem to write or hint at anything. Missing basic settings and controls on PC feel unpolished.
love this gAmes
Not my cup of tea, I preferred other FromSoftware games by far, but it is objectively a good game, so yea, buy it, it's worth the struggle.
Best game I have ever played.
ya
yes
millions of poor defenseless albinaurics i killed haunts me in my dreams but other than that its a good game
Bro this game done gave me

Dark Souls Open World
This is the best game i have ever played and i still haven't beat it... Try finger, but hole.
I've spent about 2 hours ingame before I even figured what I was supposed to do.
Then I spent another 4 hours at one of the very first waypoints to level and push my equipment.
I died numerous times doing so.
11/10 would die again!
Very nice!
Try Skill, become Elden Lord.
maldito pedazo de mierda de juego por dios que asco
Is good
Im not into soul games, I started back then with sekiro and got beaten up later I started with eldenring and I must say I fricking love this game. The story is so good, the designs of the whole world is just awesome and im hyped about the DLC coming this summer! Would recommend it everytime, oh and PRAISE THE SUN!

''You Died''
best open world game i ever played

I already have too many hours on the Xbox version. I will now dump countless hours into this one for the DLC. Be careful because you will lose yourself in the lands between. The days start to blur together and pass by in a moment. I must become the Elden Lord. Ranni is calling me.....
I can beacome Guts. Best game
Pain
I was defeated by this game. Steam issued me a refund out of sadness. 10/10 would lose again
try finger but whole

Yes
Beautiful
Gud gam
It is a fun game with a lot of things to do and open worlded
good game yes play
yeah
rot
It gud
Dog pope! üê¢

It's fantastic. Even for people unfamiliar with FromSoft's other games, this game is accessible in spite of its lineage of difficulty. There are multiple things you can do to gain strength, and also multiple strategies you can employ within combat itself.

The addition of the open world and crafting system is a huge boon to the formula. The open world encourages exploration, which has always been a strong point in FromSoft games, and also opens up tons of opportunities to power up through side activities and explore quests through the various characters you can find and talk to. The crafting system also functions as a way to ease exploration by creating useful tools, as well as make combat more manageable through crafting throwables, ammo, status inflicting items and buffs.

The moment to moment gameplay is vastly improved as well. You still have your light and heavy attacks, your guarding and parrying, and your magical spells in two different flavors. But all of these features have improved in a number of ways, including new ways to interact in combat. Combat Arts can be a fundamental part of the way you play, opening up lots of new moves and abilities, the new guard counter allows for a much more defensive playstyle to punish opponents after they attack, and heavy (especially charged heavy) attacks can break your opponents stance to open them up to critical hits. If you're struggling with a fight, changing your strategy can be a viable option, and if that fails then opening up the crafting menu can also give you the edge you need. If all else fails, you can rely on your fellow Tarnished and summon a friend (or stranger) to help you out in multiplayer.

This game is the best version released of FromSoft's formula that they've been refining for years. As someone who's played every game in the Souls series, including Bloodborne and Sekiro, this one is my favorite. And here's to hoping the DLC improves on this already great game even more!
Is good.
get cloud services this is ass
if you hate yourself play this game
tarnishes my reputation with women
69 lol
FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE 

THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME
peak
One of the most addictive games i have ever played.
Recommend if you wanna go insane.
This is the best game ever i literally cum to the thought of it
From a person who never really took interest in fromsoftwares games this game is a masterpiece to experience. Many games are, but for me at least Elden Ring has an allure that is unique.
First hug I got from a women.
I have ordered 20 replacement monitors and keyboards
elden hole
Switched from ps5 to PC for the DLC. 

Internet Connection is so bad for the PC Version. Its so worse compared to the PS5 netcode.

Wonderful game but this is a joke. i would like to get my money back ;_;
Great game
Best game ever
Phenomenal game
extremely mid game
(This is the most wondrous thing to ev'r existeth)
I like that you have to pay attention to attacks of enemies and running headlong into a fight is not always the best way to defeat enemies.  Also, the variation of styles of your character allows for replay ability with varying outcomes of quests.  One real negative thing I have to say is dialogue and story is sometimes tedious.
Its for sure the best game ever made,
And im super excited for the DLC

PS:
Dont use magic or mimic, or you're Weird
BEST GAME
This game needs a shrine of amana area and 3 king size beds of chaos in it to be good tbh
The only FromSoft game that I went for 100% on. Absolute banger
BEST GAME I PLAYED TBH
Remember a time when you're dad would come home after a long day at work?
He would walk in all tired, have a shower maybe sit infront of the TV and watch a WWE, and both of you would have a blast watching Rey Mysterio 619 the Big Show. All was right in the world.
But sometimes father, he'd have a few beers, and maybe he'd get a little mad at mum for cooking Meatloaf (Again) and you'd sit all quiet while he yells at her, and she hits him and then he looks at you, with that same look he just had for your mother. He grabs you by the arm and punches you in your 8 year old mouth. You sit there stunned, helpless because father always hits you when he and mother yell at each other.
Years this goes on until one day you've had enough. You move out of home and go out into the world keen to never look back on these dark times again. Not long after, you've started a family of your own, and you've vowed to never be like your father, you'd always treat your child better then he ever did.
Until one day, a messages comes by, "Hi son. I was hoping we could catch up? Maybe go see a movie sometime?" Your eyes tear up, he's trying to get into your life again, to do better. "Yeah dad, I'd love that".
You arrive at the cinema together, you've hugged made up, times are great again. 

That's this game.
Is gud gaem :)
Just a masterpiece

Everything is fine, except for the lazy attitude of the developers towards PvP, fixing exploits, lags due to easy anti-heat, which does not help, missing clicks (i.e. situations from the category: ‚ÄúBut I clicked!‚Äù is a given here.), and so lags of keystrokes, when actions do not occur by pressing or releasing keys, but with a delay.
1/3 of the invasions end before they begin, because the player entered the bossroom while you were loading to him or because you are spawned not closer to the player, but on a ‚Äúconvenient slope nearby‚Äù, from where you can clearly see through binoculars (and more often, even not visible) as your goal runs beautifully in the rays of the setting sun, unattainable for you.
the other third ends when you are connected to an open field, where 3 ‚Äúgood soldiers‚Äù shoot you with 3-6 guns.
In total, the last third remains, of this third only a third is not overshadowed by the reasons described in the first sentence.
There is something in this game, but the mediocre attitude towards the PvP interaction part (which is the MAIN one in the Souls series) negates many of the successes. As a final example, you will come to the realization that there is no meaningful in-game reward for a character for PVP (or even PvE).

The Game is mediocre at best. While the story and the content are marvelous, the design, music and scenery is some to really behold. IT all falls apart in the gameplay mechanic. 
Early game you have to really grind to get somewhere and progress and rewarding is measured with a strict hand. You better stick 1 specific weapon and sink all the upgrades in it or the bosses will become even more grinding than they are at some point. 
Midgame the pace picks up and until you get to the endgame content, you can fare pretty good and the rewards upscale a lot. This is the part where most fun is to be had.
Endgame content is typical, every enemy is overscaled, overpoised, overboosted in every way. In some cases some simple regular enemies have more hitpoints than some midgame bosses. Technically your HP is irrelevant as you are 1-3 hits, depending on your vitality. In some cases, some simpel field mobs are pvp worthy, the invader NPC-s have nothing compared to them. Even bosses can be hardly compared to some. Also, mediocre weapons are hidden in endgame which would be useful in earlier stages, grabbing them simply adds nothing to the gameplay.
In many cases the best tactic to use: dash from 1 SG to another, you have your progress saved. Farming is done via boss assisting, item acquisition can be postponed. You won't use most of them anyway in bossfights. 
Also when a game has pixelperfect platforming integrated instantly looses 3 points in my eyes.
All in all not a bad game but the endgame technically kills the part to which try to aim.

Good very good but angry? Perchance.

In the Top 5 best games of all time. Just play it if you haven't already.
Excelent game, at fist I was confused because was not used to this type of games (souls) a friend kind of point me in the right way, and when in the right path I enjoyed very much. Excellent lore and background histories on top of very good maps and true open map.
absolutely a masterpiece, worth every penny, give it a shot and don't give up right away, it's not a game to tread lightly
makes wanna kms but makes me cream when i beat boss
Love it
yes
good game indeed
JUST AMAZING !!!
tarnished ahead
Great Souls Game. Very Friendly to people to havent tried a souls game before
This game is a masterpiece, I don't like to glaze too much, but this game just deserves it. this game is huge and you will have lots to do, the enemies are challenging so you won't speed through the game too quickly, the story is very in depth and interesting, the game has lots of customisation so you can enjoy a build that works for you. The open world format for this game helps because if you are struggling with a boss, you can go somewhere else and get stronger, now the boss will be less difficult. only thing i don't like is the multiplayer, it kind of sucks, but there are mods that fix that. 10/10
This my most favourite game ever and i REALLYYYYYYYYYYYY love it and i suffered alot tryuing to vbraet malenia but i did it!!! persistabnce. this is a game opf persistance. Love this game|!! cant wait for the dlc <3

On multiple occasions when I was going in for an attack, a tutorial would pop up at the worst time.  I'm jumping and trying to press shift and left click for a power attack and a tutorial pops up while I'm midair and causes me to miss my attack and die.  wtaf

Great game for breaking controllers..
im not gay but i like when they beat my ass
peak
Put 130 hours in and didn't even beat it.
This game offers so much in terms of world, items, bosses, side-content, interconnected story-lines, etc, that even players seasoned to this type of game can still get bogged down.
That being said, I had to come back to prepare for the DLC in June.

ELDEN RING's take on an open-world was very well-executed, dense with points of interest, and varied in terms of environment and enemy type. Even though not perfect when compared to other FROMSOFT games, mainly in its tendency to reuse bosses somewhat heavy-handedly, the sense of exploration and achievement you can get from this title is amazing

9/10
[Waiting to see how DLC affects game at large]
First ever experience with a souls-like game and it has been fantastic so far.
Do you enjoy dying over and over again? Hopefully the answer is yes, because it will happen in this game.  Ride a magical horse finding magical weapons all the time and fight and kill enemies.  It is a fun souls game.
I hate this game. 10/10
fun
ranni
523 hours in... I have a problem. Or the game is just good
I don't play souls games usually. But I got this game as gift from my friend to try it out and I totally like and am addicted to it.
I would smash Radahn
Elden Ring was my first souls game and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The style of gameplay was new to me because I've known nothing besides first person shooter games; nonetheless I was able to adjust fast. If you're looking for something new, fun, rewarding, and intense I suggest this game highly. Not only is the game amazing in terms of graphics, but it prevails in other areas where developers seem to be struggling right now as of 2024. For instance: Story/lore, gameplay mechanics, level design, voice acting, in-game rewards, no micro transactions, helpful/funny/dedicated community, graphics again, creativity, etc. I can go on and on about how great Elden Ring is but this is actually that one game where you must play it for yourself to find out. If you get stuck there's plenty of guides and videos online to help you. This is one investment you will not regret. Have fun Tarnished!
very good game but has some moments when i'm ripping my hair out
very fun game, will piss you off while playing but great storyline and good boss fights
Best game
really fun game can be a chill experience if you would like it to be one, take your time and treat every encounter like it may kill you and you'll be fine for the most part.
game is long while staying fun and intresting making for a game you wont beat in an hour or two in other words if you purchase this game you wont need any other games for a while. definately worth the money
yes,
game so good you start seeing/looking for it in other game

Can't defeat the bosses? Git gud
I get it, another Elden Ring review that is negative that is unfounded but just giving my feedback.
 
The mandatory, I have played Demon Souls, all of the Dark Souls games, Sekiro  Armored Core 6 (I know its not Souls but its awesome!).

I like the tighter experience of previous titles, smaller, interconnected, filled with purpose. 
I felt Elden Ring was just a big world with dumb mobs placed every where, dungeons that felt so samey, reskinned bosses, and just crap tons of stuff to get into. For me it was a grind to just get through it. 

I guess I have gotten older and want to play whats fun not whats trendy, it just wasnt for me. I am not a combat efficientato by any means and the options, spells, ashes of war, summons were all good systems. At its core though, for ME, its just tiresome. Why or how can poison go through a wall? Why can a bad guy plunge his axe through rock and hit you on the other side? Why do bosses have unlimited stamina? Elden Ring had some of the most aggressive boss battles I have ever played through in a From Software game. Hands down. The last section of the game is littered with them back to back to back, its insane. Granted the open world gives opportunities to gain some flasks back but thats so you dont have to go back to a spot to heal again, it didnt make it more accepting in terms of difficulty. The dungeons generally are filled with the same wolves, pots, and gremlins, with a few traps and a boss or two at the end of it. Once you get the goodies in the dungeon or cave you usually find yourself dead at the bosses door or near death with no flasks forcing you to death with the boss so that you can just run all the way to the door again if there was no stake to bring you back to near the door. Fighting on the horse was fun although, the farther you get into the game, the more you realize the horse is just another piece of armor that most enemies are going to be able to kill. Its fast but they are faster. 

I think for people who love this genre and the Souls franchise this is a dream come true. Its a big expansive world with enough variety for people who want to see it, and lots of things to explore. More mini bosses, more dungeons, more exploration, more armor/weapons, summons, just more more more. But its also just more frustration, cheap boss battles and the ever present git gud mantra of some really just becomes icing on the cake, yeah, I dont need to do this anymore.
I love how creative you can get with all the different kinds of builds, makes for tons of replayability. Don't be afraid to run passed enemies or come back to fight a boss later. You'll likely need a guide for NPC storylines though, no shame in that. Music is peak.
Well, what can I say - This game is Masterpiece, 10 out of 10.
It took 300 hours for me to beat the game, with all side quests and exploring every corner of the map.
And guess what - I was never bored playing Elden Ring!
Waiting for DLC with great impatience
less gooooooooooooo
Best game ever with a tons of customization and content
my screen was so excited it started doing disco
gud
good
nice game
From software is my all time favorite developer
very hard to start with but keep at it and it becomes a brilliant game
Dog
Skummelt
good gaem

Thank You FromSoftware for making this game.
I good starter if you want to play dark souls 1 - 3, it's a challenge that allows you too explore and upgrade to beat whatever you want. If you explore enough, you can get an upgraded weapon strong enough for the final boss before you beat the first one
Hard!
[h1][i]I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.[/i][/h1]

I still hear these words in my nightmares...
Other than that, I'd recommend Elden Ring.

I'm really bad at souls-like games but still enjoy them. 
Can't dump 1000 hours into any of these games to "git gud", so I thought I would give Elden Ring a try. 
I've read that it's a bit more forgiving than Dark Souls or Bloodborne, still challenging but not in a "git gud"-kinda way.

These articles and comments were right.
While I still struggled at a few points, it never felt unfair and I was never "stuck" cause of Elden Ring's open world. Whenever a boss turned me into tomato paste 30 times in a row, I turned around and progressed on a different route. Fighting a different boss, defeating him, getting stronger and returning to the other boss again.

I really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the DLC.
Without the coop mod, I likely would have never tried this game. It ended up being literally the best gaming experience of my life. I will never forget this unbelievable adventure.

THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR PC
It's like they decided to punish the player if he plays with a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller
Or they just didn't care about the PC gamers
I'm not sure which is worse
disappointing
Probably the most fun I ever had in a video game. Exploration feels really fun and rewarding. Not just for the loot but the sight you get is a reward in itself. Combat is typical souls combat but with new skills and spells. The danger you feel while exploring the world really makes you feel like you are on a adventure which a game very rarely manages to get right in my opinion.

The things I dislike are rather minor like the copy pasted catacombs with copy/pasted enemies and interior. You may also get to other low level zones later which means you'll completely obliterate a boss, that could be fun to learn. The biggest problem I have with this game is the reuse of enemies and bosses. There are MANY unique enemies and bosses but some bosses appear like 6 times which takes some of the excitement away. Especially when a big story boss reappears as a random optional boss with a misspelled name.
waiting for the dlc

Truly an amazing experience that you'll remember for your entire gaming career

Definitely deserved game of the year.
"Emboldened by the flame of ambition"
wow... just wow. fun, hard, impossible, entertaining.. Elden Ring is my first souls and oh my goodness, it is a roller coaster of hatred and joy. Currently on NG+4 and I am still finding new stuff. So excited for the DLC....
fun

good
Wow amazing game a little late to the party becasue I just got a pc this holiday but this game is great, im only like 22 hours in and like 2 main bosses down and im still loving every second of this game! Im sure you all heard it by now but this game is a must buy 10/10 for me.
This game is incredible. Have played it from start to finish at least a dozen times now, including (1) play-through that is at NG+6. It's difficult, and certainly has a learning curve, being my first souls-type game, but it was probably the most rewarding game to complete I've ever played. Gladly will be paying for the DLC to extend this gameplay.

One warning, is that once you learn the combat system of this game, it will make all others feel stale, boring, or easy in comparison. That is the only down-side I had found, and I'm not entirely sure it's a bad thing to have high standards for gaming studios moving forward.
the world building is really interesting
If I wasn't on so many SSRIs, this game would have me at full mast. 5/10 for half mast.
good
the most frustrating piece of shit game i've ever had the displeasure of playing
the best game of the history, i love you miyazaki
Good
its ok
.
This game is absolute trash, I hate it. 10/10 would play NOT replay it, good first play through tho.
I strongly recommend this game, yes you are gonna get mad, yes you are gonna break your keyboard, and yes you are going to die, But there is a great story and the way that each decicion influences in the story is amazing
Best game of all time

Some of the coolest FROMSOFTWARE bosses yet.
if you dont play ur gay
eyy
Jman sucks at this game fr
mommy give hug :D
The most fun game i have ever played and will always be. This is the most recommended game I own.
A masterpiece, I have never played something so unique and visually gorgeous (lost all of my hair in the process and now im bald)

is good

Obviously nothing really needs to be said about this game what with it being so critically acclaimed and all. I loved it! The stealth mechanic that migrated over from Sekiro is a welcome addition. So many of the environments felt like call backs to previous soulsbourne games which I loved to see. There are so many different play styles available for someone since their are so many different weapons and spells. 10/10- would forget my entire playthrough and enjoy again!
this game is really fun
Praise the ring!
nice
Yes.
This game beats my ass more than my parents. 10/10
good game
Great game beat it on PS5 just replaying it on PC for the DLC
very good much wow
i got cooked on the second boss, im done with this game if you enjoy this game then you have a serious kink that you should talk about with someone
I would sell my left nut to play this game for the first time again
LILUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU is a nugger
Challenging but perfectly fair, the result of a studio taking every lesson learned and improving each time. Open world does a better job of easing you in to the difficulty than previous linear titles.
One of the best games I have played. I have over 100 hours on console and now enjoying the PC version
The accumulation of all From Software's best ideas and fantastic combat put into a huge open world with over 80 bosses. There's so many random encounters and dungeons to explore and endless weapons to try it feels like an adventure that never ends, every new location discovered better than the last. Not to mention the jaw dropping visuals with a level of detail that is a true feat for a game of this size.

Yeah it's pretty good
Hidetaki Miyazakis Masterpiece 10/10
its too hard ,only for die hards ,help vids useless had this  in many games you can do this  and that get great scores ,,,,no they are paid for giving  you  bullshit ,,leave this game alone
good game
I suppose one could say it's kinda neat.
IDK what I am doing with my life, help me.
My first ever souls born game and ive already beaten the game twice within a week. This is probably the most indepth masterpiece ive ever played, it makes perfect sense this won GOTY
good stuff
try fingers,
but hole
masterpiece
Very rarely do I wish that a game never ended, but this one felt like a magnificent dream that looked to have no end in sight. When it finally did it was a bitter sweet moment. Every area is so detailed, so beautiful, so rich in character and atmosphere that its almost unreal. The combat is fluid, weapons/spells are all interesting and feel fresh whenever you use something new, build diversity is there. The enemies offer challenge level from easy to hard to b.s but that's all part of this mountain that you must climb, b.s and all. Some of the best designed bosses in all souls games including sekiro. Jumping is a simple yet refreshing game mechanic that makes the game play feel more free. The MUSIC needs to praise because it goes without saying. 10/10
starts of pretty slow then gets fun then gets slow but then fun
I'm bad.
Best game I've played so far.
BEST GAME EVER LIKE NOT FKG WITH u
after finishing this game i can confirm it turned me into a simp üòîüòîüòî
I can't decide how I feel about an open world Souls game but I have played enough of it that I guess it must be really good
Getting slapped around by Gold Horseman

10/10 fantastic game
Just yes
good
This is definitely one of the best games ever produced, and clearly one of the bests from From Software. The graphics and quality are stunning, the fluidity is amazing and you will never get such an amazing open world for a Souls-like again. The fact that you have to puzzle the whole story together also makes it feel never ending. I feel like this is a generation's accumulation of gaming and Data all put together to create one huge masterpiece. I cannot wait for "Shadows of the Erdtree" and am getting sooo impatient about it. Would recommend to anyone trying to get into Souls-like games.
Elden Souls
I am a Demon's Souls hipster, and played it before Soulslike was a buzzword. It feels like Elden Ring is what FromSoftware was working towards all of these years. It is an amazing game.
One of if not THE best single players of all time.

Second Best souls-like game Ever. very fun huge and now were getting even more DLC Had to buy it on PC as well since i had it on xbox and played over 1000 hours there too.

arguably the best game I've ever played.

Very good game, just incredibly overratedüòÇ everyone praises this game like it‚Äôs the best game ever made EVER but in reality it‚Äôs a super fun and challenging game about killing kickass monsters. It‚Äôs just like darksouls where it doesn‚Äôt tell a story, but has a lot of history told through set pieces, so this game is great to watch a video and just grind out bosses in an open world.
this game is gonna put me in anger management classes, so you should 10000% buy 10 copies.
very good if high mental capacity

why is it always strong foe?
Good Game not for the weak of mind tho

Best game
After playing Dark souls 3 (first souls game which i actually really liked) decided to start this.. Again!, I had played this for a bit a long time ago but didn't really get invested no idea why lost interest i suppose *shrug*

Decided to come back make a brand new character and am currently really enjoying this game now, Love the open world and am a lot more patient with things then i first was, The open world is amazing so much to see and do! Loving this! Would recommend to anyone even if your new to the souls genre! :)

Good Game no Xbox controller support native

One of the best games to exist! In the Top 3 Games in my opinion with Red Dead 2.
Amazing game. Love it.
I accidentally got engaged to the ghost of a demigod piloting a 4-armed witch puppet; ended up going on a 1,000 year long journey through space with her in the end. 

10/10, would recommend.

Incredible game, an all time favorite! 300+ hours across 2 consoles and PC! Well worth the money!
its amazing the best game i have ever played i can recommend it enough
try fingers
but hole
Yes
i hate the scary space worm with the scary face.
Elden Ring made me stop playing halfway because towards the late game it was getting a little too brutal, BUT WE DONT BACK DOWN AND WE NEVER GIVE UP AND WE BEAT IT 2 MORE TIMES BECAUSE THIS IS GOTY. I always say the souls games get better the more you replay them. So if you read this, get a new character and your dragon smithing stones ready the the shadow of the erdtree.
I be Mohging all the way to the erdtree, first play through was a grim reaper black flame scythe build (made for a strength play-style but with a focus on dexterity). The frenzied flame incantations are the best edition to the souls magic system and was the core of my NG+ play through. Lazers shooting out your eyes and morgotts cursed sword were stat hungry tools but lvl 155 allowed for a hybrid build that leaves scorched earth in a wake. The 3rd play through I finally got around to using my favorite archetype of weapon, the colossal swords. Worked in most of them to deal with different areas and bosses but the real hero was actually working the grafted dragon first to the off hand to roll catch and get safe hits on bosses. The mimic tear spirit ashes is for noobs. So I used the Jellyfish and the stormhawk.  Intelligence and the way of fists are gonna be the next play through.
10/10 MY LORD
crazy and challenging ARPG
Maidenless wretch.
Dog ahead

It¬¥s fine feels like every other Soulslike but one of the better ones so 8/10
Game's pretty good
press B to roll or just parry :). jokes aside this game is fun as hell
good

How I love thee.
Best game, no equal.
I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat.
Fantastic entry by Fromsoft, I've never been let down so far and Elden Ring is truly a modern classic. I liked it so much I even bought a copy for my PC for the DLC in July. It can be extremely difficult but they have many ways to make a boss fight or situation easier. You are missing out on one of the greatest games of all time, just buy it and try it for an hour or so then get a refund if you dont like it (but you will).
I fooken luvs it mate

good.
big sword go bonk
good
Honestly one of the best games I've ever played. If you haven't played it yet, or are on the fence, buy it; this game is amazing.
I like every thing about this game 

The best from software game tilldate
lot of dog
As my first fromsoft game this game is amazing to me especially as my first real open world game.
Very challenging and lot of fun.
This is the first souls-like game I've played and it's absolutely fantastic, I have a lot more content to discover plus I've only done one ending now but I'm thinking of doing all the endings and discover much more of the world. 10/10 (one of the best games I've ever played)
amazing game
W game fr
Amazing!
I mean its fun ig
Its okay I guess
The perfect culmination of everything From Software has been working towards.
Uma obra prima 
O jogo n√£o levou o goty atoa, um mundo aberto extremamente vivo, com muitos objetivos para fazer itens para encontra, uma variedade enorme de armas e build para variar a gameplay, o combate do jogo √© maravilhoso, e n√£o tenho nem oque comentar sobre como a Lore desse jogo √© incr√≠vel e como todas as bossfight s√£o boas e √∫nicas, com efeitos sonoros e uma trilha sonora de bater Palmas de p√©, a batalha contra rykard e radaan s√£o um √≥timo exemplo disso, um jogo que dificilmente cair√° no esquecimento. E de todos os jogos que j√° joguei com certeza esse √© o com o melhor fator replay de todos, voc√™ quer muito jogar de novo e de novo. Recomendo para qualquer pessoa, e para quem nunca jogou souls like assim como eu, come√ße com esse jogo, voc√™ vai se encantar sem duvidas, uma obra prima e um dos melhores jogos que j√° joguei 
Nota 10/10 sem muito papo!

gud

Overall, probably the most approachable souls game. 9/10, would be a perfect 10 if I didn't have random stutters, freezes or crashes. Multiplayer is also quite jank, but that's just FromSoftware games in a nutshell.

You should fight Malenia.

Praise, weak foe! Therefore, try rolling!
Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild meets Dark Souls 3
A great game. Very good atmosphere & high difficulty. One of the best games in the last years.
i need a like,love you all
Took a while to actually get into it, but once I did I had an absolute blast
good
pling pling plong, but open world

DIS GAME GOOOD
why is everyone so attractive in this game its weird
Onion Ring
All I ever wanted to do was do right things 
I never wanted to be the king

Way too hard for no dang reason. No direction in the game, you just wander around with no instruction and no guidance. The controls are weird for some things. I followed a guide to get souped up early and still couldn't fight a little boss without getting one shot but I have to hit him 1,000 times to kill him. It's just not even a little bit enjoyable. There should be difficulty settings, it would be a much more enjoyable game for people like me if I could choose an easy difficulty. Not everyone wants to pay $60 to slam their head against the wall for hours haha
I wasn't sold too hard on playing this solo
The Multiplayer mod made me sold HARD!
Loving the game!
Best game of all time. It gets better the more you play it
Blessings of the Darkmoon
how have i not called this game good until now?
fin
Idk fun ig
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
This game makes me very depressed

top 5 video games ever made

w
goated
Yes!
yes
*beats the game* Returning to your world...
*DLC comes out* You are being summoned to another world...
hard and fun its like the first time you have sex she does some crazy shit you get scared and fight her off and when you beat that shit up you feel amazing at the end  enjoy
I haven't finish my playthrough yet, but this is easily one of the best games I have ever played hands down. Very highly recommend for anyone who likes large exploratory worlds and fighting unique and tough enemies.
- Absolutely god-tier artwork/art style/art direction and music
- Jaw-dropping landscapes and visuals inspire awe at every turn
- The combat is challenging and unforgiving, yet incredibly rewarding with plenty of ways to become overpowered and switch to 'easy mode'
- Extremely deep and fascinating lore (for those willing to explore it)
- A staggering amount of content - it just almost never stops giving
- Pay once and enjoy a full-fledged game and much more
- Very good replay value
- Absolutely worth much more than you pay for it
- 101/10 recommended
great game but i wish it had more hollow purples
Injected this game into my veins
me like
best game evah

easiest game to date recommended for beginners
overrated
Hi, please take my positive Review, thanks!

Second play-through in a couple months, when the new DLC is out. 
Being an Elden Ring fan is good eating.
as good as shrek 2

so good I bought it again on console
hit it till it dies
Its dark souls, but with walking to the store energy
No game will ever beat the experience of force spawning invaders into a ravine in limgrave while you're 100 ft above them and watching them run for 5 whole minutes just to reach you. all the while firing Renala's Full Moon at them like its some tower defense mode. literal 10/10 game and something i'll never see the like of again in my life time
Malenia mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmhmhhmhmhmhmh
Marika's Nintendog dies in the Cookie that Crumbles. That's canon, it's in the lore.
Simply masterpiece
This isn't Wizard101
amazing
no
Very Fire Game! Due To This Fact, It Won GOTY.
This game is in top 3 games I have bought in past 10 years. It was my first dark souls title and had a steep learning curve but was a great challenge and frustrating at times but also had great feeling of accomplishment. 
I look forward to playing the DLC soon.
I like the stabbing and rolling
Get a Honda Accord first 15mins and called maidenless. PERFECT GAME!

Turns out the Elden Ring was the friends we made along the way.
Game too hard!!!!

I am not very good, unlike the game
CUNNY! . . . mew~ >^ ,^<
ehh
great game, a bit difficult at first but once you get the hang of it no game can compare
Never played a souls-like game before and I have fallen in love with this game <3
good game
Endless fun and torment, but in a good way.
Great game. This brought me back into gaming.
sigma
a masterpiece

You will witness true horror... 100% the game, very neat, waiting for dlc

Esto cambio mi forma de ver un juego que presente un reto constante, que sea desafiante y tengas que cambiar de estrategias para vencer a un boss porque el spam no te va a ser de utilidad aunque hay sus excepciones
Amazing story! Perfect difficulty! Love it!

Fuck Godskin Duo

Foul tarnished, in search of the Elden Ring. Emboldened by the flame of ambition. Someone must extinguish thy flame.
Some of if not the most fun I ever had in a video game EVER sure it's hard as hell but it got me through tough times and a breakup so all and all amazing game 10/10 would recommend for anyone wanting a challenge in their skills
The GOAT

Not better than Fortnite
visions of no maidens
by far most sigma game ive ever edged to
likely sadness ahead
its good

[b]This game is a masterpiece.[/b] I know this review is incredibly late and we all know it won GotY, but seriously, I love this game with all my heart. The lore, gameplay, and design all come together to make a game that I seriously have to recommend. I truly could spend hours talking about this game but I'll try to keep it within reason (Though it'll still be a bit).

[b]Is this game for everyone?[/b] No. Combat is very punishing and balance can be a bit off for some boss fights. Sometimes fights leave you feeling like you were fighting the game itself rather than a boss, which can be very discouraging.

But if you think you can get past that, this game is a wonderful project that can make you feel like a god when you finally overcome the obstacles in your way. The story feels impactful the more you begin to piece it together and you should never find yourself feeling as if the world is empty, exploration is almost always rewarded, and even if not by items or story, it's by the messages left by other players. And as mentioned before, combat is so incredibly satisfying when overcome. All weapons feel fun and unique to handle and the variety of builds you can play with is amazing, and when you gain access to respecing, the opportunities for changing your strategies with bosses is second to none.

I truly could keep talking about this game, its impact on me as a person and truly just how fun it is to pick up and play. But I'll leave that for another platform. But take it from me, as I've spent 190 hours finding as many facets of this game as possible, please at least give it a go. It's so wonderful and I think anyone can find the enjoyment in it.

Also the DLC is right around the corner so no better time to play this game and prepare to take on the challenges in the Shadow of the Erdtree!
big sword  = fun
it's cool i guess
edlen wing
just get god of war Ragnarok

this was the wrong choice 2022...
this is my new favorite game.
If you ever wanted to feel the urge to  pound your balls flat with a wooden mallet this game is for you. Big thumbs up from me :)
i cum
yes
I won a mogging competition against Mohg
Top tier game.
wery good game
Really good game, I recomend it to anyone that like Dark Souls games
 Staff go pew
"May Chaos  take the world!!"

Elden ring is the best game of all time can't wait for the dlc to come out this summer!

epitome of an RPG game <o/
No one will read this review so I'll just say I'm heterosexual
goated game, 10/10 beautiful, may have punched my punching bag too many times but its alright
Dark souls in an open world setting. A game where there's weight to your attacks and movement. Navigation around terrain can be difficult, but there's plenty of help online.
can we remove flurry from malenia?
wicked sweet awesome game though
fun
this is the best game ive ever played, this is also the hardest game ive ever played
amazing

"I am malenia blade of miquella"
Good game

I love Elden Ring! But, I won't recommend it because of the forced black bars in ultrawide resolution. :-)

Game's really good. Only Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 are above it.

2/3 Mostly exploration

Amazing Combat and wonderful surroundings 10/10
GUD
Elden Ring is a triumphant masterpiece that seamlessly blends the best elements of open-world exploration and challenging Souls-like gameplay.
FromSoftware has crafted a breathtaking world filled with awe-inspiring landscapes, mysterious ruins, 
and The freedom to explore at your own pace.
discovery feel truly rewarding. Combat is fluid and intense, requiring skillful precision and strategic thinking to overcome the game's formidable enemies. With its gripping narrative, breathtaking visuals, and immersive gameplay, Elden Ring is truly a masterpiece,
 thank you FromSoftware <3
Amazing game!

Very nice
Great beautiful game. I love it and the multiplayer is a while lot better than earlier games but the mod seamless multiplayer makes it so much better
Not a single RPG will be able to top this game. Immersive exploration, challenging & satisfying gameplay, and phenomenal story-telling. Deserving of the Game of the Year award, and will still be my favorite game for more years to come.
I'm stuck in the first area
10/10
It is a very fun and challenging game, there are no quest logs so you have to figure things out on your own, def a Mature game for older teens and adults

Good game, go buy
Elden Ring has the worst combat system out of all of Myazaki's games. Most of the bosses are impossible to kill if you are by yourself or are not over-leveled for that encounter. The golden knights are impossible to fight on your own, especially the draconic variants, the main bosses are almost all horrible and frustrating to fight against unless you are some kind of demi-god or have memorized all the moves they do. The bosses have inhuman reactions, constantly spam 15 move combos, and spam a variety of distance attacks if you stay away from them. If you try to fight a draconic golden knight by yourself, you will be there for weeks if you want to do it all on your own with no summons and also without grinding and finding moonveil katanas. It would have been great if the combat was like Sekiro but better and the bosses were not so insane. It doesn't feel like a fight, it feels like you when you were a kid and you were defending yourself against daddy with the belt. Having to dodge 99% of the attacks and wait for a small opening to hit once and run away is not fun or intense, I learned nothing. Its just one big slog, one big mess where you push through everything in the most tiring and nerve-wracking way possible, in the end you have to resort to summoning bots in the fight. But you quickly find out the bots suck, so you go even further, just summoning other players to fight for you as you stay away mostly and hope that you are not the only one left in the end. And if you are, then you have very little chance because the end phases of the bosses will destroy you without you even getting near them, whether it is in the form of a fireball ·õãhitspam, or lighting strikes which you cant even dodge because they track your character's rolls. If you didn't have Estus to chuck every five seconds, you would be ·ö†ucked, in that case might as well summon a whole army of players, just make the game an open MMO. 
    By the way, most fights in this game are useless because the enemies just respawn after you kill them, whats the point of fighting them if not for drops or runes or whatever. You never have the satisfaction of clearing out an area of enemies, you just have to run past them over and over. The open world is empty, vast majority of items you pick up will be some sort of materials or some useless junk, you kill a massive knight in armor and you pick up a ·ö†ucking crusty mushroom off his body... You go off exploring an area you think contains something cool, only to find its empty or has a corpse/chest which has a "sliver of meat" on it. At the early game you are basically depressed because you can't find sensible equipment to use, you are forced to open the wiki online to manually look up where the hell the damn armor is located. Same thing with the quests, you have no idea which character goes where and what the quests are, you can even miss quests just by playing the game, so you have to look at the wiki. Not only is the armor hard to find, most of it is hideous, the designes are just fantasy garbage, more than half of it doesn't even make sense nor does it look good. Only a handful of the plate armors look somewhat historically inspired, the banished knight's armor looks the coolest but still has issues like the horn on the shoulder and the fuzzy hair on the back.

I give this a 5/10

EDIT: After finishing the game proper, I want to revise the final score to a 2/10 for the absolutely disgusting final bosses of this game, Fire Giant, Horah Loux, Radagon, Elden Beast, Malekith, Godskin duo. Those bosses are THE worst bosses I have ever had the displeasure of facing, alone they are unbeatable, you need to summon someone else to fight for you for all of them.
so good
Best game that humans will ever conceive of, my life will only be complete when I can transfer my consciousness into this game so my existence is one with it, the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the mods, all perfect. I use elden ring lore to teach myself how to study. Buy this game NOW

I pre-ordered the $100 Elden Ring bundle on Steam before it was released early in 2022 and remember that in the Steam store description it said that for pre-ordering the $100 edition. That I would get the digital artbook and soundtrack, a emote for use in-game as well as an expansion pass for future content. I assumed that the extra $40 when compared to the cheaper $60 edition of the Elden Ring pre-order available in the Steam store was for the mentioned future content. I have spent plenty on FromSoftware's amazing games and I am eager to play the new Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. However, I think that my extra $40 has gone to nothing when they decided to change how they planed on releasing new content for the game. I hope that isn't the case but would not be surprised if I don't get access to the dlc without forking over another $40 :( like wtf, in this economy LOL.
Swing big sword at big dragons and eldritch horrors.
the GOAT
amazing. period. really difficult, as is every souls and souls like, but either way, stunning to look at, stunning to play, stunning to die 40 times to a beginner boss. even for me, a casual player, this game is amazing and deserves all the praise it gets. definitely a worthy purchase.
Ride horse for 200 hours
she shattering on my eld until it ring
The elden ring is in the dark soul
The elden ring is in the dark soul
Made me become a  "FromSoftware" Dick Rider and gay for more souls like games, very very good. MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD

This game makes me so mad.

FromSoft forgot the fine art of distillation in this one.
"+dopest dope i ever smoked"
I like the cut-scenes, the weapons, the characters but ngl, kinda too ez
Amazing game, can't wait for the DLC!!!
This game is honestly such a masterpiece! I usually play multiplayer games that I can progress through or enjoy with friends and have found most single player games just not hit the same mark for fulfillment, but Elden ring absolutely hit the mark for me!! No friends and it‚Äôs still sooooo fun!! Have yet to try coop but I‚Äôm sure it will add even more fun to this masterpiece of a game!
elden ring
yes
Can't wait for the dlc
100%
before playing this game, i was maidenless. After playing this game, i am still maidenless
Bugaram meu save

good game indeed

Fromsoft's masterpiece.
margit can literally suck my elderberry and everyone in that dumb fucking castle but W game none the less
turtle=dog
186 hours in and on a second solo play-through (had a couple with friends) and I still feel like there are so many things I don't know about this game, how do I feel like a newbie after 186 hours
Souls are runes, bonfires are graces, but I still use dark souls words
i got to hold a girl's hand
why social life when the elden ring need shattering
So nice, I bought it twice! If you like Souls-like games, you'll like Elden Ring. There are additional features like spirit ashes that can make this game significantly easier than previous fromsoft titles, but they're optional so it allows for a good amount of difficulty scaling without having an actual option to change it.

If it's your first souls game, it will humble you. This game is tough but it's also very rewarding.
Online pvp on pc is a cesspit with chainsawers, cheaters and 350 ping lightrollers from the other side of the world who have never heard of an ethernet cable. Playstation is a lot better in this regard and has allowed me to actually enjoy the multiplayer. If you dont give a shit about the mp, the game is pretty good on pc, arguably a must play. I'd write a longer review about how good the boss design and combat flow is in this game, but theres lots of those already.
Please give us dlc now, Michael Zaki

good

Fia gives nice hugs :). Fun challenges, deep lore, and a lot of vindictive glee when you beat those ENRAG- ahem- *pesky* bosses
I DON'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEVER PLAYED ANY DARK SOULS (Styled) GAMES -EVER-!

(((I MUST NOTE BEFORE HAND: I am not dogging on the community or the game, it is a great game but it just too many flaws for a "normal games" Player and a huge waste of money. So don't take my post with hatred as i don't hate the game, just simply don't like it. )))

I was bored with every game I had. and I wanted to try something completely new. So I asked around probably 20~ people about a game that would last me hours, maybe even days to enjoy and about 60%~ recommended Elden ring. I told them "I've never played any Souls game in my life" and they all said "It doesn't matter since this is nothing like a Souls game" so I took their word for it as they also told me "it fun" "challenging" and "has a lot to offer", and ill state that they weren't wrong. but it isn't "Fun", it's more than "Challenging" and there is no damn story. I have given it 5 hours of playtime just to see if I can give it a chance and after 5 hours, I was just so damn bored. It's a time waste. and I would love for a refund back so I can use my money for a fun game...

CONS:
- Boring
- Tedious
- Time Wasting
- More than "Challenging" (if anything, EXTREMELY DIFFICULT)
- Can't stay alive for more than 10 Minutes
- Weak Weapons
- Too many LVL Ups needed to use a different weapon
- It's just Overall Boring and a time waste due to no Plot or Path to follow

PROS:
- Extremely Difficult
- Time Waster for those who have enough time to waste
- uhhhhhh.... Idk what else

Please, PLEASE! Dont rec this game to anyone who never played a Souls Game (Or anything familiar since this isn't a souls game) Since it is just too much and too little...
What more can be said about this mastapiece
Finger. But Hole
Probably the best game of the modern age. Buy it and play it.
Get used to hearing "I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella."
Truly, this is an elden ring
STUFPID GARGOYYAL TWINsSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Game constantly likes to remind you that you have no bi****s
What else can i say? Its elden ring, great environments and every fight turns to a dodge simulator until you can do whatever you want. Great replay value due to the new game+ and the game handles your high level exceptionally well.

Now a few words from our sponsors:
Put the foolish ambitions to rest.
Thy fate lieth under my moon.
A crown is warranted by strength.
My fellow, you've fought well until now.
Cower before Maliketh, the Black Blade.

Greatest souls game in the series these devs never disappoint.

very good game, had lots of dogs
yipee
The best game ever (300 h on PS4).
Open world is not my taste.

If you dont play this game you a bitch
Pros- I love this game

Cons- I hate this game
game good. game hard.
This game is amazinggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg....FOR YOU ARE MAIDENLESSS !
Why always dog?
pretty good idk
Best game ever. What else is there?
The artstyle is beautiful, the gameplay is pretty good and the lore is fantastic. I however hate the fact that the lore is presented through things like item descriptions. I only really came to understand and enjoy the lore after watching several hours of lore videos on youtube.
Fun game thats challenging
honestly kinda reminds me of dark souls,  pretty  cool
The only kind of games that encourages you to behave as maidenless menaces as a career invader to provide strife to other players. 10/10 would let my wife and kids leave me all over again to relive the first playthrough experience.
It has something to do with rings
fucking cool as fuck
This game is to ez
goddi good game!

fun
Try finger, but hole
i liked the game mechanics and how beautiful the graphics are in the game. The amount of different builds you can make that allow you to melt bosses but also still enjoy the challenge of trying not to die is incredible.
recommend cause it makes me want to break somthing 100 100

Maidenless irl, maidenless in game, no hope.

Elden Ring: A Masterpiece of Modern Art in Video Games

As a long-time fan of video games, I've experienced many adventures, but few have captivated me as deeply as Elden Ring. From the moment I started playing, I was drawn into the epic world that FromSoftware has crafted with this game.

The music of Elden Ring is nothing short of breathtaking. Every note, every chord contributes to amplifying the emotional depth of the game world. The compositions seamlessly adapt to the mood of the scenery, enhancing the gaming experience in a way that few games achieve.

The voice actors also do an outstanding job, breathing life into the characters and infusing their stories with authenticity and depth. Each voice adds to the atmosphere of the game, making it an immersive experience.

The atmosphere of Elden Ring is simply unparalleled. The dark yet captivating world is full of secrets and dangers. You can practically feel the story lurking in the abandoned ruins and majestic landscapes.

The character design is another highlight of the game. Every NPC, every enemy, and every boss is meticulously crafted with attention to detail. Their designs are not only visually impressive but also contribute to the storytelling of the world.

The various regions of Elden Ring are so diverse and well-designed that you never get bored exploring them. From gloomy swamps to majestic mountains, the game offers a wealth of landscapes to discover.

And of course, the story cannot go unmentioned. Elden Ring tells a profound and captivating tale full of intrigue, betrayal, and heroic deeds. Every detail of the world contributes to unfolding the story, and it's a true pleasure to uncover each mystery.

Overall, Elden Ring is undoubtedly a masterpiece of the modern art form of video games. From the music to the voice acting to the character design and the regions, everything is perfectly balanced, creating a gaming experience that will not be forgotten anytime soon. This game is an absolute must-play for any video game enthusiast.
I'm going to be honest I have enjoyed fromsoft's games since the release of dark souls, I remember being a young kid hyped up and ready for a grueling sadomasochistic enjoyment of a never onslaught of death.

With Elden Ring I've been disappointed.. the Bossfights and gameplay of half the game are copy pasted repeats of the content you first encounter in the game. With the speed and pace of boss battles being a frenzy of 5-7 hit combos, frequent unnatural delays meant to trip up a player, combine this with the half second input lag that frequently occurs on rolls, it's a recipe for disaster.

This game took away from the experience of intuition that most souls games forced you to adapt yourself to, and instead require rote memorization of a boss' 20-30 possible moves and attacks to carefully dodge often requiring you to die a multitude times more than predecessors of the genre.

Fights and combat are either overly difficult and needlessly long due to the abundance of flying and hyper-mobile enemies the size of 4 school busses, often needing to wait a full minute before you can get a single hit in. Or in the case of the elden beast, the final boss of the game running 10 football fields away requiring you to make a beeline 10-20 good times becoming an exhausting boring marathon of wacking a pinata with a stick on a treadmill. The late-game was a slew of lazy boss design and attack motions such as in the case of godfrey spamming a ground pound with the same animation 100 times in a row.

The dungeons of the game are a boring slog, copy pasted over and over again with the same layout and bricks that put Skyrim to shame, filled with the same enemies you've fought the past half dozen times.

While this is a good game, it's not the 10/10 GOTY everyone calls it, I'd dare anyone to venture beyond using mimic tear, spells, and rivers of blood to attempt a fight with a shortsword or club. Melee feels like crippling your knees with a bat before a 5k, whereas ranged builds are given an immense advantage that had not existed in prior iterations of the souls series. 

In essence I feel Fromsoft balanced their game around a multiplayer and coop experience which is even harder to find due to the endless amounts of cheats and mods, throughout the last 70 hours of playing I was never able to invade, find an invader, or even play a single match in the coliseum. Which makes me suspicious regarding the supposedly high player counts boasted of on steam.

The art style is excellent, the lore and various questlines are intriguing, but the gameplay of the game bounces back and forth from being either far too easy, or punishing the player for using anything slower than a katana in melee combat, and at times making it NIGH impossible to score hits on certain enemies such as the fallingstar beast.

I've never once wanted to speedrun a Dark Souls game, and with Elden Ring it couldn't be finished fast enough.
git gud
Why is the first boss harder than my penis?
Way too hard. Can't even get past this "Soldier of Godrick" guy.


(10/10)
best game ever
hhhhhh
I mean, it's alright
really good game

As usual from soft, great world building, great environment, great combat. Torrent sucks to ride, but awesome replayable game otherwise.
I like jars.
10/10 one of the best games ive ever played (still good)
bestttt
Awesome game, awesome story, easier than other fromsoft games, randomizer extends replayability by a LOT.
Hot garbage. Last boss is pure shit. Learn how to design games before releasing this atrocity.
I want sexual intercourse with the people who made game
After playing with Outward DE for about 2000 hours, I decided to give a chance to Elden Ring.  I was never attracted by Souls games while I found those very very veeeery  "mono directional" and Elden Ring being open world I decided to give it a chance. And while playing it my reactions was just : WOW !!! The story line, lore,  artistic direction, mechanics are just INSANELY beautiful and amazing, it s a pure jewel . 
Morrowind + Outward + Elden Ring are the Holy Trinity  !!!!
goat game
best game ever
100%ed it just by dying 512 times in a row and letting my girlfriend carry me through everything while i ran around barefoot in a deathbed dress (whole 0.6 phys dmg negation) <3

Good game
my mind hurts

A perfect game if you are maidenless
One of the greatest ever made!

It's amazing.
If I could kiss this game on the mouth, I would. 
That's is. That's the review.

Arise now ye tarnished, take the plunge and seal thy fate as Elden lord. Thous't shall set on a path full of strife yet thou shall emerge victorious.

Behold, dog.
Could it be dog?
Dog, oh dog.
Just not as good as DS3.
Music was a big disappointment, especially after the masterpiece that DS3 was. While I can remember every single track from DS3, I can only remember Radahn's and Radagon's themes but nothing else because it all felt dull and meaningless.
It's a nice time playing it once, but not the memorable journey Souls games traditionally offer.

Pretty good game

good game to spend a lot of time and not get bored. Just be prepped for a challange

decently easy, good for people that have just started playing video games
Ngol
After over 200 hr i finally defeated Soldier of GODrick i think i'm ready to fight the infamous Malenia Blade of Miquella but she does not stand a chance.
Video Game :)
Fantastic game. Such a rich and interesting open world full of mysteries to uncover and interwoven stories with well thought out characters and lore. 500+ hours and am still uncovering new things. Worth every penny!
good game but dark souls 3 better

Great game!
one of the best games ever
shit game
Very much pain but very much fun :D

Hands down, the best game ever made!
After MANY many hours and pain and deaths etc I have finally gotten all achievements in Elden Ring While i can say this reduced my mental sanity to live to about 0.01% i would do it all over again this game is sooo painful but so fun at the same time I wouldnt have it any other way
Absolute worth it.
very good game but needs bigger map in multiplayer

Shit ass Game
‚Ä¢ Dark Souls 3 combat pretty much. Enemies and bosses seem to be faster, while on your end everything feels slow and clunky. I am a little tired of this cadence, I want more Sekiro or Bloodborne combat. Still really good though.

‚Ä¢ The addition of a dedicated jump button is welcome. I'd be impressed if they added a climbing mechanic like the one in Sekiro.

‚Ä¢ Torrent is useless outside of the speed boost when exploring. If it dies from fall damage, you die as well. The double jump feature is obsolete outside of sequence breaking platforming as it doesn't negate fall damage, found that out the hard way.

‚Ä¢ Enemies are inconsequential for the most part, some exceptions that stand out REALLY stand out though, for better or worse. Revenants, Runebears, Lobsters, Birds and Hand Creepers all feel very fresh and unique in design but can feel kind of awful to fight. I still enjoy their designs very much however, they feel very fresh.

‚Ä¢ The majority of the main bosses are some of the best that From games have to offer. The gimmick bosses are From's best gimmick bosses to date as well. A personal disappointment was Godfrey, all that hype and marketing only for him to have a glorified Chained Ogre for a 2nd phase... Zangief looking ass.

‚Ä¢ As for minibosses, the sword and shield Crucible Knights, Erdtree Sentinels and the Bell Bearing Hunters are AMAZING minibosses, classic Fromsoft knight badassery. The Godskin bosses are pretty memorable as well. Every other miniboss felt either inconsequential or very unenjoyable to fight, like the Deathrite Birds and the Magma Wyrms.

‚Ä¢ In terms of content, the game is extremely front packed. When you finish Limgrave and one underground area, you've seen like 50% of the game, add Liurnia and Caelid, and you've pretty much seen about 95% of the content the game has to offer in terms of enemies, minibosses and items. That leaves you with 4 more main areas, 4 legacy dungeons and several underground areas and so many dungeons that are pretty much copy pasted content. I expected it following my experience with the CNT (Closed Network Test), but I can't pretend it didn't disappoint me when it turned out to be the case.

‚Ä¢ They marketed ER NPCs as having rich stories and their own agendas. They are literally the same 10 or so obtuse NPCs you can find in previous From games that wait for you in fuck knows where to chat so their quests can progress. Melina, the icon of "deep character" (during marketing), is absent for 99% of the game. She has like 7 completely optional and random interactions scattered throughout the world, throughout this 100-200h experience, that have literally nothing to do with her. Other levelup ladies and the Sculptor in Sekiro had WAY more character development. The game is consistent to older From games when it comes to NPCs; the issue here is, the scope of the game is like x10 of any of their previous games, so there's a clear mismatch. You get neither quantity nor enough quality to keep up with Elden Ring's huge scale.

‚Ä¢ The world is gorgeous and the level design is impeccable, always. The views are picturesque, the art direction is unreal.

‚Ä¢ Stability, Bugs, Multiplayer: the game ran terribly at launch and still has stutters in several areas after several patches, mostly due to EasyAntiCheat. Optimization was bad and has even gotten worse after the RTX update, I don't know what they messed up but the poor performance persists even if you turn it off for some reason... For good co-op/ multiplayer, use the Seamless Co-op mod - it does away with the archaic limitations and annoyances that From like to cripple their games with like disconnects, no summons unless the area boss is alive, invasions and whatnot.

‚Ä¢ As for the soundtrack, the main bosses have great themes. Some of the minibosses as well, especially Erdtree Sentinels. Unfortunately, despite Bandai Namco's and Sony's (false) advertisting, ER clearly doesn't use live orchestra. But lacking sound fidelity aside (cause they aren't live recordings), still a really strong soundtrack.

Conclusion: The game started as a 10/10 for me and then as I played more of it, the weak parts stood out more and more and it tumbled down to a solid 8.5 or maybe 9/10 if I really stretch it. As an overall package, it's definitely their most ambitious game to date. Bloodborne, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 however are kind of more consistent in quality, although significantly shorter experiences. Still, what ER does well, it does better than any of the previous games (mainly, the world and level design). Hopefully the DLC will bump the game up a couple digits for me, I can't wait for Messmer to impale me. Also I really, genuinely hope they move on from the slow Souls combat for their next game. Give us more Bloodborne or Sekiro combat speed and difficulty please, the Souls combat feels so overdone at this point...

Buy the game at full price if you can afford it, it is worth every penny and Fromsoft really do deserve the support.
awesome
After playing ER I do not believe the souls formula works in an open world environment. Everything about this game made me think "I liked how this was done better in Dark Souls or Sekiro". 
The world in ER is not coherent, it's just a map for a game to happen in, things are just scattered around to fill the world with content without much meaning behind it. 

In Dark Souls everything felt like it had a place, a story and a meaning for being there. The fact, that a lot of assets are re-used in ER from DS3 doesn't help either. 

In short, everything about this game pales in comparison to older titles in the series - world building, story, characters, enemies, bosses and level designs, music etc.  Bigger is not always better. A more linear, hand crafted experience where everything is meticulously designed therefore has a bigger impact in the game is a much better approach for souls like games imo.
best game ever

Ranni is one big bloodborne reference.
Yeah
New fortnite update go crazy

Good Game


i wanna bang marika
I usually stop playing games cause they are bad. I stopped playing elden ring cause i am bad
its aight
Elden Ring is FromSoftWare's attempt to keep the Soulsborne Formula the same but with minor additions that impact the game in amazing ways i.e jumping as an example. Now I enjoy this game and it's a well made game (Though not that well optimized I will admit) It's FromSoftWare's biggest game to date and the mass amount of people getting into FromSoftWare games just because of this game speaks volumes. Now I have been playing FromSoftWare games for a long time and as much as I like this game and all the praise it's getting is warranted I don't think Open World DS type games are personally my cup of tea. It's great they tried something different but for me it misses the mark by a hair, do I still recommend the game? Yes especially if you're new to FromSoftWare as a company as Elden Ring is the easiest of the FromSoftWare games so if you can beat this and get used to how it's played you will exceed and know how Miyazaki (The creator of this game and many others) brain works and outsmart his creativity but there is two games from FromSoftWare that you will fail no matter how much experience you will rack up from this game those being Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Armored Core these two play drastically different than most of their line up of games so don't play with a DS mindset is what I'm trying to get at.
M.I.L.F = Man I Love Fpoisonswamp
it`s a bit Tuff But Overall Fun and good gaem
game good
ok game, no slave knight gael. 6/10
is good
Started the game lost to tree sentinel like 20 times left came back 20lvls later won POG
Don't play this game if you don't like sadness and body horror. 10/10 would recommend, otherwise.
Pretty gud
DODGE
It's Elden Ring, wdym?
Pretty good
ez
 THE GAME IS FANTASTIC GO PLAY THIS GAME NOW THAT WHY HE IS GAME OF THE YEAR BUT GAME SHOULD BE EASIER GO PLAY THE GAME NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
The countless bugs, glitches and uncompleted or unrefined mechanics are so annoying to completely ruin the game experience, where the only undeniable good work is placed in the level design and artistic choices. Combat system is slow and boring and the controls (both mouse/keyboard and controller) are so stupidly chosen and implemented that they're verging on the absurd. After two years, Fromsoftware haven't fixed anything, stealing money from their customers.
Only thanks to the modding community, a small portion of those bugs have received a workaround, but too many are still present. Instead of enjoying a challenging combat, you end up trying to understand how to fight despite the bugs that limit your actions, or somethimes how to use them instead of fighting legit.
FromSoftware proved to not being able to even develop a game of a category they invented.
It's still good for masochist players that like to play bugs, not games.
Game category: Kusoge.
super awesome game but the side quests can get some improvements. for all side quests you will have to look up on the internet and thats not a good thing
i cant feel my fingers. ive never been more stressed in my life. the amount of hours i put in to this game is enough for the next seven generations to. i cant take it anymore.

Yeah its a pretty good game though
this game is clearly dark soul copy!!!11
Different strokes for diffierent folks.

Th eirony of you saying "grow up" is contrary to your lack of empathy for understanding that people like loads of different things. It isn't wrong.

Plenty of people love to collect achievements purely because it offers something EXTRA to normal gameplay. Somtimes they can be pretty neat, like in Half Life 2 giving you the idea to play the game with only 1 bullet.

So, sorry, but you expose your ignorance in saying this, I have to be frank.

And before you try tarring me with a brush - I can take or leave achievements.

But it's no different to someon not likeing or liking a certain genre of game, or like myself, not being able to play Dark Souls properly, so I cheat offline to experience all that I can. My game - my rules for enjoyment.

If you can't fathom this I don't know how you'll get through life.
Big hammer
nothing about this game is fun

This is a review from a non-soulslike player.

At first when this game was released i was on the negative side where i was like another dark souls, an annoying hard game that i don't want to try, amazed that it even won Game Of The Year. Talked with some of my friends how the game is all about a single community of soulslike had negative view points to be honest.

3 Months back one of my close friend(as he also not a soulslike player it was his first soulslike game and he's playing in coop) recommended me to play the elden ring, i was like no somehow he convinced me by showing some of lore of Malenia and Miquella and i loved the story so i thought of lets give it a try. Bought the game with dlc as my friend said get the dlc too so here we go.

so in my first play through i picked Vagabond class and i was playing with shield trying to parry and dying a lot my friend suggested leave the shield and just learn to dodge turn out this was much better for my playstyle. 1 week of playing the game understanding about stats/items/weapons/levelling/world/quest etc, i got hooked to the game. Killed the first boss after soo many tries. complained to one my friend who already finished elden ring he said "yes, the first boss is unfair for new players as the 2nd boss is much easier". Beat the second boss then after beating Rennala i changed my build and started using Sword of Night and Flame. Got to the best boss fight i ever had Radahn. soo many tries but in the end i won and from here i got deep into the lore Started watching VaatiVidya on YT for lore GOT HOOKED.

For a month had to leave home for work means no gaming for a month and i never felt like that i want to go back play the game and complete it. But somehow this game is truly different. Got back home started playing again changed my build again to Greatsword with all strength enjoyed a lot. At fire gaint got stuck so changed my build again to moonveil with Nagakiba. This new build was more fun for me as its more agile. Now i'm at final boss waiting for dlc to drop so i can once again enjoy this game. Achieved almost every achievement on steam only game ending achievement remains that will be done after dlc.

This game is new player friendly only if you give this a game time to understand its mechanics or else you'll refund it. The lore of this game is truly a masterpiece. Game design is on another level that cannot be achieved its just a miracle. On very few Bosses i felt like wtf is this boss but overall i loved playing against so many bosses. Maybe a those few bosses deserve a rework or to be looked at like (elden beast he is more annoying then Malenia). Music always hits the right spot at right time. Graphics is just wow as dunky says "Its like walking in a well made picture". This game is just a piece of art that you should give it a try. This game defines what a truly open world game means
I should've played this game when it was released.

This Is The Game Of The Century.
Best game I will ever play
Bussin my G

Became Elden Lord, now the bitches can‚Äôt get enough of me. RIP Melina, free my boy Hewg from the shackles of despair.

Very good game. Loved it. Played with friend and beat the game just under 40 hours. Some bosses are hard but you feel so accomplished if you beat them. Progression isnt hard to understand. Controls are simple. Very fun game and wont get bored anytime soon.

elden ring gets u maidens
This game makes every other game feel boring. I am an fps player and while this is my first souls game, it has become my favorite game of all.
yer
very good game.
great game buiteflu story
Love it and always will.
very fun :)
A work of art, purely art. A chef's kiss for any souls fan.
Its a must play game 10/10
Game will lag your system to the point where you can be a sliver away from killing a boss, oh look, your inputs for keyboard/mouse or controller went out for no reason at all. Every time I play this game, it stops, I hear windows go off in the background (no notification) the game lags out/freezes for a solid minute whilst I'm getting a smack down with no lube from Morgott of all people. Not even as a boss, this is so stupid. I beat the game with a friend and it was amazing, no idea why it has to be trash all of a sudden. Game was fine before, dunno what happened to make it a piece of garbage now. It bothers me how the game was fine not even two months ago and now it lags every single time I use it in offline and at the lowest of settings. I wanted to play five minutes without some BS happening and I can't even have that. Just. Wow.
when i kill a boss my pants get wet
peepeepoopoo
goated
is gud
Fun and challenging game like all souls games, just be sure to have your game's settings right or you'll suffer lags.
fun
Great chest not ahead..... Still good game though.

love everything about it the multiplayer, difficulty, and the open world aspect.

I would recommend.
Caveman TL;DR at bottom

This game makes me go sad. I am alone in the dark by saying how I don't enjoy it, because everybody and their second cousin (twice removed) has absolutely devoted their heart and soul into promoting just how good Elden Ring's supposed to be. I am not in the minority, no, I am practically alone when I dislike this game, but I think I have some good points that should be made.

Firstly, this game feels like it was made for console. I do not like console. I do not enjoy a controller. I do not want to sacrifice my pretty boy baby keyboard and mouse so I can actually get a feel for this game, because it is a game that actively supports keyboard and mouse as a platform. Think of it like this: you go to the store, and buy a Nintendo game which is promoted to be compatible on your playstation. Now, you don't like Nintendo. Maybe it's cause you're still tilted over the rage super smash bros has brought you over the years, but when you hear that one of their games, supposedly the best, is compatible on a different platform, you take the chance and get it. Then, when you download the game on your playstation, it's not very fun as opposed to when you once tried it on a Nintendo console, which it was explicitly designed for, and you don't have. Other people have agreed with this first point: it's dumb to allow keyboard and mouse if it isn't well polished enough to be enjoyable ON keyboard and mouse. I'm with the southside P.C gang for life, and I ain't gonna pay for a $60 controller, re-learn how to use it, and then only use it for one game. It's just like DLC you have to pay for in order to make the base game fun.

Which leads me to my second, and more controversial take: Elden Ring is not very fun on keyboard. I don't know exactly what it is, but for one, not being able to dodge bosses in an omnidirectional way like you can on console is a genuine cap to your skills based on how those bosses attack you, which limits the amount of freedom the player has. Hitting "Q" to immediately lock onto enemies takes about 90% of the fun of out of using a mouse, because moving your mouse mid-combat is as effective as blowing out a forest fire by farting. Of course you can move it around to look at the surroundings, but if you aren't using the auto-locking feature on enemies mid-battle you better hope to god that your character can precisely aim their flailing sword using good ol' 8-directional WASD. 

"But... what about teh controller PLUS P.C??" I hear some cry, dorito and cheeto dust in the midst of having a war on your unwashed T-shirt from high school. Fair point, but the only reason I bought Elden Ring was because of keyboard compatibility. If it weren't, it wouldn't even be in my Steam Library, because that's where it'll have to stay now that I've breached the 2 hour playtime cap for steam refunds. I really don't want to dislike this game. It looks so, so good, and the strange, yet creative landscape along with the difficult gameplay (which I don't really mind) makes it an objectively good experience, so it's a shame that it's an experience that I can't take a part in because of how Console-centered this game seems to be. And, hell, why is it MY fault that I bought it? If you make a game that's promoted as P.C compatible, but is very heavily reliant on controller as it seems to be, why wouldn't you at least say, "Hey, douche. You need a controller."?


Caveman TL;DR: Game good no keyboard. Game bad- me want keyboard.

Never could get into this game, giving it a downvote because I'm salty and not because the game is bad
Played this through three times on Playstation, now i had to buy for PC and go for the fourth before the DLC comes. 

My top three game of all time
rare game these days. only a few memorable games come out every 10 years.
√© o goty, nao tem jeito
good game
I personally think that this game is so well made I would recommend to other people to play it. There are so many places and varieties to play it is so fun.
pls add sex with gideon in the dlc fromsoft xx
It's aight.
I was not as awe struck as most were by this game. I know I am an outlier here, and I will not pretend otherwise.
I've played thru DS3 & Sekiro. Ive attempted DS1 and DS2 but could not do the dodgin' in 1 and 2 was just odd.
My current thoughts are - I love the world. I love the aesthetics. 
But when it comes to combat, thats my gripe with Elden Ring.
I dont like that the tracking is ramped so high for bosses, and obvious input reading as well. I don't mind one or the other. But its either you cheese it, or you drudge thru it.
My rating is very based on enjoyment of play. And when it comes down to it, I just didnt enjoy the last half of the bosses in ER cause of that stuff.
I'm going to go against the grain on this one and not recommend it.  I know it's widely hailed and all that jazz, but I just can't get behind this game.  Even though I don't care for "Souls-like" games where you constantly die, I still decided to give it a try based on its glowing reputation.  Thinking that it might be "the one" to turn me into a souls-like believer.  Unfortunately that didn't happen.  It seemed cool from all the videos I watched, but not very fun once I started playing it.  I couldn't get into the story and lore of it either.  Just not my cup of tea I suppose.
my favorite game


]
it is fun but hard
This is my first ever soul-like game and initially I was worried that I will not like it. Therefore, I decided to wait even tho the game is/was GOTY. I bought Elden Ring few months ago after finishing Cyberpunk and needed something to play while waiting for Dragon Dogma 2 to come out ( what a shit show DD2 turned out to be lol). I absolutely LOVE this game. I am about 160 hours in, and still exploring Lyndell capital which means I have tons more to do.

it's been a wild journey for me, I am not gonna lie. I've had moments were I was like "screw this, I am done!!!" hahaha. It felt like torture at times, but something about this game kept pulling me in. I felt drawn into the game despite the immense difficulty, which is , I guess part of what a soul-like game is. 

The lore and story is amazing, and how can it not be? it was written by G.R.R Martin after all. The voice acting is crazy good and the graphics is breath taking. The world building is one of the best I've seen. No dungeon or cave feels the same, monsters and creatures are diverse and there is so much to explore, it is overwhelming.
The game does not hold your hand by any mean. You got no quest log, nothing that tells you where to go. You get vague clues from NPCs and that's it. You are on your own. From someone who comes from Ubisoft games (yea yea I know, don't judge me), Elden Ring feels like climbing the Everest for the first time. 

Pros

- Amazing Story
- Amazing Graphics
- Amazing World
- Amazing Combat system
- Bug free and very stable
- huge variety of armors and weapons 

Cons

- locked to 60 FPS ( no idea why they did that but there must be a reason )
- no support for ultra wide screen ( initially I thought it would bother me, but you get used to it)
- very hard to figure out quests without looking up hints online. I get the whole idea of exploration and stuff but some quests give close to zero clues. 

I can see why this game won GOTY award. It is really one of the best games I've ever played and I haven't even finished it. Elden Ring set the bar so high for action RPG games, I don't think it will be easy to dethrone it.
yes

this game makes me cry sometimes but its fun
One of the best games OAT with out a doubt. If you're looking for a fun challenging PVP game this is it.
One of From Software's masterpieces.
this game is so amazing the strory the bosses the everything that words cant describe it even if i am 30 tries stuck on the 1 boss i still love it and i cant hate it at all thats how amazing this game is you can be stuck and rage at a boss so much but when you defeat it its game changer.JUST BUY IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT TRUST ME
game of decade
very goooooood
I wish it wasn't locked at 60fps because this is one amazing RPG
liked all
An amazing experience.
Enormous game and well executed.
This is the best game I've ever played a complete 10/10, this is a game that you can tell that the creators put their hearts into and I wish to see more of these games in the future.
I only have 3 hours but have played the game on a different account for more then 50 hours atleast. This game is so good its crazy, its everything you want in a game, exploration, lore, difficulty, good map design, good bosses, good weapons and combat. Cant wait for the DLC.
good
I want more
The game you need

You don't have the right O' You don't have the right
IT GUD
its hard
it reminds me of spaghetti :D
the game is actually really good, like insanely good, it contains everything good about the whole dark souls franchise thingy: combat, story telling, bosses, gameplay, NPCs, etc.
Yes, it is difficult, and easy at the same time. Every combat field like a boss fight, but you can easily outfarm the enemies, which is somewhat a cheat code in this game. Try it out, another win for FromSoft.
big tree wow
Spawn in. Die walk 5 meters. die. Get really strong. Die to boss. Most fun I've ever had
good gam
best game ive ever played
ELDEN BLING

Great game love the story buff radahn he's to eazy to kill.
So much fun. Just - so much fun!

Beautiful game, the artwork, the characters, the level design. Its unmatched, with the difficult bosses and the challenging puzzles Elden ring will surly scratch that adventurous itch

Amazing game, only disappointing things about it is one late game area and horse combat is next to non-existant.

very fun and enjoyable, but I wish there was cross platform so i could play with and against my friends.

This game is one of the hardest I have ever played but the satisfaction from killing a boss is amazing.There is so much to explore and discover, you can create a character build on anything, would highly recommend.
fun game to play with friends
They did it again and made another masterpiece! Beware of becoming maidenless!
Good open world. Challenging bosses. World dungeon bosses are repetitive though.
pretty fun but still dont know what im doing

Much more enjoyable with Seamless Co-op, FromSoft can really learn a valuable lesson from modders.

First download game, then seek elden ring
Game has great theme goin on but thats basicaly it. Boss fights are 10 minutes of "wow this is bullshit!", 10 minutes of learning when to dodge and thats repeat for the whole game. Thats if you can even find the bosses you need to kill, Elden Ring has made sure that you will never have any idea of where to go next. If you wish to play this game you will 100% need a guide in order to progress due to there being basicaly 0 indicators on where to go. To sum it all up, boss fights is just learning when to dodge there is no difficult mechanics despite that being the whole selling point, it is nearly impossible to know where to go to continue your quests and you spend most of the time searching for loot and where to progress instead of doing sick fantasy medival fights. 4/10 gameplay stinks and is carried by people who cope that it is a hard game or people who dride the theme
Pope Dog :)
An incredible open world action rpg in the "souls" series of games.
I love everything about this game, it is HARD but it is also beautiful, vibrant landscapes, intricate character backstories and quests, a plethora of armor weapons spells and accessories.
The feeling you get when you come across a new area with such an incredible diverse landscape, its amazing. I've never played a game that made me feel so small, yet so mighty! 13/10 stars for me!
BAD GAME

love <3
W game. The game of all games.
One of the best, If not he best open world rpg i have played in recent years. The depth of the world in this game is never ending. If you are looking for a game to sink time into, and challenge yourself, this is the one! I honestly can't put into words how amazing Elden Ring is.
Good game
It's Dark Souls, but bigger. Yes, that's it. And it should be more than enough of a reason for anyone to play it.

FromSoftware has proven more than enough times that they're extremely capable of developing insanely memorable settings and encounters at a much smaller scale, and Elden Ring is their attempt at doing so for something that is, simply put, ridiculously big. With a much less linear progression and George R. R. Martin's influence, this game gives you a unique sense of wonder that simply can't be matched by any other.

You may ask: "Why is another open-world game worth my time when there are so many others like it out there?". The answer is that this is no normal open-world game, and I believe marketing it as such did it a fair amount of disservice. Elden Ring is filled to the brim with content, places to explore, creatures and enemies to find, items to discover, story to uncover (and fail to understand). Yes, it is less restrictive in progression than FromSoftware's previous games and the area the map covers is indeed massive, but it doesn't feel as much as an open-world game as it does simply a bigger Dark Souls that allows you to leave a boss fight or area you're struggling with at the moment to go do something else and come back later, just to find some other path on the way that takes you to a hidden cave you weren't aware of and ending up exploring a completely different place for hours on end until you remember what your original goal was. Is "open-world" the right term to describe this type of experience? Perhaps, but I feel like it's distinct enough in this case to warrant a clarification.

Regardless of that, this game is truly one-of-a-kind. Familiar enough for Dark Souls fans and welcoming enough to those who are playing it as their first FromSoftware game. It is harder to find reasons to not recommend it that aren't either ridiculous, nitpicky or simply a warning about how overwhelming in size and content it can be.
Perfection
I've little new to contribute, but want to say that Elden Ring isn't a twitch game. For me the biggest obstacle to progress has been my fear of heights. As a 75-year-old I'm glad to say that the game supports exploring at your own pace and taking your time to figure things out. Slower reflexes and dimmer vision shouldn't cause players to assume it's "not for them." I, at least, have been pleasantly surprised..
Y E S !
Let chaos take the world!
This game is one of those once in a lifetime things that when over, leave you in a state of constant longing. This was my first "soulslike" game and boy was I not disappointed. I'm not a "Gamer" and facing the challenging combat of Elden Ring is THE MOST FUN I have had with a game since RDR2.

The lore is deep but subtle and never force fed everytime you interact with the world. That's the main selling point of this game. THE WORLD. The world is beautiful yet unforgiving. It makes you work for everything and gives a purpose to every second you are a part of it.

I loved every second I played. And even though I loved how such games work, I don't think I'll ever try the other Dark Souls game, because frankly I don't think it will get better than this. That's the only downside to playing Elden Ring. VERY FEW GAMES WILL EVER MEASURE UP.

Thanks to the creators of the game for this experience. I'll be definitely be back for the DLC.
 [h1] From Soft went too far with this game [/h1] 
I simply cannot understand how can they design a boss like that. I still have not found a proper guide on it, yes I have tried "googling" but there were no results. I could not find any Youtube tutorials either. Can anyone actually help me?  [b] Or even better FS just should nerf or remove the boss completely.  [/b] 

#NerfSoldierOfGodrick
Very cool world.
Nah, I'd win
9/10, now give us Bloodborne for PC.
more dragons than dragon age
Shit game for mentally ill people

Who wants to come home from work and put themselves through endless tourture?
What a blast. Still starting new playthroughs, would recommend to anyone. Can't wait for the DLC
hooha
Good
Wow, this game. I just love it, even if the majority of the time I am getting beaten into a tiny bloody pulp, I will just keep coming back for more.

Am I a masochist now?
this game gives you so much freedom, much more than the other souls games. during my first playthrough i died to the first boss, then i died again again, and again, and again... but then i left the castle and went somewhere else, got more weapons, better armor and came back, finally got good and killed him. i really like this about open world games, you can go wherever you want (and this game has like 70% of the map available from the very beginning), letting you make whatever build you like  immediately after starting
what the hell is a.
It took me about 2 years to finally say: I am going to try this. 

I have NEVER played a Soulslike game before and actually completed it. I tried a few Dark Souls games but they were just too hard at the time. I feel like maybe now I'd do a bit better, but...

This game is perfect in every way. The sheer feeling of discovering something on your own without looking it up gives me euphoria. Killing bosses after 50+ tries gives me euphoria. The sense of accomplishment. I actually lost my voice a bit after I killed M*L***A.  I would compare the feeling to my wedding day.

To be fair, I did play the game as a mage so I sorta feel less cool than the melee crowd, but I am going to play it again for a different ending very soon, using melee, maybe faith as well.

I also did not want to play this game because of motion sickness. Many many games are unplayable, including the Witcher 3, which breaks my heart. I did not feel motion sick AT ALL even once during this game. Not even the small lull headache that sticks around during the gaming. Nothing. Just good feelings.

If you are on the fence, take the plunge. You will not feel like you know what you are doing but just EXPLORE. Enjoy!

This game is 10/10, perfection. On the same level as BG3.
I've never had this much fun playing dress up before!

Also, don't dump vigor...
So after coming back to this game since i haven't touched it since release all i have to say is it shouldn't have been a open world period. Maybe a bigger map for sure but this game having a huge map hurts it you do one cave and you've done all the caves you do one catacombs you've done all of them pretty much etc etc and you might be thinking well of course the caves and other things were gonna be copy pasted and yea i get that. But the bosses? There is only a handful of unique bosses in this game so few i can count them all on my hands. They should've condensed the game cut half of the caves and stuff and focus on unique bosses and better enemy variety and for those saying oh the dlc might change it remember ringed city? TRASH DLC ringed city was not good and ashes was way too short. All i'm saying is that Fromsoft has yet to release a game as good as Bloodborne. Just go buy a ps4 and play that. Now i'm not saying the entire game was bad there was so great moments AMAZING moments i had in this game but coming back shows all of it flaws really badly overall i would say it's 6.5/10 with seamless it's easily a 8 but you shouldn't have to install mods to make your game better imo. Agree or disagree mald or don't mald idc OG Demon souls, Bloodborne and DS2 were way better.
very nice wonderful
It has a lot of build variety, i love that :)
At some point in this game, the pain it causes you just makes it more fun. So if you like pain and suffering and you have a immense amount of skill then this game is for you. (its really hard)
I wish I die so I could respawn in this universe...
I no longer own such a thing called "Social life" as this game has consumed my soul. Would recommend
The current peak of the Souls series. <3
Possibly the best Souls game, and the DLC is gonna be WILD!!!

This game literally gave me god complex after defeating maliketh no hit.
BEST GAME FR


RP supremacy.
Beware, good game.
Very good
Never play this trash game its waste of oxygen and time so if you want to breath DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
Oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect! Everything, down to the last, minute details.
Heard Radagon was easy, decided to go no weapon just hands against him, got slept instantly. 10/10, would recommend
Game of the year 2022-2024 so far.

Fun game if you like dark soul like games. Almost everything is viable too.

The best game I have ever played by far!!!
Gay game, spammy ass bosses, gay lore gay ross
Bonk

ITS KINDA JUST HARD AND ANNOYING
erm this game is hard....
Absolutely one of the best gaming experiences, a must try if you have not.
Great game but if you are expecting something like dark souls 3 you will not enjoy this at all
Game always got me bumping up laundry day.

Did every ending and got every achievement yet i still die because of FOUR FUCKING SKELETONS SQUATTING IN A FUCKING HEROS GRAVE
Fun game.
wow
Awesome story and difficulty love it.
Probably one of my favourite games of all time, I just finished my first play through on pc and am about halfway done NG+, some amazing bosses (except god skin duo) with an amazing world, if you haven't tried it out it is a great game to introduce you into souls series.
No this is not good game because I finished this game and watched credit and I didn't see anything that thank me for playing this game. I felt very lonely after this .  :c
10/10
holy moley
Very fun game lots to explore
Good
for the first time in a long time i rage quit ( and it wasn't a Boss ) 10/10
I like this game.
caestus parry gives me LIFE
its a good game. if you like you doing 1 day of killing boss.
This game is one of the best games ever to exist. No game that I have played has ever been as frustrating, difficult, anger inducing, made you suicidal but yet no game has ever brought me such joy, relief, happiness, and makes you feel so accomplished. you may be stuck on a boss for days trying to find out what weapons to use and when to attack and when to dodge, and because of the difficulty of the game you feel so so so accomplished after beating that stupid boss whether it be someone early game or late game progressing through the game doesn't take away that feeling it lasts to the end. and if you ever feeling like giving up or quitting this game think about how you would feel after that boss, hey even I thought about quitting it, I was stuck on that dumb duo for 3 days, and i really really wanted to quit but then i thought what will come after them and because of that I beat them and not just them but every boss after them. And because of that I truly think that this is one of if not the best game ever.
very fun

I enjoyed the first opening 20 or so hours of Elden ring and i'm not sure where exactly it happened, but it just stopped being enjoyable. I really liked the bosses in the first few encounters and each of them felt challenging and unique. Then at some point I kept seeing the same enemies and despite equipping better armor, learning patterns, and upgrading vigor I was still consistently being one shot in several boss encounters and sometimes just out on the open world. 

I really don't like to look things up unless i get absolutely stuck on something and i found myself needing to do so more often the more i played. I also can't keep track of the massive amount of people, places, equipment, quests, or where i'm actually at in those quests. I can't understand why some kind of journal wouldn't be included and you are just expected to remember every interaction you have in the game. Like I have a life outside this game and can't always be on it consistently, so coming back to just a 'hey, this is the part you're at in this quest' isn't just a nicety, it's kinda necessary. Not even a waypoint, just some way of looking up people and events.

I had really high expectations from this game and I genuinely don't see it. I feel like my time is just being deliberately wasted with stupidly massive areas, repeated enemies, and having to go through those repetitive enemies for smithing stones, gear, runes, etc over and over and over and over and over again if you don't want to be just one shot after ten minutes against a boss with obscenely inflated health or if you make one or two missteps. 

Still going to try to get through and will change my review if it just inexplicably becomes less of a slog to get through, but i really don't see that happening. 
another fromsoftware banger this time you become the elden lord...
I played this game and died IRL
Everything you've heard about this game is true. Play it.
What an amazing game! I haven't found myself this lost in a world since AC Odyssey. This is my first souls game and my god this has set the bar high.
good
I did not know what to expect with this game, I knew it was well known and extremely good but I did not know what to expect. I first tried this game out about a year or almost 2 years ago and I hated the movement. I could not get used to the slow movement and how long inputs were. I lost interest and came back to it about 3 weeks ago. I had motivation to charge head in and see what I could do. I instantly fell into the loop and have now started to play this non stop. Already clocking in at 60 hours within the span of 2 weeks. I have then asked the community for help because I felt stuck and they were extremely positive. I feel like I now know what I am doing. I love this game and would recommend it to everyone.

TL;DR this game good as hell and try it out even when you think it might not be for you
grass is overrated, Miyazakis swamps are better. ( Miyazaki please let my family go )
Go bonk or go home
good game very easy and not difficult at all
good.
one of the best games i've ever played
I highly enjoy playing this game, especially with friends. It gives a challenge with a great sense of accomplishment when you beat a big boss.
Overhyped, good for the series fan boyz but other than that mechanics are cheesy require zero skill but repetition either on the specific boss fight or in general hours spent on game, visuals are great and the art is amazing sure but I cant get over the fact that the game starts to get boring after a few bosses when you generally have to learn all the shit hit boxes npcs have. Ofc theres the insanely bad port for PC gamers, locked fps, the bad cameras and bad lock/target system zero effort for keyboard mouse optimise/setup etc etc, but I don‚Äôt care to bitch about it like the rest of the haters gank. Just wanted to share that if you don‚Äôt really like the souls series, the game imho is poorly designed to give you a ‚Äùhard challenge‚Äù by basically having overpowered or broken 100% boss fights and you either get a build that destroys them or go after them after you watched videos or died 100 times and know all the sequences or cheese tactic your self. i expected msth better in mechanics from a multi mill production.
Thy game befits a crown.
yes I would recommend this game to other players
The game is honestly goated af, I can admit I just can't git gud and finish it, but even I have to admit the game is worth it if you're willing to put in TIME
Git guud nerds
lots of fun
Such a great game to spend hours on
its so hard but amazing
its like a toxic relationship now matter how hurt and annoyed you get from it, u still cant resist the argue of playing it again
Great Game

-Amazing and engaging game play

What more could you ask for?

gotten gud
This is a game you will at first be scared of, then you will build up the courage to play it, then you will start enjoying it and then... you will spend 3-4 hours trying to kill a boss, without success. Then you will uninstall it, play something else for a while. And then you will remember, that this game is kinda awesome. And then you will re-install it, create a different character, read some beginner tutorials online, and try to play it again. Sooner or later you will realize - this game is probably the most addictive and awesome game ever made. Oh, and - it's freakin' gorgeous and freakin' weird. I love it.
best game ive played in a very long time so addicting
got me no women. i was lied to
best game of all time
Best game I've ever played
gotten whooped the whole time W game
Fortnite basically
Only played a bit on PC so far but put well over 100 hours on PS4. If you think you might, get this game. You will not regret it.
Played this on Xbox first and had a great time. It runs WAY better on Steam. I can't believe I ever played it any other way. Looking forward to the DLC.
Is this game good. I guess... To be frank, I haven't played this game yet. I left it open for 7 hours while I was getting yelled at by my mom. She was mad because I forgot to clean my room of all the litter and stuff. She was so mad. "Why is there 300 cheetos in the closet Bernestoenniemoochachoboognagiomas (that's my real name, I am from Vermont)?" and then she was like saying all this stuff.

Long story short, she yelled, yelled, and yelled. I got so mad, but I was too timid to yell back. Now, she's gonna kill me if I don't smoke a whole pack of cigarettes.
Im not a masochist but...
very fun game as long as you dont overprepare for every boss
Best souls-like. Near-infinite replay value
good game and awsome graphics on computer
LOST 240 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY!!!!
Foul Tarnished
if your playing on pc, you need to have a very good computer or 1 you cant run the game at all like my old computer, 2 its freeze every 0.00001 seconds( keep in mind i have a RTX 3050, core i5, 16 gb of ram) and its does it all the time. if only i could i could play even with a 900 computer i wouldnt be writing this. AND I DONT DISLIKE/ UN RECOMEND THIS GAME IM JUST SAYING YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD COMPUTER
:3
Absolute Masterpiece
I hope all the devs of this game get cancer and aids in there ass
Edit: this game still sucks ass.

Bad at video games?
Try getting good!
Brilliant game.
As an avid fan of Fromsoftware games but not a big fan of open-word games, Elden Ring has gave a immersive experience I haven't felt in awhile. Since it was a more ambitious souls-borne game( e,g, open-world), I was expecting to love the game. Overall the game is well suited for novice players and veterans alike. 

[h2] Open-Worldiness [/h2]

I felt that that the Open World was much more organic rather then gimmicky compared to most open world games I've played or seen. Furthermore, the game mechanics of soul-borne games does go well the format, since the games always empathized dungeons crawling and exploring. 

Moreover, the world is gorgeous. Every scene of the game can be seen as a spectacle. Everything in the map is rendered in the game. If there is a place you see, you can travel to that area. It is quite enchanting to explore the world blind. My first play though was over 120 hours, not because I was struggling but just doing other stuff such as exploring.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
If you are familiar with the souls games, you'll notice they brought back some mechanics present in dark souls 2, such as duel wielding to the game (Not powerstancing though). The gameplay is very fluent and has the familiar souls mechanics but with a few extra additions. For example, there are guard counters -counterattacking right after a block - and jump attacks. The jumping now has a dedicated button!

Weapons, unless they are unique weapons, don't have a fixed skill anymore. Now you can equip skills from items called Ash-of-wars. Different weapon types have access to different skills. For example, a colossal weapon could have access to a ash of war that can slam the ground and cause it to erupt proximate to you, while a thrusting weapon could have a fury of fast strikes. This makes build much more diverse as you can make a weapons more suited to your play style. 

Spells are pretty amazing and more ambitious then they were in previous souls games. There are different schools of magic which can tell you how that spell operates. Faith based magic has had an entire overhaul and is much more diverse. It makes it feel more thematic lore-wise. Unlike in the souls series, where most miracles(faith magic) was similar and too focused on utility. 

[h1] Criticism [/h1]

[b] While I adore the open-world, Elden ring eventually suffers from similar problems with other open world games [/b]

Despite, the world being cool to explore, eventually you lose reasons to go back to areas you already been though. You'll most likely only return to certain areas if you need a certain item.

Also, the dungeon designs and their bosses become repetitive. It really felt like Fromsoft chose quantity over quality with the side dungeons. I didn't really enjoy Catacombs since they felt way too similar and repeated enemies. Caves were more interesting, as they had more unique designs and ways to navigate the dungeon.

Moreover, even though there is a lot of content some areas feel empty, which is one of the big reasons I find the open world gimmick unbearable. Many developers appear to not know how to design well-made open world and only do it because it was a trend. Elden ring doesn't suffer from this as much, since as I said before the environment feels more organic rather then forced. Nevertheless, you start to notice the barrenness as you progress through the game more.

[b] Side quests could have been better then presented. [/b]

I felt there were that many side quests as I expect. Regardless, some side quests felt hard to follow along unless you were following a guide. To be honest, I think Dark souls handled side quests better; though they were more linear so it's not exactly an apples to apples comparison. This is a minor complaint.

[b] Sorcery lack diversity and Utility. It was not utilized to its fullest [/b]

While, I love the magic in this game. I felt like sorcery was not given as much love as incantations(faith based magic). Sorcery is mostly offensive, unlike incantations which have support, healing, and offensive spells. This is a pattern Fromsoft repeated again from the souls games. Sorcery was mostly offensive with some utility, while miracles were support based mostly with a few offensive spells. It appears they only applied this to sorcery, as incantations are diverse and have access to nearly every damage type in the game. I always enjoyed doing spellblade builds, so I am a bit disappointed. Knowing the lore behind sorcery in Elden ring, it doesn't appear it was utilized to its fullest potential. Hopefully the DLC changes this.

Final point...

[b] Can there be more ways of interaction with the environment  [/b]

Fromsoft have been doing the Souls formula for a long time and it hasn't changed dramatically. They can only do it so many times until they to start making changes. Since Elden ring is an open world game, I would expect their to be more ways to interact with the world. Such as more ways to find lore through exploring or interactions you can do with the many area. This would give more purpose to exploring dungeons and other optional areas. Maybe they can add this in the DLC?

 [h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Elden ring is not a game for everyone. If you are not a fan of souls games, you will not enjoy this game. Otherwise, you should try this out. Also the DLC is coming out soon, so it's a perfect time to give it try if you haven't.
verry good
From someone how finished Dark Souls 1,2 and 3, and all their DLSs, if you are in a similar situation but somehow didn't played Elden Ring yet, go for it, don't need to think twice about it, its really an enhanced version of DS3 with much better controls and mechanics, in an open world scenario, this game is simply second to none on this genre.
Best game of all time
fun fun but really hard
Is okay :steammocking: :GDHard:
Elden Wing
I died
I'd do anything for my beloved moon mommy. :ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß(Íàç·¥óÍàç)‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü:
Very fun. Difficult, but easier and more player friendly than DS1
I don't know what to add. This is a lot of fun. You can go completely solo and do it your way. Or, you can use a spectrum from there to a completely tuned PvP killer.
Are you for real checking the game review?
go buy the game

I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said about this fantastic game. Fromsoft honing their souls series formula almost to perfection with this one. There are still minor tweaks that may or may not be added in the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, but those are quality of life tweaks, the gameplay, storytelling, visual spectacles, combat, not much room for improvement there, the bar has been set really high.
Me see game. Game is good. Leave review. Goodbye
Great game hindered by poor balancing and the world with one of the greatest starting areas and worst end game areas I have ever had a chance to witness. Perhaps the DLC gives us what we want in the right amount. Too many copy paste bosses, many builds lead up to the same thing. Everybody use almost the same spirit ashes because you have no incentive to use any other one. Legacy dungeons are great! The issues I mentioned will never be fixed since that was the way they "designed" it. Yeah right. Anyway I still beat the game and had a good time but I just can't bring myself to recommend it.

I would give it something in between recommending and not recommending.

game slaps
If you like hard games you will like this game A LOT like me I recommd know i speil those words wrong anyway this game to you.
best game oat, no debate
It's definitely one of the greatest games ever. I played it on PS5 and PC, no issues at all, only pure fun of world exploration and boss fights challenge. The lore is vast and deep, it will take a lot of time just to comprehend what's going on in this world as it always does in FromSoftware games, but in the end it's one of the best journeys in video games.
Ignore the hours played (4hrs), I also bought this game on SexBox One X Series X and played for over 100hrs (Str Build). This is NOT the PERFECT FROMSOFTWARE game (That's Sekiro), but it is the most expansive, lore heavy, & mechanically diverse game they have ever made. 

The size of the game is truly massive! Just when you think you've found the edge of the map, you will go down an elevator, push through a passage, or activate an item and stumble into a completely NEW area. BUT! There's more! Somewhere in the middle of most areas, you will possible find a passage that leads to the OTHER HALF of that area. 

This is NOT a PERFECT game, nevertheless it offers a consistently amazing experience.
it's alright i guess
I think this game is the best game FromSoftware is made. Maybe because it's a bit more forgiving and easier? I guess I'm just not good at souls game, but this game actually had good progression through the map, there was plenty of area to explore to get you to that level requirement for the next area. I believe this is the best upgrade as for DS3, you have to farm xp just to get to the right level for the next area which is quite tedious.
How this won Game of the Year is truly beyond me.

probably the best game i've ever played
I love this it is legitimately some of the most fun I have playing a game and it is very worth the price

best game
I can't recommend this game enough, you want a challenge, you want adventure, you wanna slay god, you wanna be a lord, well play elden ring. Just prepare for the game to disrespect you.
Elden Ring is still one of my favorite games. The controls on PC in my opinion are a bit wonky coming from a guy who played on PS4 but after a bit you kinda just get used to them. No real bugs and High Quality gameplay.
its good
great just buy
game rocks dude

this game is all dark souls was. although mimics will be missed i have a lot of fun doing multiple builds and dying with all of them
game deserves that GOTY award for sure

[h1]I gotta tell you " it was perfect. Perfect! Everything, down to the last, minute details." [/h1]
My favourite part is when john dark souls collects the elden ring and says the real elden ring is the friends we made along the way.

Amazing game play!

To whoever designed the fire giant make sure your doors are locked and that your house has a nuclear bunker

elden ring ruined my life
great game
goooooooooooooood
In first play through i absolutely suck at the game and would do anything to kill the boss that include using glitch and cheese method to beat them that make me feel like a completely loser in life and my wife and kid left me so one day i decide to restart and finally git gud now i can say that im a parry god but my wife and kid haven‚Äôt return and i still feel like a loser in life
Love this game
Cant wait for Shadow of the Erdtree

Very bad
Goated souls game. So much to do and discover. about 100 hours into my first build and not even 3/4 through
Still no way to manually select what button icons to display....

Just let me choose PlayStation buttons icons....
game
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES, WAITING FOR ITS EXPANSION TO BE RELEASED SOONNNN
This is the best game ever! It feels like a combination of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.
If addicted to your own pain and suffering in an incredible high fantasy, dark and mysterious kinda way then.. yeah. If you don't like games that have a chance of making you so stressed you throw your computer out of your 4th story apartment window then probably not the game for you.
Very Dope!
There's nothing I can say that can give this game the praise it deserves. This is peak. This is perfection. This is everything I've ever wanted in an open world game AND a souls game. The new mechanics feel amazing, the bosses look and fight the best in the entire series, and there is always something new to find in every play through. I love this game, as frustrating as some things may have been (Looking at you Malenia)

I can't wait for Shadow of the Erdtree
Do i need to explain? I mean its a soulsborne game ofc its a W
I'VE GIVEN THEE COURTESY ENOUGH.
Not much to say, great game, some neat improvements to the movement systems but sadly retains the good ol camera issues.
good game
Game is Great
The best game I've played so far. It is complecated, scarry, beautifyl and challenging. Oh yeah, challenging it is!
I'm upset thought that there is no convenient way to enjoy it with friends. Not all locations accessible for a group as well as no fast group ride allowed without additional modes.
Elden Ring is probably one of my favorite games of all time. It has enough challenging enemies to give you a sense of accomplishment when you make it past a difficult boss or area, even allowing different pathways and builds to explore. The risk and reward feels balanced and enjoyable, and it's become something I've played through maybe 3 times as of now, being able to play it with my partner and learn from his experience with the game. I highly recommend this game :)
The best game out there if you hate yourself and want a way to hate yourself even more!

Anything and everything will try to pummel you to the ground, but you've just gotta get back up because how else will you get pummeled again? 

Bring on the beating!
FUCK STeam reviews, everyone is a comedian. Don't EVER read the reviews.
i like big swords
mandela effect. Radagon never was a boss
Good
Please give us Bloodborne Pc Sony
Fantastic Game ,BEST Game in 2022
Shadow Muny Wizord Gang
its just perfect...
mage go brrr
Excellent starter for anyone wanting to begin their souls like adventure.
It has a great and rich story filled with wonderful and tragic characters.
I highly recommend this game and all Fromsoft games.

One of my all time favorite games, great visuals, awesome story and lore.  I'm about 400 hours in and still loving it
best game i've ever played
openworld dark souls with maidens
It is very good
a game you should play at least once in your life
Fuck FromSoftware
fuck ass amazing ass game. Finger butt hole.
Super cool and fun! Wish the story and characters were fleshed out more, but otherwise really good!
just smile and wave boys, smile and wave
Pretty good for an indie dev
Most things are cool
Garbo game, just play Sekiro.
i quit this game early because i couldnt kill the tree armor guy, game is fun tho
I like rocks
yup, it's good.
My first souls game, i think this is a new personal era.

pain and suffering ahead
super duper cool game
I had a very difficult time getting into this game when in initially came out. I love Soulsborne games but for some reason, Elden Ring was not clicking with me. With the recent hype for the dlc and knowing that I was missing out on something special I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did.

 I wish dungeons, catacombs, etc, were a little easier to find and honestly I would have been stumped if it were not for the fextralife website and interactive map. I'm not asking for a giant sign saying "Dungeon to the right" but a little more clarity would have been very much appreciated early in my playthrough.

 The combat is the best in the genre and if a boss is too difficult- go explore the world. It's very easy to become OP in this game, with whatever build you want. I appreciate the added depth that jumping brings to the game too, it feels very natural. 

Super glad I finally got to play and enjoy the game and join in on the experience,
Fucking gem of a game!
This is the best souls game that I've ever played, but, in the same games of this franchise, it has the same problem with the control.

Good:
Graphics
Gameplay
Great Bosses Battles
Sound

Bad:
Control

one of the best fromsoft games ive ever played
W Cinematography
fun
Perfection
STOP! GREAT GAME LIES AHEAD
its beautiful! just beautifullllll!

decent ig
These bosses think they're hot shit until the gang pull and run a train on them in the boss room
Game of the millennium
just do it 

This makes me feel very nostalgic for a bygone era I was never a part of. Damn it we need to go back.
one of the best games there is
As someone who has played over 4700 hours on Dark Souls games, this still meets expectations.
I'd leave a better comment but I don't have the right
very hot gingers
challenging but not unfair
Good game
amazing
The game that made me not only fall in love with Souls likes, but got me to go back and replay the DS games I already beat.  A masterpiece worthy of putting time into learning, and a gateway into a whole new world of personal growth.  Both in depths of rage, and realisation of triumph.
gaming
fye
greatest game i have ever played this is truly peak
The maidens are cool :) (Ranni is hot)
THIS GAME IS AWESOMESAUCE
Played it for the first time a couple of years back and with the announcement of the DLC decided to pick up Elden Ring once more. Even if you're replaying the game, you'll spend so much of your time in absolute awe with how stunning the game looks. Can't wait for the DLC to come out, cause I need more Elden Ring content to consume!
great game

10 out of 10
Just a giant headache.

First run is fun, everythings new. But after that its not worth your time.
by far one of the best games i have played in a long time. was very unsure about buying this game as i havnt played any souls games before but a few lads from work convinced me to buy and give it a go and now i am fully obsessed with the game. 10/10 everything about it is brilliant
This game is like a metaphor for life.  Get schwacked in the nutsack by a cold and uncaring universe, get up, get better and keep coming back.  As long as you keep getting up, keep learning and keep trying, you can do anything, even if at first it seems impossible.
8-847801-52271088=986=-858418752-96=83=8-54705=9638=-740
So much to explore, this game is one of my all time favorites. Can't wait for dlc.
The game can be heavily replayable with different classes each time. You can either rush the main story bosses or explore everything the game has to offer. There is so much stuff that is excellent such as the scenery, gameplay, cutscenes, and items to collect. Each weapon has its skill that you can master and upgrade to be your main weapon or dual-wield. I 100% recommend it to anyone to play. You can install mods such as seamless coop and make a playthrough with your friends from start to finish (up to 4).

In the beginning, youre like "woah kinda fun but still, shit game." Then you hit the second run through. "Ohshit.jpg kinda fun that im gankin some hoes now." Now you have just completely blasted through the second run through. And youre ready to start styling your boy and hitting that larval tear for some new found interests because oh boy this game just became my lil sandbox and im working on my castle. So all in all, yah its kinda fun.
i'm bad at video games but i still love this.
Banger
Played on ps5 and ps4 before, got all achievements on both, and now on steam. Great game, endless runs and hours of entertainment, so good its time to play on xbox. If you can, play it now üåπ
I was debating whether or not to pick this up for a long time, and I eventually decided to go through with it.
Am I glad I did.
This game is one of the biggest games I have ever played, and there is always something new and exiting to do. The gameplay is smooth, and is very fun in my opinion. Plus, the good feeling you get when you finally overcome a tough area or boss is an extremely rewarding experience.
However, this game requires some commitment, and is definitely not easy. If you like games that are challenging, but still fun, this would definitely be a game for you.

great game overall took a while for it to work on pc for me but it is great.
One of the best souls games of all time
best souls game in my opinion
Great game! Look forward to DLC!
amazing scenary and animation.
but still sidebosses are harder than the main bosses
this game fucking sucks. 10/10 highly recommended
Great game, it definitely is worth its value, even if it is not on sale
elben rang
Very fun but difficult game.
yeiopp

The game needs to remove all the flying shit that this game throws at you ,aswell as stupid dogs that run faster than usain bolt on 10 monster energy drinks ,aswell as my militant skeleton soliders falling through the map. 10/10 would repeat every single boss
It was perfect. pefect. everyhing, down to the last detail.
Can't stop
Game of the century.
Could have better balancing and less tedious aspects in some areas, but overall ELDEN RING is truly in its own league.
cool game
It's not perfect, but I struggle think of a better game.
I suck so badly at this game but that is my fault and not the games, this game is beautiful and amazing but it is a surprisei have not broken my controller
Must play
Praise the Dog
tHIS GAME IS HARD I CANT BEAT THE final boSS! But great otherwuise
god tier game and it's hard
I installed, got rekt, and uninstalled.
I repeated this 2 times.
On the 3rd time I finally got gud.
Played evey fromsoft game now. Shit aint that hard, just git gud.
This is a pretty relaxing game, good for unwinding after a long day.
Try Finger, but hole.

Don't listen to the haters, follow your heart, build your own experience (play as a sorcerer)
Jolly cooperation and dead gods! Elden Ring builds on everything the souls series added incrementally through the releases and gives an astonishingly good product that deserves to be played by all.
soldier of godrick made me quit this game
THE BEST GAME OF THE LIFE
This was my first 'Souls' game.The difficulty curve was good! Got the hang of combat pretty quick. You kinda have to or you wont get anywhere heh.

I love open world games, and this did not disappoint! Plenty of things to distract you from the main quest and get lost on a journey of hours upon hours of wandering.

Good

:)
I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing souls games. It has a large variety of weapons to collect with great boss battles. This game also has great re-play-ability due to the variety of builds you can build your class around.
Elden Ring has been one hell of a trip, I've played through this game so many times, Elden Ring is one of those games that's just straight up dangerous to play, once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down for a good while unit sick of it, and even then give yourself a week and you'll be craving to pick up your old sword a become the next Elden Lord
Literally a 10/10 game for me. One of the best games I've ever played.
Can kamehameha bosses 10/10
Best game ever no eceptions
Don't buy this looking for fun, this game will break your spirit until you submit.
10/10
3rd run, best game ever. Praise Miyazaki

This game is insane. Can't wait to play the DLC and be Messmer's baby boi
The best game of all time 10 out of 10 will play again 100 times over!
I hate this game
Game is very fun. Game is big. Is very good.
Interesting
best dark souls 4 game ever.
cant wait for the DLC!!!!!!!!!!
Its a very well thought out and put together game. It's just a really really hard but game.

Good game, port Bloodborne and Demon Souls to PC. Thanks bye

dog ahead
First souls game and I love this game. Wish I could play it for the first time again
Made me suicidal... 10/10
it's elden ring bruh
be wary of boss
therefore attacking required ahead
The hitboxes are immaculate!!!
Honestly if you dont know how to beat Fire Giang git gud
Its hard but amazing

PEAK FICTION
I became a man on this game, therefore it's a very life changing and good enjoyable game.
awesome

Best game i have ever payed !
Overrated and wank, first half of the game is peak, second half is like being kicked in the balls by a steel toecap boot. Just a miserable and unfun experience
It's a tremendous game.  The biggest, HUGE.
10/10 - Perfect, exactly what it took to get me into "Souls-like" games. Challenging but explained, deep but not confusing...and absolutley beautiful. I'm trying not to rush through, even as I start 2 years after release, but it is addictive. There are questions that are answered, the map itself is great, and revealing after studying and exploring, just great. If you're reading to see if you should try, do.

[h2]Ignore everything off the main story path and it's fine[/h2]

There's a a lot of recycled bosses, recycled content, recycled landmarks and recycled enemies in pretty bad mini-dungeons around an actually OK fromsoft Souls game. The more time you invest the worse the side content, its rewards and  its encounters feel. The vast majority of bosses are in multiple times, some are in up to nine times and even big lore bosses have clones loitering around. Some are just normal enemies with a health bar.

They made a game too big for them to populate and it's an issue that becomes very obvious the more content you bother to complete.
seek not for mediocrity but ascend to the highest form of all acheive the elden ring be the elden lord
Be wary of PVP
therefore PVE required ahead
Its Elden Ring! If you haven't heard of it in 2024, where have you beeN?
Great game
best game ever!!
IT'S FUCKING ELDEN RING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I NEED TO SAY (this game is fucking awesome, beware the horse guy at the beginning though)
you are not him
FUCKING GREAT GAME, if not the best. worth everything
Awesome Game !!
I really wanted to like Elden Ring.
After months of hearing praise from all my friends, I decided to upgrade my GPU and actually play the game. Coming from Sekiro, I had pretty high expectations for Elden Ring. At first I was impressed by the visuals, the mystery and freedom the game left to the player. However, as I got accustomed to the games mechanics, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. 
I know how enthusiastic the Elden Ring community is about the game, hardly accepting any criticism, but in my opinion Elden Ring does not have an interesting combat system or a fun gameplay loop. Much of this is largely help back by the "open-world" style of the game. 
I recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into the artstyle, music and assets of the game. This is not the problem here.
Let's start with the combat system: This game punishes you for trying to play certain playstyles and forces you into using crutches to defeat bosses. If you want to play the game "your way" you will have to pay for it with a lot of your time and effort. For example, using summons makes some bosses 10x easier, some bosses are borderline impossible without them. The lack of any early hint or direction for how to start building your character puts you into an awkward position where it is hard to re-spec beyond just points (i.e. upgrading weapons, acquiring gear). Another gripe is just the nature of combat in Elden Ring. This is just my opinion, but dodge-rolling and waiting for an opening, just isn't as fun or epic as Sekiro's high octane fights. Beyond memorizing all attack patterns of your enemies, there is no element of "mastery" involved. It boils down to an arduous grind, which does not get remedied by satisfying rewards or story clues. For me, there is no power fantasy here. In Sekiro I felt like I bested my opponent in a straight duel, with both of us giving everything. In Elden Ring, you are essentially trying to find out how each boss was coded until you find out that you can go after his tail to defeat them. This just isn't fun to me. 
But fine, Dark Souls 3 is also a fan favourite, maybe the combat system just isn't for me or I didn't find the right weapons. What DS3 didn't have is open-world gameplay - something so utterly pointless, the development decision absolutely baffles me. Exploring this "world" is about as interesting as a university lecture on databases. It feels empty, with random enemies scattered all over. What do they offer? Absolutely nothing beyond runes and F-Tier items. It doesn't feel satisfying to go on a 2 hour detour just to find ... nothing. I went in blind, as advised by friends, and while playing I wished I had just watches some sort of walk through and took the shortest path to some of the more interesting enemies. The main bosses are intricate, well designed and hard. Too bad you are kind of forced to explore the empty boring wastelands of the lands between, unless you want to get "vigor-checked."
I think this game's problem is guidance. It is offering too much freedom to the player, so much so that it eliminates a sense of purpose and direction. Often you feel like your stats/gear just aren't good enough to make a fight winnable - not the type of power fantasy I'm after
just fuck around and find out
10/10
This might be the most fun game I have ever played!
Just amazing 10/10
What I would give to play this game for the first time again.

Try finger
But hole
great
this sucks ass (edit: it just gets worse) Melania bad/Elden beast))
I liked that it's so awesome and loved that it's not really bad (character building and lore are immaculate).
GOD GAME
get gud
Pain and Suffering simulator. 10/10
The fact this game is described as the best open world ever by a vast majority of people is mind boggling. The worst Ubi game still feels more alive than this over-hyped thing crippled by terrible UX design and terrible story-telling.
best game ever

10 thumbs up
It's all been said before; fun game
I blow loads in rannis tower
It's a fucking masterpiece
hard to find any game perfect like this one these day
its a  hard game but fun and those who complain its to hard download the easy mod pussy
Become Elden Lord thy filthy tarnished!
my adhd cant handle this
FUCK MOHG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
it's aight. I like it an average amount
I Elden Rang.
Elden Ring is by far most overglorified Miyazaki sacred cow. Never saw so much praise for mediocrity. Yes this game is mediocre at best. 
First of all the open world doesn‚Äôt fit for souls games no matter what you believe but this is true. Sure the sense of scope and exploration will be satisfied for you‚Ä¶.for the first time. There is no way this game should be this big in the first place. I rather have more interconnected world like Demon souls or Dark souls where everything felt more fluid and in place. ER feels more like soul draining experience after some while. 
And here goes another revelation. To many overused mini bosses and in some cases main bosses become just another ‚Äútrash‚Äù mob walking in the field. Whoopie what an amazing discovery. I swear to god if you out of ideas why you creating open world in the first place? If you have been in 10 dungeons then the rest of 25 dungeons will be the same ones with same trash mobs and same mini bosses. Not even that but the worst part is when they started to add in the end of a game really really unnecessary difficulty mobs or should I say mini boss mobs that hits like truck and feel more like you fighting a boss but not a trash mob.  Again they lost their understanding what made their previous games so special and unique. 
The biggest shameful detail about this game is about boss encounters. Well what do you expect when you become to big and start to lose your mojo. Every major boss in this game has to many flaws. They move so unbalancing fast and do 5-6 hit combos that you are left only for misery. Someone gave good analogy: you move like Dark souls hero sluggish and slow but the rest of the enemies and especially bosses move in Dark souls 3 speed. Not even that but majority of them have to much of aoe moves. Thes pamming of aoe in this game by bosses is ridiculously funny. So where that leaves us? That leaves us in spot where you cannot recover where you cannot even hit them or have time to react because here comes another 5-6 hit combo and if you are not prepared better summon those silly spirits. This game was not designed for solo play. 
This is by far the most unbalanced game I‚Äôve experienced from From software. Either its to easy if you use summons or its to hard if you try to solo it. Very dissapointed by this game. Wished they returned to the form again where there was a balance in fights where bosses were memorable encounter but not just another grey bob standing but with different hat.
errrrrrrrrrrrrr
im awakening masochism
solid

Finger but hole
shit fire as hell

fore-skin duo
FUN
Getting this game at a discounted price does not make up for the hundreds of dollars on replacement controllers.
Astonishing gameplay!
So much things to be explored!
Many interesting quests and NPCs!
Bosses are not easy but fun!
Not for those with weak heart though~
Prepare to get mentally breakdown!
was called maidenless but would still recommend
good
it's fun
I explored every cm of the map and I can say its probably the best and most ambitious dark souls game.

The only thing shit about it are bosses, poorly designed and not memorable most of them, compared to the other games from FS.

The world design, finding items and secrets was a joy to explore.

The horse riding and combat is a very cool addition, the mounted combat being almost a new kind of gameplay that I enjoyed a lot.

The ashes of war and spirit summons are a nice addition. The crafting is also nice but barely used it.

The mechanics incorporated from Sekiro are a nice but do not add much to the game.

I liked the weather effects and time of day addition.

All in all, good experience, waiting for the overpriced DLC now.
A true masterpiece
14 hours into the game and it is amazing if you dont mind smashing your keyboard
awesome

If you like to just fuse in a game or chill while listening to a podcast
this game is for you
Its hard for new players but rewarding
Malenia is a bitch, but there is a well-noticed script that she casts the waterfall ALWAYS when you deal her a lot of damage in a small timespan. This can be abused to predict when she is going to beat the shit out of you and run away in advance
Dark Souls II 2

It's ok.
i want to talk to the guy that made the valiant gargoyle duo boss fight, i just want to talk

Perfect blend of gameplay and atmosphere.
10/10 IGN
souls but easy mode
My favourite game of all time, and I'm not even a real Soulsborne fan.
"After investing a staggering 301 hours into Elden Ring, I can confidently say that it stands as a towering monument in the realm of gaming. From the moment I stepped into the Lands Between, I was entranced by its vast, interconnected world, teeming with secrets, challenges, and wonders waiting to be discovered.

The depth of lore and the intricate storytelling woven into every corner of the game kept me engaged throughout my journey. From the enigmatic characters to the haunting landscapes, Elden Ring delivers an unforgettable experience that transcends mere gameplay.

Combat in Elden Ring is a delicate dance of strategy and skill, where every encounter feels both punishing and exhilarating. The thrill of overcoming formidable bosses and mastering complex combat mechanics kept me coming back for more, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.

But perhaps what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its sense of freedom and exploration. The vast open-world beckons adventurers to chart their own path, uncovering hidden treasures and forging their own destinies amidst the chaos of war.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that sets a new standard for open-world RPGs. With its breathtaking world, captivating storytelling, and deeply satisfying gameplay, it's a journey that will stay with me long after the credits roll. FromSoftware has once again proven themselves as masters of their craft, and Elden Ring is their magnum opus."

I didn't take the time to figure this game out. Couldn't get into it.
This game did not give me skin cancer (Not cool) but it did gave me brain damage.
The game is very good i would recommend to people who are ready to break their keyboard.
Its peak.
nice game, noob friednly super easy, nimmt quasi an die Hand
best oat
My very first souls-like game. The first round I rage quit. A couple of months later I gave it another try with a more relaxed approach and absolutely enjoyed it. Spent almost 200 hours in that game, massive and diverse world, beat every boss. One of the best games I've ever played.
best game
real gud 

this game sucks because it makes every other game look like the worst shit ever
Yes
i feel bad that from software paid george rr martin to do world building only for chumps like me to barrel through dialogue and skip every cutscene to mash L2 even faster but anyways this game is really fun
one of the top ten greatest games of all time
This game is the tits bro.
Hearing the narraton moan everytime I go into ng+ is the sole reason i haven't killed mslf!
noice
bestest
easy game
very nice

.
i know game game is hard but the game have more than what i think  but it still hard
its a really good game but took like 73 hours to get past this soldier of godrick but after that its even worse im fighting the tree sentinel maybe im just not a good player but still try it out. i have also heard that there is a really strong enemy that jumps down on to you after entering a gate really strong enemy huge payout.
Remember the Quantum kerfuffle? That's how good this game is; you literally need to not play it to not realize how feature-rich and enjoyable it is.
One word, "too good"
it makes me wanna punch my grandma but i love it sm 10/10 would recommend unless you have anger issues then please don't get this game
dog ahead
I pray every night that miadzaki will be getting hit in hell with a 5-15 seconds delay so he can never guess when he is getting slapped after what falling from 3 feet and dying... The game is def not as hard as many think it is just like taking your time to learn patterns and timings. I think people just hate themselves if they enjoy that game but not the world and story, which you still have to figure out yourself. It feels like they might have just added things so people could finish a story that they couldn't.
If I could only play one game in the world this would be it.
it's ok i guess
best game i've ever played
very fun
Very fun
This my was my first Souls game and I'm glad I got into it. Well worth the hype! This game was kind of hard (still is) but once I put my foot in the water and started looking up proper builds, the game became way more fun and somewhat easier. 

It has lots of amazing visuals, the voice acting is superb and don't get me started on the lore! There's so much to this game than meets the eye. Expect to die a lot as well.. lol
first off,

congratulations
best game of the decade
this game made me a boy to a man
First time playing it and im really enjoying it I would recommend this to anyone whos willing to go for the challenge this game brings.
its fun hoooooooooooooooooray!!!! 

also big big dragon cool
cook
Malenia doesn't have shit on my glorious King LeBron
Amazing game, amazing detail, amazing lore
The best game I have ever played.
Juegazo, 100% recomendado. Time sink
Miyazaki i love you and i fucking hate you at the same time <3
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella
10/10 game
graphics and game play, music, systems are all very detailed and top of the line.
character development and storyline are terrible, extremely overrated.  entirely forgettable story which is a huge let down.  unless you super love games that grill you on perfect timing of hitting buttons, pass.  that's what this game is, a very pretty perfect timing game. i wish i knew that ahead of time and spent my money elsewhere.
bonk :D
erdtree bright.. got smacked alot 10/10
best
I am sexually attracted to this game
Yeah
Worth
Good, better if sex. :)
I fully believe my first playthrough would have been 120 hours if I had no guide. This is my first soulslike and I am an idiot.

Other than that 10/10
dog
Best Game Ever
Its Elden Ring. What else is there to say? Amazing game and amazing change to the formula. Highly recommend.
Based game
me and turtle pope are best friends (real) (not clickbait!!)
Arise ye tarnished

you will need to search guides for completion of achiuevements

i am malenia blade of miquella- the most annoying ass boss :(
Fantastic game. Only down side is the frustration but that's an individual problem so...

Can't wait for the DLC
the game is hard but fun if you're looking for a challenge buy this game its worth it
.
Game is ok, its just Dark Souls 2 but bigger and with more berserk reference..
This was my first Souls Game. The experience was fun, I looked up everything though. It was still the peak era of gaming in 2022. I got it on computer and still play it decently. If you are looking at this before playing, do not look stuff up. Just find stuff as you progress and speak to the npc's, dont rush through the game
The GOAT
Elden Ring
fun lol
I used to play this game with my ex girlfriend. However, unlike everything else I used to do with her, this is still something I really appreciate. This game is truly wonderful,
Was it worth 59.99?
yes.
Do I enjoy torturing myself?
yes.
Bonk go Bonk
Just get it, no regrets, lots of fun!
One of the greatest games of all time, only surpassed by clearly the more respectful brother Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Meme.
i like balls
I do not know what i have done in my life...
Self torturing....
gud game

So much content! Lots of different styles to play. Fun :D
yes very nice
Yes even tho being hard as fuck is a really great game
Runs like garbage, even on low settings. Ugly interface.
fun
I have 200 hours on my PlayStation in this game.
It started my love affair with From Soft.
You should play Elden Ring.
yes
This game is really yes. I would recommend getting if your a beginning gamer. Also make sure you fight the big horse guy at the beginning also every npc you come across make your you hit them at least 3 times so you get better stuff. and don't do bleed or int build they are the worst and you will have very hard beating game. what I would recommend build is strength build because it's very easy to use and fun because big bonk,
Timeless.
Beautiful game
i liked tarnished
üê°AUGH...rise now, ye Tarnished. Ye dead, who yet live!
Very good gummi snodd

Game of the Decade
I've never had so much fun dying
Love this game! The lore is amazing
amazing
:(
Women's scared me
Beautiful game. Will kill you alot
Unwated clapping

Miyazaki will you marry me?
One of the best games I have ever played. Legendary Souls title. Hot characters. Fire gameplay. Amazing graphics. Exquisite open world exploration. Awesome bosses. Killer story.

Only bad thing I have to say about this game is: too many repeat bosses and reskins for the dungeons.

Worth every cent 9/10
üëç
ez game
Even if you never beat it, It's a fun game. The fact its unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand makes it feel like an actual adventure. YOU have to figure things out and YOU have to get better. There will be hints along the way and you can even summon a friend or stranger for help. Git Gud isn't really an insult, it's actually the best advice you can receive, because that's your only option. Improve or die.
best game ive ever played

Worth every cent

Having platinumed Elden Ring twice on PS5, I recently jumped into the PC version in anticipation for the upcoming expansion. FromSoftware's reputation precedes them, and despite launch issues on PC, their games never fail to captivate. Even after over a hundred hours on console, this game continues to awe me on PC.

The gameplay remains as immersive as ever, drawing me into its intricately designed world and keeping me on the edge with it's intense combat. While not as replayable as some of FromSoft's other titles, this game still manages to feel fresh upon new playthroughs. With the expansion on the horizon, anticipation is high, fueled by FromSoft's history of delivering stellar DLC content.

In the end, FromSoftware proves once again why they're masters of their craft. As I prepare for another journey through The Lands Between, I'm reminded of the studio's prowess in forging unforgettable gaming experiences. I'm looking forward to exploring the Land of Shadow and kicking Messmer's ass (getting my ass kicked) in June.
stength build on top if you dont use it youre a pussy
Very good game, kind of a bad port though.
PS5 recommended
If only I had giant
but hole
malenia died in three tries

gud game :)
The rabbit hole this game will send you down with its lore alone will keep you hooked if you like insane stories!
Im currently returning to the game because of the dlc announcement, im pretty excited to come back because the game is amazing, yes, you kinda get "Burned out" of the gameplay after a while,  but its just fun, I had only 66 hours in steam but I have around 120 on ps5.
fucking bullshit game, the delayed attacks a raping me. i hate this shit, fuck you thomas
good
So, not much by way of instructions. Go play the game, it evolves as you level. Wonderful scenery, critters, enemy's, bosses. Great transportation system; run, horse, portal.
I would suggest not reading guides until you are level 40, will be funny to see the basic stuff you missed along the way....! Fun to go back! 
Top level I heard is 731....!!!!!
I recommended this game 10\10
RANNI IS MINE AND MINE ALONE!!!!
An incredibly fun and exciting game. It was my first entry into the world of Fromsoft games, and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend the seamless coop mod as well, as it is incredibly fun to play with friends. Definitely worth a try, and couldn't recommend more.

Bloodborne PC version come on !!!
Best replayability I've experienced in any game. My first Souls-like. Love the difficulty. Have enjoyed a lot getting good. Fantastic lore. Terrible storytelling, though.
W game
this game is da beeeeest
its good(it consumed my entire life in a matter of weeks)
good gamer game
I found out I really am an idiot for waiting to buy this game 2 years after the release. Probably the best game I've ever played in my life

A solid game, another entry to a soulsborne game but instead of a linear story progression it's all open world! 
special new spells, weapons, and armor. The story is cool but a typical kind from fromsoftware of the depth is there but you need to go digging. overall a solid 9/10
must play
It feels a little more vast and empty, and at times less rewarding than other Soulsborne, but the content is there, albeit spread out. It reminds of someone pointing out the difference between Banjo 1 & 2. Bigger map doesn't mean anything if the content density is reduced. But empty grassy field simulator is the meta for games of the early 2020s i guess.
Can't wait for the DLC to elevate the experience, as every Soulsborne DLC consistently does.
Another classic
mogged
mmmmgood game
YES
Do a barrel roll
Foul tarnished. Thou, marred by the flame of ambition. Someone must extinguish thy flame, or have it writ upon thy meagre grave. Felled, by King Morgott, last of all kings.
I just think it's probably too hard for the average person to enjoy. I have played and finished all of the other Soulsbourne games (outside of Sekiro, which I've never played) and I just have such a love/hate with this one. Too many times it feels stupidly hard just for the sake of being stupidly hard. Bosses are make up for their blinding attack speed by adding super strength on top of that. It's like every boss studied at the Jose Canseco school of getting roided up out of your mind. I love the world, I love experimenting with different weapons, I love wandering around aimlessly looking for secrets. I hate that every other boss feels like an insurmountable brick wall.

I'm at the end, 2 bosses to go. I've beaten Malenia, just Radagon and the Elden Beast remain. I've gotten to the point where I don't want to struggle, and learn anymore. I just want to summon my Mimic Tear and get to the end of this thing as soon as possible.
gud
You really really need to be into open world games and have like a month of free time to play nothing else.
Elden Ring overstays its welcome by far too long.

pretty good
An excellent game, FromSoftware found a wonderful addition to their formula. Having a hard time against a boss? Go away, do something else and come back stronger & more experienced. If you like the sub-genre this game is probably something you already own.

10/10
I have not seen another person in three months because i've been playing this game. When I was ordering from subway, I tried rolling when the cashier handed me my change.
Liar ahead
Amazing is just the beginning of describing Elden Ring! Immersive, at times challenging, and friendly to any player just getting into Souls-like gaming. This game is open world and does not have a journal to keep track of quests in-game, however, there are plenty of guides online to use to follow along. With New Game+ this adds a whole replay factor, so if you didn't get a chance to find something in your first play-through you can hop in again with your current endgame level and obtain it; items, weapons, level, and spells carry over to the NG+. Multiple endings to unlock as well! For anyone wanting explore and get lost in a game, and get silly with builds, I highly recommend Elden Ring! 20/10
i like
Open World Souls-like? Hell yesssss
Very Fun to play with any build !! Also Blaidd is the goat
its a great game.  Keeps your heart pounding and screaming at the game for dying in such a stupid way.   Just when you thought you had the boss beaten something happens and you die...   Ugh... Love this game..
best game ever

11/10 Elden Rings/Erdtrees. Erdtree is love, Erdtree is life.
best game!
Love it and hate it at the same time

Dog
better than dragons dogma
its fromsoft
Believe it or not after 300 hours I haven't beaten this game, I would always start a new character around farum azula one of the best games ever made and with the dlc coming out its a must have even if you find yourself gravitating to more pvp/co-op experiences there is systems and mods to facilitate such playstyles
even though bloodborne is my favorite from game, i have to say this is they're best souls like.
magic succ
also why magic op
praise magic!!

perfect game endless fun 

life is suffering üëç
Went in not knowing if I would get into it or not, now it's one of my favorite games ever.
Elden Ring pretty good but worse than DS2, which is an exceptional game. Still, not many games are better than DS2.
The best game I have ever played.
You tarnished ni**** crazy if you really think you can come up in my tower and try to rip me off this pure fine pack of rocks. This shit got stardust in it ni***, smoke this shit you finna turn into the Elden beast or some shit.
gud game, get gud
I SUCK AT THIS GAME! ITS AMAZINGLY HARD(wait...) JUST LIKE ME(pause)
To every living being, and every living soul. Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon. Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.
im crazy
This is my new favorite game of all time. I have had it for about 9 days and I already have 90 hours logged. I work full/overtime every week. I feel like a crackhead - I literally cant stop playing and really need to get my sleep schedule back on track. But, in all seriousness: the world-building in the game is unbelievable, it is very challenging, and artistically beautiful. I love it. 10/10

ujh
This was my first Souls game and was more than I had hoped for. The shear size and magnitude is hard to explain. Even after hundreds and hundreds of hours playing, I still find new areas and items. The story is great and the game mechanic is spectacular.

id give up my first child for this game
Miyazaki suckakaki
5-5 a true master piece
*Bonk* Unga Bunga Good Game
Despite it's many flaws, this is still easily one of the best games I've ever played. Period. I don't care that it's a AAA title under a big-name developer and publisher, this is a genuinely great experience. Not all of the gear is very special, but there are some very fun/cool builds to be made. The world is rich and evocative, on par with the original Dark Souls and Bloodborne in my opinion. This is also one of the few games where I actually just sit in one spot for a while and marvel at the scenery and landscapes. This actually feels like a grand adventure described in the medieval fantasy stories and old fairy-tales that inspired it.
it's fun
[
hi
Best game i have ever played
its hard like me but jk theres no buts its just super hard like me
noice
Masterpiece best game ever! Highly recommend.
Can not wait for the DLC ;)
This game is extremely boring. In most games, you get to point where you die a lot and feel rewarded when ever you beat the  boss. Not in this one. You can't have any time to gather your bearings, you have no time to think, and most importantly, no time to have fun. I don't understand how people enjoy this type of game.
I no lifed this game on PS5 and now PC
perfect game at all aspects
Try, finger rump.
a game of shit, dont waste ur time and money
gud
great game

Good fun game! Make sure to head straight East after you first spawn!
first time playing a "souls" game love it kinda hard but im learning the fighting mechanics still. but highly recommend
I need to get good
una completa obra maestra, 11 de 10 y god.
The fallen leaves tell a story. There is no aspect of the Lands Between that is not thought out, explained, or left to be discovered by the player. This is the game that introduced me to the souls-like genre and is most definitely one of, if not, my favorite game of all time. 3 NG's in and I still get excited to fight that silly Grafted Scion. 

There is nothing that compares to Elden Ring.
very fun

i recommend elden ring to all type of gamers as u can build and play how u wants. u dont need to be skillful to play this games, u can play it casually because it has so many item. contrary to popular belief, elden ring did have an easy mode, u just need to earn it.
The funny big men love to rape you.

yes
This game beats you up over and over again, but the feeling of finally beating that boss you've been stuck on will always keep you going, and with an incredible story to back up its massive world the game feels alive in a way many title's aren't.
good game üëç

The only game in the last 5 years that actually deserved my money.

pretty damn alright if i say so myself!

May chaos take the world!
I enjoyed the game but on first playthrough made a mistake of going for holy damage (I played the game almost 100% blind) and had a bad time with later bosses and their holy rez. My friend adviced me not to use summons as they trivialize the game, and they do. The balance is wierd at best and most bosses have at least one F*** U attack that will instakill you if you have not been farming runs for extra hp. Personally prefer DS1's slower fights, to me the deaths seem less bs. Or mabe should have gone for INT build and it was a skill issue. Don't know.
Game is very much yes
This ring, it is elden.
i get my a$$ handed to me constantly.
Malenia is so hot
one of the greatest games I've ever played.
Buy game, Ranni best girl, that is all
well, its not dark souls and its not nearly as difficult as dark souls, and George RR Martin is.... well he wouldnt be my choice for creating the lore of a game but all that aside, its a really decent game. well done fromsoft well done.

don¬¥t let the nerds bully you into playing in a way that you don¬¥t like.
use the wiki, use ashes, use cheap weapons, cheese bosses. it does¬¥t matter as long as its fun.
this game is fun no matter what and feels especially great on replay.
fromsofts second best game.
10/10
Good gaem
I dont think they couldve made a worse souls game. Dont get me wrong i love the souls games but this is hot shit, i really hope they learn from this and make something better in the future, open world makes everything more complicated than it needs to and it kind of a spit in the face to fans of the previous games this  the weapon upgrade system is shit the minibosses espeically are some of the most gimicky and clunky bosses ever. Who in there right mind over there thought these would actually bring joy in beating, when i beat these bosses i am filled with nothing but resent and hatred what i just killed i am not happy i am relieved i dont have to live through that but these bosses bring no true enjoyment when killed. The game is beautiful ill give it that. Ray tracing also works like shit, i don't see any difference in ray tracing just a huge performance hit really. If you are a fan of souls games i plead never buy this hunk of shit it will RUIN what is souls. The only cool thing about this game is the end game, the haligtree, the ruined capital. DO NOT BUY
Miyazaki and the FromSoft team have done it again. 10/10 would bang
i play as gojo pretty nice (and also got a mental issues and no life because of this game)
No girlfriend,no social life,no friends ... but 200h in Elden Ring .

I have purchased and refunded this game 7 times. Looking forward for my 8th time.
nice
My first souls game, and it didn't disappoint. 

Amazing game!
10/10. absolutely phenomenal, each boss has its own difficulties and are all entertaining and cinematic masterpieces in their own regard. everything in this game is flawless, and the story is gorgeous yet morbid. This game is worth every single PENNY. Miquella shall be saved in the DLC.
all i have to say to the negative reviews is..... you're bad

This game makes me hate myself. 10/10

[h1] Elden Ring's Beauty [/h1]

I want to firstly address that Elden Ring was my personal Game of the Year in 2022. 

I've been meaning to finally give this game a well deserved review before the DLC releases later in 2024.

If you've managed to play any From Software games in the past such as Dark Souls, BloodBourne and Sekiro, you may be surprised and even overwhelmed at the sheer size of Elden Ring's map, as it covers a wide density of areas above and below the depths of the surface. The more you continue to play, the more you are exposed to the sprawling amount of content at your feet, even right at the beginning of your journey.

Unfamiliar to the other entries of the game, Elden Ring will allow you to have the pure freedom to begin pacing throughout the game at your own leisure. Whether it be collecting resources for armor and potions, or jumping head first into a boss fight you're completely under leveled for, this game certainly doesn't hold your hand. It promotes exploration and allows you to always come back to specific zones whenever you feel more comfortable to tackle those challenges that await you. 

When it comes to Dungeons and catacombs, the design and layout of each dark and claustrophobic space is packed with monsters awaiting your every turn, and levers or mini puzzles for you to solve before you can then progress to fight the boss which occupies the area. Whilst the sheer amount of these catacombs have plenty to offer, as you progress you may start to notice some repetition in the way certain creatures are presented to you as the final challenge. This is one slight nitpick, but by all means doesn't take away from the full experience of Elden Ring.

The world of Elden Ring presents a beautiful soundtrack, which also brings along some truly breathtaking graphics as you may find yourself atop of a mountain, yearning to take a screenshot as soon as you can to capture what's in front of you. The OST massively compliments each boss fight, as you continue to find ways to bring down the mighty foe, your ears are continuously blessed with some fantastic instrumentals in the background.

Touching upon boss fights, Elden Ring keeps the challenge high for newer players to the genre, and even Souls Like veterans. You can choose to fight solo, co-op with your friends, summon other players across the world, and even bring out your bell to summon Spirit Ashes you continually collect throughout your playthrough. These Ashes vary in their ability to deal damage and attract attention to the creature you're fighting, so always use them to your advantage to understand how the boss attacks, and to find the most appropriately timed opportunities to land your hits. Each main boss is presented very strongly, some more so than others, with their look and aesthetics of character design truly being something that stands out to be taken in and appreciated by the player.

Something that works so well in Elden Ring is the freedom to mix and match different armor sets and weapons. The game incorporates magic, range and melee attacks, with even more damage type abilities ready to be implemented in the new DLC. It is incredibly satisfying to level up a weapon you love and see it deal a tremendous amount of damage to an enemy on its initial landing. As with other Souls games, you navigate through levelling your core attributes such as Vigor, Endurance, Strength and Dexterity, and this grants you many different ways to focus your build around, as the replayability of Elden Ring is truly on another level if you're someone who loves to create new builds and characters.

I understand and stress that this game won't be for everyone, especially if you like games with quest markers and a traditional way of telling you what/where to go next. But, if you do end up giving Elden Ring a try, please remember to take your time and soak in the first experience to its true potential as nothing can beat that initial immersive playthrough.

[h3] Happy gaming team! [/h3]
The best Soulsborn game
its the best souls game ever
ELDEN RING
dog :)
Cant wait for the DLC
Best game I've played in a while
The graphics are amazing, Can't want will the DLC
Just phenomenal
game is mid asf
One of the Best Games of all time. And I played a lot of them. Trust me.
still butthurt about gow losing to this shit
5 stars, just buy it!
awesome and difficult
After putting in many hours into this game I can confidently say that the game is good except for one big nuance 

- OPTIMIZATION, elden ring stutters and requires a powerful enough CPU. Everything else is perfect I've gained a lot of enjoyment from it and can recommend this game to others
absolutly love this game
maybe the real elden ring was the friends we made along the way
If you see Santa coming down your chimney this year, make sure to ask him for Elden Ring, the best that only you can get. And for your other gifts, ask him for a personal pan pizza and some napkins.
Ohhh Elden Ring
One of the best games I've ever played. Beautiful visually, in-depth lore with intriguing mysteries, endlessly fun and creative combat gameplay, and weird and gross as heck bosses. 10/10
Beautiful Game!
hard as f
It's wild!
The kind of game that separates men from boys
i like farming for 0.5% drops in this game

too fun
Very good, but sometimes bosses will do a whole olympic gymnastics routine before you can get a hit in.
big black balls
GREAT GAME, I WILL BE CLEAR AT FIRST THE GAME IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU FEEL YOUR LOST YOUR DESTINATION, AFTER TIME YOU WILL ADAPT AND YOU WILL FIGHT HARD TO SURVIVE THEN THE GAME WILL CLEAR AND EASIER.
Elden Bling, rolling simulator, git gud

i lost my life playing this game
mhm

When Miyazaki was beaten as a child, the belt was swung with a delay so as not to dodge.

Great game enjoyed every single moment 
THEY BETTER PUT MALENIA  IN THE DLC
great game some times buggy
Try finger, but hole
I think Ranni should step on Soran.
this games hard at first but after margit its gets super fun
my nan fell down the stairs while I was playing this.
I just finished the game and i have too say it was everything i hoped for. I havent reached every Area yet and i must say im exited for all the extra stuff i havent explored yet. Plus the second that DLC drops its gonna be in my Library. 10/10 game.

Me at 12:00AM: "Okay, just one more Site of Grace then I'll call it a night."
Two hours later: "No seriously, just ONE more Site of Gra--oooh! Gotta check out those ruins over there!"
First playthrough truly is the best game ever made so far in history. 10 out of 10 can recommend even 2 years later :)
dog?
crazy good game
Challenging and tests your patience
"The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking" - Iron Fist Alexander
yeah, kind of too big and too easy. adjustable difficulty for harder challenges would've been great and i say this as someone who played all Soulsborn games except sekiro (which will be my next game).

Even with it's direction which is not directly my type it is still a 10/10 game compared to all games out there but a 9/10 personally as i'd love the said challenge to be present. Walking the opposite path of what the grace tells you shouldn't make you invincible imho. I also stopped leveling at 150 just because it got boring towards the end. Then i started NG+ with another build i never played (also staying at level 150 and not leveling once in the whole NG+ cycle) and finished it in one night sitting and a one hour seesion just this morning with Radagons first phase being the most difficult thing i've encountered (thanks to my new build).
Challenging game but don't give up, there is always somewhere else to go where you can gain power before trying again. Defeating hard bosses gives a sense of accomplishment. Climbing and navigating high areas induces anxiety and makes the palms sweat. Awesome game overall.
Easiest souls game. great for beginners
I've lost years to this game, 10/10
quality game, runs smoothly and great game mechanics. only negative i could raise is that the main story and objectives are not as obvious as i would line.
 This game has taken up all my time. I'm failing 5 classes and are 2 years behind on my mortgage payment. My wife and children will not even look at me for I have neglected them so long. My parents think I am dead because they have not heard from me in years. None of that matters for I must become the elden lord. Isa good game.
Awesome game

what type of dog is this?
GOOOD GAME WILL MAKE YOU CUM HARD
Its elden ring. its good. Get it.
cool


5star /5star
yeah
Best game I have ever played. Full of content and surprises.
yes 10/10
probably one of the awesomest game that ever was awesome. when im playing i just feel epic and it makes me feel so tingly if im being honest. i think if you want a life changing experience you should play this game because you will never be able to live life the same way.
Large world. Great bosses. Lots of secrets. Respects the player. Gorgeous.
I am Malenia, blade of Miquella

Good shit, looking forward to the dlc
Rolling
This game is truly phenomenal, the sheer scale of it all. I don't even know how to begin explaining it to you. Every time I think I've seen all that the game has to offer, I discover something new. Once you really start locking into the world, the better the experience gets.
God Blaidd and Maliketh are so hot
here's how this game is gonna go
you're gonna play
think "i can take him"
get your shit stomped
throw yourself at him for an hour
realise you can in fact, not take him 
turn off the game and cry yourself to sleep
get back on tomorrow
repeat
AMAZING
at the time of this review about 500 hours in and yet still maidenless...
hamburguesa con queso
Beat the game on my PS5, and I'll tell you what. PC is so much harder, especially when you are not used to a keyboard and mouse. It's actually insane. I already knew that this game was the hardest I've ever played, but it's not even a question on the difficulty on this. I never thought I'd say this but it makes gaming feel like all other games are in a lack luster in the console community.. If you think you're a "Gamer" think again. GODAMMNN. Everyone enjoy and be mad because it will get you to that point where you don't wanna play anything ever again. Lol. I stay pushing through, like I always do, but anyway, it's not a game for the light-hearted, nor the average gamer. I'm going to be putting in the hours to make sure my character is up to par with everything that is thrown my way. Knowing Elden Ring like I do, might be easier said than done. GG.
An AMAZING GAME as soon as i started playing it i grinded this game on any free time i had for 2 weeks straight not playing any other game its hard but also not hard in a way. best souls game iv played so far. Graphics are amazing bosses are crazy cool and had me on a thrill ride the whole way. cant wait for the DLC expac

Can we have sekiro 2, great game btw
Amazing graphics, rich game play, and an engaging story line meant I clocked over 330 hours. And, it never got old. The story was written as well as you can expect the Tolkien franchise spin-off would be.  In other words, perfection.  Invest in some research before you start your character build and get ready for a wild ride. Five stars.
Yes
are you looking for a long grindy rpg with challenges to over come, cool weapons and beautiful yet power full spells somewhere where you can create a pvp build that makes most people wanna kill themselves well i can recommend elden ring! its the easiest of the souls games so its a great introduction the series

I hate the fire giant. I hate the fire giant. I hate the fire giant. I hate the fire giant.
cool
The play-styles vary enough to satisfy every kind of high-fantasy power trope you'd want to play as, and they range from making the game horseshit difficult to baby easy, so the game is accessible to all kinds of player. Even the ones who've never played a FromSoft game before- which was me. Its very good, play it.

Who the hell is on the fence about buying this game and reading a review?
Why does Niall have to summon his goons

I have no words except, git gud and enjoy!
One of the best games I've ever played easily a favorite.
yes
peak
good
I forced myself to beat DS1 and Sekiro, and after clearing most of this game, I can see why people talk up FromSoft games. But for me, these games are not worth the stress. Never again will I stress about delayed and qued player attacks. Never again will I stress about a boss baiting me into dodging with his attack animation only to have him strike just outside of that natural window. Never again will I stress about these wild ass boss attack combos that are this fucked up mix of fast and slow timings. Fuck soulslike as a genre, and good riddance.

We are the Elden Ring‚Ñ¢
Best Game on the market today and quite possibly Ever. True 10/10 experience.
I'm currently still playing through the game. This is technically my third time playing, though the first two times I didn't get very far whatsoever. 
Recently, with a lack of games to play, and hearing the news about Shadow of the Erdtree, I wanted to get back into Elden Ring, so instead I beat Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3. And just like that, I learned how souls games work. Now, that being said, you don't need to play any souls games before this, but keep in mind that this, like every other soulsborne title, is unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand even slightly. You are on your own in this world, and frankly, I like it that way.

This game feels like the culmination of Fromsoftware's work, melding together elements of Dark Souls with a beautiful new world, and a gigantic one at that. As of writing this, I am 75 hours into the game, and (as far as I am aware) am a little less than half way through it all. This game is massive, and the mistake I made the first two times I tried to play this game was rushing. Don't do that. Take your time, explore, appreciate every nook and cranny of the Lands Between, and trust me, there is a lot to see. This game is incredible, and playing it now for the third time after I managed to 'git gud', I can't put this game down. 

Day in and day out, all I can think about is Elden Ring, and it is a very special thing for any game to make me feel like that. 
This game isn't for everyone. There are points which will make you mad, and areas which can be painfully difficult if you're under equipped, and the game doesn't tell you anything. It is your adventure. Keep a notebook to keep track of quests, because there is no quest log, and place markers all over your map, because there are no objective markers. 

If you're in for a quick and simple fantasy RPG where you run from area to area slaying everything... This game isn't that. 
But if you're in for a long, hard-fought and rewarding adventure that you can lose yourself in, then yes, this game is the best of the best.


godskin duo is the best boss fight of all time in any game
If you are here. Download the game.
its so good i creamed my pants a little
I am Elden Lord and now I get maidens. Ive put some non stop hours into this game on console and replaying again on PC has only rekindled my love for it. This game is perfect but be warned, this game isn't really for casual players. IF you can get past dying over and over and over and over and over and over... and grinding for hours just to lose 6 levels worth of ruins, then this game is game is for you! The game is truly breath taking and has a well thought out lore. Not to mention, theres a dlc coming out soon for a game that released two years ago. So put that in your pipe and tell me how good the game is.

Best game I've ever played.
So far this game is pointless. The main plot directs you immediately to an impossible boss which seems to require leveling by grinding through slogs of the same mobs. Very little side quests or structured content is apparent. If you enjoy truly unguided wandering in a confusing landscape filled with extreme danger at every corner, this game is for you.  If you are looking for something rich with story, rewards, and meaning, play something else
What a great game. The combat, compared to other souls-likes, is improved greatly. You're given a huge, huge amount of choices and builds to choose and start from, and none of them are necessarily bad. Also, the open world is done really well. Right from the start, you're dumped into this big, open world with no one really holding your hand throughout the entire game. You can go anywhere you want, and you can also avoid any dangerous area you want and come back later.

Though Elden Ring is an amazing game, I also must say that this game is quite hefty. The requirements are quite demanding and the game does crash every so often. It also can be quite easy due to the amount of "broken" weapons and summons provided, however, without the "broken" weapons and summons, the game is quite hard. The enemies are pretty unique, and the bosses are all challenging, fun, and designed very well.
im stuck on maleniar
It's alright I guess
ranni is mommy
its been two years and the game still crashes whenever i unplug my controller or headset
im still maiden less.
she eld-on my ring till i tarnish
very hard

gooning
Very yes good game
ÊúüÂæÖDLC
My hours played says it all... 305hrs and still on first run and still really enjoying it. Open world is beautiful and animation and character designs top knotch.  Only downside is can't display ultrawide without running risk of getting flagged by anticheat. I have had difficulty keeping track of quests as it doesn't log for you. Was annoying at first but now its fun. I forget about things then find them again so spend all my time exploring rather than trying to do endless quests all at once. Combat is difficult and have been able to vary it a lot. Also almost forgot... All the souls games suck on keyboard and mouse but I have gotten used to controller now.
My 2nd full playthrough (1st was on PS5 - used summons/mimic)

Believe any and all hype. Makes other games look sparse. A real masterful culmination of all FromSoftware games. The amount of replay value and options available is insane. 

One of the best games ever made, simple as that really. PLAY IT!
its okay ig

i threw a large rock at the blue lady from the pringles gif, and she stopped my heart with her mind
its aight
I love this game
Dark Souls 2 Part 2 Redux Rebirth
its hell, but also super addicting. like drugs
good
Love this game :D
I remember watching YouTube videos of FightingCowboy, back when I was not able to afford even a decent PC. Love the game, is still the best to this date, and with the DLC coming out later this year, is the best thing ever!
I've never had a Souls-like game vibe with me before. The fact that this is open world and allows me to abandon boss fights if I wish and go take on other challenges to level up helps tremendously. The gameplay and trickery is still very difficult, but it's much more digestible in this format than the linear nature of Dark Souls.
Super engaging, im lucky to have found it
is good

malenia is so bad bro gotdamn
m√ºthi≈ü
DUMBEST LORE EVER!!! How people defend it is BEYOND ME!
People worship FINGERS in this game. Tell me that is not the STUPIDEST LORE EVER. NOT EVEN A WHOLE HAND, 
JUST 1-2 FINGERS. 
Maybe I just didn't "grasp" it... ü§£ü§£ü§£
It's just a hodge podge of everything with nothing actually good about it...
example: is Radagon a Dragon, man, woman or a shapeless blob??? Pick a lane???
Why is the Turtle a priest??? NO REASON. 

WORLD IS BLAND AND BORING IMO. 
HAVE NEVER CARED LESS ABOUT STORY IN MY LIFE. Good job G R.R. M

Pretty sure the Elden Ring Emblem came from the ring-stains of 
George R.R. Martin's Coffee Cup when he was writing the garbage story/lore to this game.

The lore in this game is the worst I've ever witnessed.
A 5 year old could maintain better plot than this. 
ALSO, the ending is BAD BAD BAD 
(5 second cinematic, after 100 hours of game??? How about 1-2 minutes for a WIND DOWN??? AWFUL DECISION)
awesome
Has given me both anger issues and a hard on
Perfection
good
eu acho que √© meio bom assim
out of every boss in the game, I died to the red wolf the most
good
So good.
Idk what to do in Elden Ring but it cool

melhor jogo melhor empresa melhor tudo ubisoft e uma merda sony e uma merda rockstar e uma merda mas e o goat segue intacto
Elden Ring, where do I start with this review, worth buying, to me no. I‚Äôm sorry, but I play games for fun, not to be a masochist for hours on end, such a painful experience. 

First and foremost, let's address the gameplay mechanics. While some may argue that mastering the game's mechanics is part of the experience, there's a fine line between challenging and frustrating. Elden Ring crosses that line with its clunky controls, which make no sense when it comes to modern-day controls. Rather than feeling like a test of skill, battles often devolve into an exercise in frustration, and leaving me frustrated.

The graphics, Elden Ring failed to impress me even on my powerful hardware. Despite playing in 4K, the visuals are underwhelming, with environments and character designs lacking the detail and polish expected from a modern title. Furthermore, the lack of support for ultra-wide screens only serves to exacerbate the issue. Not using my entire screen when even indie games manage to have this figured out, makes it quite a confusing choice.

It's baffling that in an era where seamless integration of controller support and intuitive UI design is standard, Elden Ring falls short in these areas. The on-screen prompts are cumbersome to navigate, reminiscent of a bygone era of gaming rather than a product of 2022. 

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a disappointment on multiple fronts. From its lacklustre gameplay mechanics to its subpar graphics and outdated UI design, it fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by people who talk about this game. While some may find enjoyment in the challenge it presents, for me, it will be remembered as a missed opportunity rather than a triumph of game design.

The hardest boss in this game is the buffering on rolling. Buffering means basically if you double tap something, it'll do it twice, which isn't a problem until you realize that when you get hit, if you spam dodge, you'll be forced to roll twice. I find it really bad, but just learn to dodge better, and you'll be fine. They only did so, so their game was harder. basically don't double tap dodge unless you wanna roll twice.
And when I say it's bad, I mean you can press it 0.1 milliseconds after you pressed it the first time and go all the way through with the first dodge. You'll end up dodging again after not pressing anything for one mississippi.

Pro's
It's got great art.
most bosses are awesome.
large world.
everything got me going ooo shiny.
so many builds you can do but this also might confuse people warning.


Con's
dragons you'll know not all dragons just the ones that like standing on walls and vanishing and reappearing where they started even though they're the ones that flew away.
Buffered dodging.
you should just run past every mob unless you want its weapon.


best game
Try finger, but hole
It is a good game, Once i started playing it, i got sucked into it because i had to complete it!  [b]BUT.......BUT...[/b]
The game lacks a lot of Quality of life tools. Also, Contrary to popular belief, though the world is rich and lore is deep. The actual story is aimless and lacking in quality. Very very disappointing ending. 

Overall i don't think its worth the time sink!
Real
Fun with friends
just f u c k i n g amazing
Hate it
I chose Ranni ending because I wanted seggs.

THIS GAME IS GREAT
My first Souls-like, it's amazing. Only problems are the reused bosses and the fact that a lot of the sidequests feel impossible to follow if you are not using a guide. Looking forward to the DLC.
My glorious pot overlord Alexander
try finger but hole
The game of the year indeed.
Perfect lore.
Not optimized well for pc.

ess goo goo
hell yes im on new game plus 4
I beat the game but still get killed by a pack of dogs
Borg smash
big sword smash good and fun. üëç
imagine skyrim but actually fun and interesting
One of the best games of all time
good game
a lovely game very easy. Melania boss is a straight up baddie.
Souls games speak for themselves as far as those who love to endure and win are concerned. Elden Ring is the dream of Skyrim that Todd Howard had dreamed. It also feels reminiscent of the witcher in terms of the open world play. 11/10
Great characters' design and open world. Amazing levelling up system and variety of weapons . overall a must play game.
Gud game is gud.

Great game overall
one of the best openworld i ever played
oh well... if one's pupils mention a game too often, one gets motivated to try it out, for how hard could it be if young ones are heaving fun with a game. And well, I love it! Even though my best friend in game is called "you died" :D
Played this a little bit, pretty fun.
Elden Ring is the newest installment from the company Fromsoftware and shares very similar tones with the previous Dark Souls 3 game. Using almost the same elements, the game will remind you vividly of DS3, that one being a bit further from the original Dark Souls 1, which made the ‚Äòsouls‚Äô genre so famous. Elden Ring requires a lot of expertise for its combat. It is a difficult game if you intend to play it alone without using the usually recognized "easy mode" like summoning players, npcs, or using the new ability ashes of war that allows you to call upon a creature to fight alongside you. And even with those facilitators, the game has a lot of difficulty spikes. Some will grant you great moments of conquest and others will simply make your veins pop in anger. The story has similar tones of vagueness and wonder all previous Fromsoftware games have. One will be enthralled by the mystic world and follow its clues checking items and searching for characters in this vast open world. Followed by a great soundtrack that can be enjoyed on its own, the game creates a fantastic atmosphere of wonder and wanderlust. While exploring you will face many different enemies that have many different ways of fighting. Some are simple, others require vast attention and reflexes, establishing the difficulty spikes previously mentioned. Akin to Dark Souls 3, I have found myself facing strange creatures that appear to not quite follow the rules of engagement. Some enemies have an impossible tracking. You can see by their models weirdly gyrating instead of actually moving their feet, as per example the runebears when they are to deliver their crashing hits. Others have this weirdly common act of delaying their attacks just to bait you into defending early. And some have the hysterical attacks that Dark Souls 3 was so fond of, flailing and screaming with endless stamina. This is quite a common trope in Elden Ring and gets tiresome quickly. That translates into many moments of frustration that may enrage you. Those cheap gimmicks in combat being the only perceivable crass flaw in the game, while everything else is composed of fantastic elements that produce a fantastic experience. As someone that enjoys acquiring achievements, this installment allowing you to near complete it in one go also deserves my personal praise. After having to go through DS3 multiple times for its damned rings, I never again want to be forced to NG+ in order to properly complete a game. Elden Ring is definitely a recommended game for the fans of the action rpg genre. It is not perfect, but it has great value, great mechanics, great characters and an incredible story.

amasing game,as always comming from FROM SOFTWERE
peak
best game I've ever played
not hard at all
Good.
so good. though some bosses towards the end are not very good. but its still very good. actually no, they are still amazing. after having played ds 1 and some of ds 2 i can confirm that elden rings bosses are amazing stop lying morons. Honestly Godskin duo is better than Ornstein and Smough. im not joking. Elden ring is good so buy it and dont give up. i swear to god if you give up and say its trash just because you have been running around not doing anythint im gonna lose it.
Big fun time
yelp

om abdo
ngl, the crucible knights are still the hardest bosses in the game
Dog
it runs well on steam deck locked at 40/40. I have about 500 hours on ps5 but got it on steam to play with more friends and it's still just as fun
(:
amazing game solo. breathtaking scenery. the combat is the epitome of dark souls, polished with the addition of refined magic and sorcery that are visually stunning. download the coop mod and i can kill bosses and bad people of all forms and species with the ultimate goal of becoming the elden lord with my girlfriend.

Behold Elden Ring.
This re-did open world for me and this is how open world ought to be. The world should not merely complement the missions where traversal is simply the means to reach the objective, as in every open world game. No. The world ought to be alive in itself and it should urge players to explore every nook and cranny granting rewards (in ER - weapons, spells, incantations, secrets, etc.) for the effort. Moreover, barely anything that you think you could climb or reach is off limits. This is why the open world in this game blew me away. 

Other than that, pure pain and suffering for us masochists :')
This game open world its insane!!
i can't wait Shadow Of The Erdtree

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.
It's a very imersive game... if you beggin you won't know when to stop
ITs sooooooood gooood
Perfect
w
I`m really like the complexity, which provided by this game.
PRAISE THE SUN
sucks

its good
addictive game ahead, try outside
jg
Fun:)
Really? If you've played any other Fromsoft souls-like title you have to play this one, if you haven't this is probably the most accessible one in the catalog so what are you waiting for, the lands between aren't going to save themselves, get in there tarnished.
sword
Try Finger...
But hole
Recommend
100h+ into the game to get all achievements and still maidenless... well at least I'm the Elden Lord now.
so awesome sauce
Absolutely amazing game! It looks beautiful even on the low graphics I need to use to handle the game on my PC, the lore is nothing short of amazing and inspires me (as a writer wannabe) and the gameplay is very satisfying..provided you can get over the fact you may die many..many..MANY times to learn, as per usual with Souls-like games. Go out there and become Elden Lord, Tarnished!
the most game money can buy
The Game is just absolutely fantastic! I recommend everyone to play this especially if you are into the Soulslike Genre of Gaming. Even If not the game is made SUPER accessible to newcomers to the franchise. Yes, The Game Is Difficult and will seem TOO difficult Near the beginning of your playthrough but thats kind of the point the entire game and even the dark souls games are all about overcoming the challenge. there is no handholding whatsoever . They kick you straight into the world and you are fully free to do whatever you want and fight whoever you want.
Typical dark souls recipe, but a super fun game! I'm going on 400 hours of play time of Elden Ring between PS5 and PC and I still haven't burned out. The insane amount of builds to try and play along with the meta pvp brackets i could log another 400 hours easily.
fan game, enjoyed getting 2 shotted by the bullsh!t golem watch dogs with their spamming ground pound attack. would recommend
FIX THE FKING GLINTSTONE PEBBLE IN PVP THAT SHIT IS NOT HITTING THERE FOR I SHOULD NOT BE TAKING DAMAGE
Game has it all, a hot lady with a sword, a hot doll with 4 arms, a hot guy with a lion, a little rat man that tailors your clothes, a boywife and his non-consentual half-brother husband and a dude that's just a big snake who also has a sword.

I have just started my second character and I still have areas unexplored before the DLC. Elden Ring is really the game that keeps on giving. It is initially a difficult learning curve - but in reality, once you upgrade your weapon of choice a few times, get some of those golden seeds in ya, it becomes more forgiving. Patience rewards you too. It's better to hang back and let the enemy attack first so you can learn their move set and find the gaps to attack, and don't be too greedy about it. You will be punished for trying to land a 10 hit combo.

2/10
Good Game
Level vigor, try different strategies, do your research if you aren't having success. If you're confused as to what the hell is happening, check out Vaatividya on youtube. 

Best art design of a game, maybe ever. Lovely and awe inspiring, huge depth.
Haven't finished the game yet but easily is my new favorite game of all time - immensely peak.
good.
Very good, very fun. Difficult as expected of FromSoftware games, but I would rate it second best game of theirs after the original Dark Souls.
one of the best....

Recommended!
get it
Pain.
Very good game
One of the best games of all time!
My dad is 55, and I think he might be one of the oldest people playing this game. I got it for Christmas in 2021 from my uncle, and I was hooked from the start. Within a week, I had logged 24 hours on it. But I could tell it bothered my dad. He's a single father, and it's always been tough finding things to do together since Mom passed away. Then, one day, he surprised me by making his own Steam account and joining me in the game. At first, he was a bit lost, not knowing what to do, but when he asked me for help and we started playing together, it was like a whole new world opened up. It's become our thing now. Playing this game together has brought us closer than ever. We still hang out outside and do stuff, but now we have this special bond over the game. It's amazing how something as simple as a video game can bring so much joy and create so many memories.
AMAZING BOSSES
Great game

Great game, good first intro to a Souls game. You feel the hours slip as you find your way around the map, as you grind runes, as you repeatable try to kill a boss over and over. This game will ruin your life.
9.8/10
Beautiful world. Difficult encounters. Lots of customization and things to do. Has a DLC as well.

I've played this game so many times. I have recently just switched to pc so I am playing it again to get ready for the dlc. It runs so smooth.
pretty cool
try fingers, but hole...
moist...
im gonna die
Never played any Dark Souls games, but this game takes the cake in novelty of environments and lore. Both highly detailed and interesting. Learning how to play was a bit of a challenge, but it made the experience better imo. Highly recommend to anyone willing to throw hours into a game.
they have so much shit to nerf, and so much else to make harder

it's like they didn't play their own damn game
I previously played Elden Ring on PS5 when it first launched and then didn't play it again until recently on PC. Even though it was my second time, the game gave me the same sense of exploration, discovery, and fulfillment it did when I played it for the very first time. 

The combat animation and mechanics are among the best with an extensive range of weapons and weapon types. Each weapon type has a variety of different permutations and unique animations. On top of this, the weapons can be further enhanced through different skills, affinities, and dual wields. There is also a broad library of magic that is just as vital to the gameplay as the melee and together they can weave an utterly satisfying combat experience. 

The game repeatedly blew me away in its exceptional level design and sheer breadth. The open world begs to be explored as you truly never know what you may find. You're challenged to think logically in various situations as your dwindling ability to heal, the enemy's intensity, and increasing amount of runes you're carrying work together to create an addicting tension that can be punishing.

I distinctly remember being shocked when I inadvertently discovered an entirely new region I didn't even know existed and this happened repeatedly. I remember the satisfaction of learning enemy movesets and using the knowledge of numerous deaths to finally defeat a challenging boss. Elden Ring is among one of the best games I've played--it is truly an experience--and I'm genuinely excited for Shadow of the Erdtree.

No point in this game. How the heck is it rated so highly?
it's cool

Hands down the best game of the past few years, by far not the easiest but it still gives goosebumps with the cutscenes.
first quadruple A game
It's a good game. Nuff said.
yes

Simply a gem.
Huge fan of the souls series and I'm biased as you can get but this is greatest game of all time objectively. Pick this game up and use a guide for your character build and progression. You're going to have a blast and you'll be a better person because of it.
best game???
mhm
The real elden ring was the friends we made along the way
cool swords and other stuff
I waited until after I had beaten the game before I left a review. This was my first full playthrough of a FromSoftware game and without over exaggerating, this game changed me for the better. It taught me that persistence and an unbreakable will can get you through most challenges this game has to bring. It gave me a rich story and world to explore with detail found in every corner that most open world games will never have. It showed me how to appreciate the design of each of the bosses and see the art in every encounter. I'm glad that this was my first Fromsoft experience but I can say definitively that this will not be my last. I have found a new genre of games that I truly love and look forward to experiencing.

it gud
this game fucking sucks

fort,
night?
I wish I could list the recommendation as "No (for players that have the same taste as me)".  There wasn't a feeling of progression and getting stronger from gaining levels and upgrading equipment. The game felt very random, unguided and left a ton of things unexplained (could not imagine playing this without looking stuff up on the internet).
The game is awesome! For every new player to souls like games remember the game is hard but fair!

i got so frustrated fighting a boss and dying over and over that i got up and deep cleaned my entire room after i had been for weeks putting it off. since then, my lifestyle has changed. my heart is weaker from stress but at least my mental is better because my surroundings are cleaner.
ziggy approved video game
one of the best, although too open world for me. I'm more into Dark Souls map progression systems.
greatest game ever
Git Gud before playing
Maidenless
This game is bloody awesome
subterranean shunning grounds
Is epic, kinda hard tho ngl
its fun, as my first souls game this got addicting to play quickly of course do ur research before buying since its not for everyone
I mean you all know this game is good
If you are reading this chances are you already know this game is one of the best. I think this is the best game of this genre i will ever play. I love everything from the graphics to the open world, and even if you feel lost or don't know what to do or how to progress at times it is literally because there is SO MUCH to do (most of it is optional u can finish this game really quickly if u want)

Hard but fair (except the gang boss fights, we need more of them actually designed as multiple bosses instead of two single bosses), amazing visuals, and extremely high build variety, seriously, a wretch can go from a knight to a samurai to a mage to a jack of all trades using respec with so many unique weapons and spells, etc.

Great game, a bit over priced and wished it went on sale more. but I would definitely replay this game 100 times
there isnt a word that can describe the misery this game has put me through i swear malenia is the worst boss in existance 10/10 would recommend
First Souls like game ever played and loved it.
Died a lot but found hope in many dogs and BONK
Good game, thank you Michael Zaki.
Sometimes, all you want is to relax and have fun while playing a game. Unfortunately, Elden Ring is not very friendly towards non-professional players as it lacks the option to adjust game difficulty. Each time you die, you're forced to fight through a long path again to challenge the boss. This repetitive cycle becomes exhausting and frustrating, particularly when you spend hours trying but keep getting defeated. It's not the type of gameplay I was looking for, as I prefer an experience that doesn't feel masochistic.
Most everyone has heard of this game so i doubt i need to say much.

It's a great game, lots of lore and lots of fun.


jhnob
This game does everything that every other Souls title does, but worse. 

Instead of a linear progression through intricate levels with secret paths and fun but hard enemies, we have a massive and overwhelming open world that is filled with so much nothing. between point A and point B, you will find some boring low level mobs, maybe some souls or whatever, and a walking mausoleum here and there. The only people this helps are the people who can't play games unless there's an open world involved. To me, this cheapens their incredible linear design throughout the rest of the game, in places such as the Academy.
Not to mention the fact that there is, seemingly, no order at all to which you can tackle the bosses and other things on the map. This is good for the freedom that the open world offers, but it leads to incredible confusion and a feeling of being overwhelmed. There is a fairly obvious path that they want you to start with, but if you want to explore you will suffer until you head down said path and start to level. 
So...... what exactly is the point of the open world? to lure you into a false sense that there is lots of content in this game. As of writing this review, i have about 50 hours in the game. I have fought so many "bosses" in these throwaway corner-of-the-area dungeons (the ones that usually have a blue trail pointing towards them) that are nothing but more powerful versions of the mobs they spread across this benign world map. How the hell can you actually call that content? all you did was make them bigger and give them a couple extra moves + hp. i can't even safely say i have completed half of this game, as my time is split across multiple characters, but i can confidently say that probably half of what i have done has already been copied and pasted somewhere else in the world.

please for the love of everything, fix the NPC questlines. im so tired of having to look up how to progress NPC arcs. the cryptic dialogue they give is not fun or interesting, and how am i supposed to know what does and doesn't screw up a questline? i kill one boss on the opposite side of the map from someone and now they're gone. incredible. Nobody thinks that's fun.

it boggles my mind that this has a better reception than any other souls game, and the only reason is because it's open world. it's "more accessible" in this design than other souls titles, but it does not feel the same, or nearly as good.

I have tried again and again to enjoy this game, but it's missing something that the other titles have. I really can't put my finger on it, so i simply listed problems i have with the game as a whole.
Fun game
Great Game! Big Souls fan so the length and content available, including the return of some previous NPC's is amazing. 138 hours in and only just started Journey 2. Fair to say im getting my monies worth.
Beautiful Open World and a huge training area to git gud.
Very good game

Pain is REAL !
GOATED
Best Dark Souls so far. The freedom to explore and collect everything you need for your build before you have to do any main story bosses is my favorite part. You are only weak or helpless if you choose to be.
kys

This is the exact game I've been hoping for for almost 10 years. Fromsoftware combat with a vast open world like skyrim. Beautiful locations to explore, awesome bossfights that take time to learn, loads of awesome weapons to use. Feels like the perfect spiritual successor to Dark Souls. Some people complain that bosses are reused too much, or that side dungeons get repetitive, but I didn't have much of an issue with that. Even if I did all of that is optional anyway. This game is a dream come true for me. 9.8/10
very nice graphic and very nice  game a lot of thing to do
I love this game... and also I hate it. 99.5 hours in... and I still suck.
5* love this game
one of, if not the greatest game ever made and that's not an exaggeration.  From level design to enemy variety to scenery, its all done insanely close to perfectly,  If you somehow haven't played you have to.
good indie souls-like, nails the fromsoft vibe

Great game for casual play, with satisfying victories, and enough alternate quests and places to explore that you never need to be caught up against a brick wall. Pairs well with an edible or a glass of whiskey, and a browser opened to the game's wiki.

If Elden Ring has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Elden Ring has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Elden Ring has only one fan then that is me. If Elden Ring has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Elden Ring, then I am against the world.

Still no dogs I can pet but Radann is so fucking cool I'm revising my negative review to a positive one
Game of the year
STR build or bust.
Unforgiving difficulty,  so addictive.   Old school game mindset.   I came back and revisited the game again with the DLC announcement, it was like starting fresh all over again since I had forgotten so much.
the best game in the world
Malenia,Godfrey,morgot or mohg are all really great boss... but nothing can beat MALIKETH, THE BLACK BLADE. Reason? He's literally death.
One of the worst games I have ever played. I dont understand all of the other positive reviews. Its mind blowing actually.

No story
No instructions
No purpose

Its just running around and exploring different areas and fighting really difficult/challenging enemies while trying to grind to level up your gear.

Legit trash game even after playing with mods. Goodbye forever Elden Trash. Never again!


is good elden and ring

Very cool
amazing game , open world and allows you to just explore without comitement to bosses  to be able to roam free which i love. so many possibilities in terms of builds and combinations , overall great game to play alone or with friends
My favorite of Fromsoft's titles and one of my favorite games ever.
This is the best game I have played in a LONG time. This is my first ever souls game, and I wish I could experience it all over again. It's a beautiful game, with amazing combat elements and graphics beyond what my computer thought it could handle. It makes all triple A games look like garbage from the last couple years. The price could be tripled and I would buy it. This game is a masterpiece to behold for all game developers to look up to. With the DLC coming I cannot wait to jump back into it to 100% it all over again with the added content. Overall, 15/10.
Hell yeah
I touched a woman.
malenia isn't unfair and radahn didn't need a nerf. 11/10 sick game
Upon his name as Godfrey, the first Elden Lord
Elden Ring, depending on my mood, is my favourite game of all time. It is a game that tells you to overcome all your challenges with a little learning and persistence.. in game, not out of game. As of writing this review, it might seem I haven't played too much, but I have 100% the game on xbox, and have gotten decently far on PC, and of course in time, I do plan on 100% it again. The reason I say this is because It'd be kind of weird to write a review like this from someone who appears to have not even beat the game yet.

The gameplay is pretty daunting at first. Souls games are infamous for being hard, and first time players of the game probably worry they might drop the game early because they can't get past an enemy/boss. If we were talking about the other souls games, I'd understand, but with how Elden Ring's world is built, you can just turn around and go somewhere else, level up, and kick that enemy's buttocks. The game is super flexible, and very welcoming to new comers in that regard. And after levelling up a bit, finding some gear and spells, the combat looks like a battle straight out of a cut scene. Getting used to boss attacks can be challenging of course, but super rewarding in the end, even if you levelled up to the point you can just beat them in ten hits.

The world is beautiful. Some people criticised the game after it won game of the year, claiming that it looks like a mobile game, but one good look at the trailer alone kind of throws that argument out the window. Every location, be it a flat plains, a hellish landscape, the snowy peaks of the mountains, or even underground (especially underground), all looks like a fantasy world you can easily get lost in. Each areas design and structure is out of this world, and should probably have an art museum open up somewhere for this single game alone. The game also doesn't tell you where you go to get to your next mission, at least not with a marker, fast travel points on the map, if close enough to a point of interest involving progression in the story, will point toward the next site of grace (fast travel point) that you need to go to, and you just follow the trail.

The story is something that's a little harder to explain, as in most games, it's pretty straight forward, whereas in this game, the best way to say it is it's not spoon fed to you. It is easy to pick up a general idea of the story so long as your brain isn't turned off whilst you're playing. You are sent to the land to become the elden lord, and in order to do that, you need to gather the pieces of the elden ring, from the main bosses in the game. These bosses are not random high health people, they do have a past, and a story, but again, the game isn't going to spoon feed you that. Technically the story happened over a thousand years ago or something, so you could say that you play the character who is introduced at the end of the book, who has taken up the mantle of ending the story. Your story in this game is simple, but it's built upon a very rich lore, that I believe was written by George R. R. Martin, the guy who wrote the Game of Thrones books. 

Side quests are not required, but if you do somehow find where to go next, they tell a pretty nice story, and sometimes even tell some sweet sweet lore to the world. some side missions are missable though, or you might just miss a part of a side mission and pick it up later in the side missions story. If you don't want to do the side missions, that fine, however, there is one side mission I highly suggest, It is the Ranni the Witch questline. You could technically argue it's main story, as it is connected to one of the bosses holing and elden ring, and doing this side mission unlocks an ending involving Ranni, however, it is labelled a side mission in the official guide, and is missable. Look it up if you hate how the side missions are structured (they don't tell you where to go to continue said story, how people have completed EVERY single side mission in one game, I don't know).

As a side note, if you're still worried you might drop the game, don't be afraid to use the internet or something. Look up where to find gear, where to level up best, How to upgrade your weapon, or look at specific side missions, and how to get to the next part of it. Some might say it's cheating to use the internet, but guide books have existed since before such easy internet reliability, and they're pretty much the same thing, but one is free... though on that note, there is a pretty cool official guide you can get for the game, that looks nice, and is pretty helpful with all the things I mentioned not being afraid of looking up online.

It's alright
Simply goated
.
never played a souls game this game was hard and rewarding i absolutly love this game now
I like the jump button.
it good
simple. games goated.

smellden ring
if you cant beat this game in 0.0s idk what ur doing
Never did I tread the paths of Souls ere (merely Sekiro for ten brief hours), venturing without grand hopes. Though I fare poorly against formidable foes, the wanderlust within me thrives. Lo and behold, the realm of Elden Ring unveiled myriad wonders. A realm of splendor, lore profound, an indelible journey. Tenfold, I rate this saga.
it's like a western
good game
Elden ring is a fantastic game in most ways.  Exploring this vast world is hugely entertaining, challenging, and sometimes frustrating.  This is a great addition to the fromsoft library.   It can sometimes suffer for its scope though.  Compared to other modern fromsoft games the mild philosophy of quantity over quality is noticeable as a fromsoft fan.  Some of the encounters (Especially the flying kind) are comparatively half baked and should have been thought out/playtested more.   Dont get me wrong, I love this game.  We just need to acknowledge its flaws as well as its strengths.
YAAAAAAASS QUEEEEEN
It is a really hard game but you will eveuntually get used to it, althogh it will take a while.
My buddy on steam ZoogieBoy thinks these types of games are to hard so he's missing on out on one of the best games ever!

Recommend this if you think he's good enough!
Goofy ahh


its pretty good
¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨
update i was lying the first time i dont like it
like a darks soul game pretty hard but u will get the hang of it
nice

Nice game, my first soulslike game
Millie my beloved
its elden ring
I just want to begin by saying that there is no shame in using a guide to help you play through this game. There are plot points you may miss if you are not a meticulous person who goes and talks to every person they can, and also after every little event that happens. I say this because this game, as well as other souls games, thrive on you looking into things. reading item descriptions, checking every corner, and talking to everyone. It may seem tedious, but i can assure you that if you just play the game to hack and slash or sling spells (which is fun), you're going to miss some of, if not the best, lore you have ever been blessed with. This game is worth giving your time and patience to. Miyazaki, and Martin are not amatuers when it comes to lore. And the know how to hide it, and place it for you to go searching. And if you think it, or any other souls game is too hard, just remember this. The game isn't decide to beat you down or make you quit. It is designed to force you to get better, and overcome while never giving up. Don't go hollow.
Game of the century.
why is it always death
Awesome would recommend for anyone who is looking for a story open world game that has really good combat and hard fights with lots of different endings and lots of weapons to choose from with cool abilities to master.
yes
Praise the Lord
so amazing finished it on ps5 and got it on pc because its that good
I have PTSD every time I see a Gargoyle now
fantastic world building
still better than bloodborne
This game has made me the most upset out of any other game I've played. Possibly the worst experience I've ever had gaming, and ever will have. Not only has this ruined my past, it has ruined my present and future as well.

10/10
The best game of 2022.
69 hours in beat rotussy tbh idk why people said soul games are hard 
didnt even use mimic SMH
shit is simply fire

you can make every enemy malenia with mods
Seek maidens
REALLY GOOD SOULSLIKE GAME.
I finished the games 3 times already but I don't think I'll play it again. That's because the game is enjoyable but also frustrating. I cannot help but overlook the crucial flaws that the game has. I'll list them below - 

1. The game doesn't value your time. You have to do tedious farming over and over again to level up or otherwise the enemies and bosses will kick your behind. 

2. Some key bosses like Maliketh and mogh (2nd phase), Malenia (Optional boss) required if you want complete experience, Commander Nial (Required to reach Malenia) are completely absurd because of their mechanics and how poorly their mechanics are designed just to make the game frustrating. All of them have very small attack windows, Infinite stamina and op damage output. Malenia has lifesteal that also makes it too difficult to tank as well. Even with mimic tear these fights are absurd. Sekiro(another from software game) didn't have these issues at all. Sekiro was difficult but it felt fair. The mechanics were fair.

3. The Lack of navigation and direction of side quests and key elements( Like the locations of 2 dectus medallions, 2 haligtree medallions especially the one in albeuranics on the pot guy) are crazy bad. And I don't agree that this is a part of the exploration but rather it is a cheap marketing tactic used by the developers to force you to use the internet and youtube so that the game appears everywhere and reaches more audiences and sells more.

4. The world is simply hostile. Everything tries to kill you just like any other souls game. It gets very irritating sometimes especially when you are trying to explore or walk to a quest or boss. Even the side quest characters tries to kill you at the end ( Like Alexander jar, varre, millicent simply dies or you can kill her, Irina's father Edgar invades you at some point god knows why, Bernhal invades you in farum azula without any dialogue which was really strange as he just spit knowledge during volcano manor quest, Sellen meets a tragic ending no matter what you choose ). It just felt unnecessary as if fromsoftware doesn't know how to end the side quests on a good note. Not even one. 

At the end of the day I won't recommend the game to anyone because although I enjoyed the experience the amount of struggle and frustration overshadows it. To be honest screw fromsoftware games for making these masochistic games only because Myazaki likes to jerk off while playing his punishing games. He is actually a masochist look it up, thats why the games are so miserable. They create this beautiful fantasy world and write these amazing npc's and backstory but they won't let us enjoy it all without the misery. This is why fromsoftware games will never be as good as games like Witcher 3, Rdr2, Gta 4. And I finished every fromsoftware game except bloodborne. Game should be a source of entertainment not frustration or misery and Myazaki needs to finally understand that not everyone is a sick masochistic bastard like him.

overrated af with copy pasted enemies AND bosses.
i broke my wall punched thru a monitor and destroyed a controler 
i love this game
i personally don't see how a game designed for you to feel failure can be enjoying and this is why i don't recommend this game for people who have low self esteem ,



any tips for Soldier of Godric i need help

its very fun but hard
greatest game of all time

The most aesthetically pleasing game ive ever played

Primarily played this on PS5 but this shit is untouchable
This is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. Hands down an amazing experience worth hundreds of hours.
best videogame of all time
this game stinks
good
i think i could play this game 12 more times and still not be bored idk what they put in this
games is good and i like it but its eazy if u dont follow the main path
Really Fun
One of the greatest achievements in gaming. Play it
try finger but hole
THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED 
a great story and lore
a great gameplay
a great graphics 
a great visuals
a great VA
idk if i missed anything (ofc i did)  but its a literal perfection for a game
it worth every single penny i paid. 
im really looking up for the DLC
It's alright.
The controls are horrible. I need 5 seconds to select a healing potion for example, because you can only scroll in one direction, which is a problem when I overscoll, and with the default controller layout I cant even move whilst selecting, which is really frustrating.
I am bad, I am slow and I dont understand what I have to do.

But this game is so beautifull. There are moments I just look around and enjoy the view. And then die bc I didnt see that thingie on the horse coming. ;)

The first boss I killed was a moment of absolute joy. I hope there will more to come.

I dont think I will ever get to the Elden ring, but I dont care. I just play for the fun of it.
yes
amazing
Very fun
this is my first dark souls game and ITS VERY DIFFICULT i am currently trying to level up to beat godrick. and 9hrs in i really enjoy this game besides the rage lol
Bloodborne 2 is alright.
good

Little bit more fun than minesweeper.
Best game ever.

This is my second purchase of elden ring, I bought it once for ps5 beat it, came back for more. I will be Elden Lord!

it good
First ever dark souls game I've played, game teaches you about skill issue. Having so much fun learning so far
A benchmark game for open world RPG's. The art direction is amazing, and everything about this game is just top notch work.
good shit
w rizzler
Is an impressive game with a lot of effort in it, the map makes want to explore it, and the dark fantasy enviroment gives the soul-like experience.
The combat is the same as ever but with some additions like the jump and crouch that is not a lot but makes the gameplay a little different.
Is a long game but is worth every single minute you spend on it.
10/10, contender for my favorite game ever
Quando voc√™ se estressar tentando passar dos bosses se acalme programando em java, √© menos estressante
My Favorite game of the last 5 years, ive got about 1000 hours on ps4 from challenge runs and pvp, but decided to get a copy on my shitty laptop to play at college. It runs like a potato and at 50 fps, but despite that im still having a great time, not excited for the final bosses with a fourth of second of input lag tho lol.
za besto
just play it and feel it
I never played much soulslike games before, but this is the best soulslike game I ever played for sure! Recommended! 

Pros:
- Graphics are awesome. Game runs smooth on my older PC.
- Game is creative and fun all the way to the final boss. It never feels repetitive in a boring way.
- So many enemies, bosses, quests and items! Awesome!
- A lot of different class/styles to play.
- Game has lots of mods and I really recommend the seamless co-op mod!
- You can play the game on hard or normal, its up to you to explore and use the tools the game gives you.
- Controllers and animations feel really good and responsive.
- Crafting is not too complex, and its easy to upgrade weapons and spells.
- The world makes me wanna explore everything, which is great! They really made the right choice making this an Open World game.
- All in all a masterpiece game! 10/10

Cons:
None in my opinion. But if I had to write something it would be:
- Devs should have added something like the seamless co-op mod as a native feature for co op PvE adventure.
- I never liked anticheat stuff like EAC for games where you play solo or co op PvE, so they should have added a native toggle feature for this so players can choose themselves. Luckily there are mods that fixes these things, so its not a big issue :)
oh elden ring, i really dont know what to say. countless hours of dying and hating my life in this game. but ill tell you one thing, the wins were so worth it. there were times where i spent days trying to fight the same boss just to keep getting absolutely demolished again and again. but besides all of that, the game is astounding with its amazing mechanics and gorgeous artwork, an absolute masterpiece that deserved game of the year! currently still trying to beat the elden beast so can finally be done with it until the dlc comes out. but overall this game is just a 10/10.
10/10 pog
If this game was a cock I would suck it
Difficult game but the more you play the more it makes sense. Don't switch your weapon too often and get a feel for how you move and things start making more sense. Also word of advice to anyone who might see this - rolling into the bosses instead of away from them can make a big difference.
The Elden truly did Ring -Elden John Ring
Top Ten game of all time.
Open world soulslike, do you need more?!
Amazing game, looking forward to the DLC.
Very nice
One of the few games I actually finished while enjoying every minute of it :)
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
Its elden ring... come on ... Play it ! its good !! c'est malade !!!
The game is worth the price, and the price is a chunk of your life and a chunk of sanity. Still worth it. DS3 still has better bosses tho.
A fun RPG game that is pretty much Zelda games 10 times better.
mi paciencia se fue con este juego, pero matar√≠a por volver a tener la experiencia de descubrir todo por primera vez
Great game, but seriously unplayable with constant occurring frame stuttering and freezes on PC. In a game that is so punishing and requires perfect execution of combat actions, this performance on PC ruins the experience.
fun, very fun sometimes very rage inducing, but fun
Bought this game three times, 2 for myself and once for a friend, and then bought DLC on top, and thinking to buy DLC for my friend as well.

Good game.
beautiful, amazing, one of the best games I've played
Don't need me to tell you what you already know. It's frankly a fantastic game, and even some shitter like me can figure out a fun build.

Good game
There's this absurd feeling in the oldschool roguelikes I've played that comes from being able to smash everything together. Selections from world mythology, fantasy epics, and decades of monster manuals can be packaged in ASCII art and delivered like they all belong side by side in a dungeon. This bliss feels, frankly, unadaptable. EXCEPT!! FromSoft executes it perfectly, aboveground and in more loving detail than anyone else out there. Of course the sorcerers are friends with the crystal aliens

big fun
i am an elden lord x15
My first souls-like that I managed to play for more than an hour or two without rage-quitting. It is hard for sure, but man, this game really does live up to the hype. Took me 1.5 years of owning it to finally get committed to a run, and now I am well and truly hooked on this game, and so excited for the fact that I have Sekiro, Bloodbourne, Dark Souls and Demon Souls to give a try now that I "get it".  The world is the most beautiful world I have ever seen in a game. The combat is tight. Enemies are punishing. I died to Margit probably 50x, maybe more, but Godrick only took maybe 5-10x! And there are TONS of smaller bosses to take on too. So many castles and dungeons and caves to explore. So many items/weapons/armour to try out. Various builds to play with too. The value for your money is simply unmatched with this game.

Can't wait for the DLC in June, I should be done my first run by the time it drops.

Man, what a game..!
game play
its good and we all know its good, nothing i say here will be impactful because anyone reading this already knows elden ring and how good it is

Couldn't get into it at first because was expecting it to be "Dark souls 4" when it first released ,but it is for sure not that. Once I took a break from it and came back to it years later with a fresh pair of eyes and zero expectations I love this game now. For me this almost feels like from software applying all of their greatest mechanics into one game. Coming back to this it is scratching so many itches for me I never realized I had. 10/10 I can see myself doing more than one play through and playing this for years to come. Late to the party, but I am pretty excited for Shadow of the Erdtree.
very good game cant wait for the dlc
Never realised how awful I was at video games until now
I get the hype and am happy that so many people have such a great time with the game. Sadly, it doesn't capture me like Dark Souls 3 did. The open world gives me way too many ways to evade enemies, grind for loot or runes and come back to bosses when I'm way to strong. Yes, this is a problem on my end. But I'd like it more, if the incentive to kill the bosses would be more than my own motivation because I don't have a lot of that. Also the story and worldbuilding doesn't do it for me. Great game, just not for me. I'll recommend it anyways.
excellent
Good challenge
you might have to get good ;)
Perfection
i lovw
10/10 would punch god again
super good rannis feet are awesome

the most expansive, immersive fantasy game to date
Game is unique, very nice graphics, feeling, atmosphere, unique environments and fights with some interesting stories.

CONS:

Firstly  you can literally miss pivotal things of the game play , i literally had no idea how to level ... had to google it cause i missed what seemed to developers some obvious landmark . but that is basically the number one rule of the game ... google things .. and google some more ... where are the mushrooms ... how can i beat something or where can i find it .. where is that staff or some other thing ...  ( i literally missed the tutorial cause i didn't jump, missed map marks , missed so many things , that i either in the end googled or saw in some videos )

Second ... items are rare and far between , the starting mage robe .. like the one you start with, seems to be the best.. had to google it multiple times cause i could not believe that in a game with so many interesting creatures and scenery i am stuck looking the same ... for the whole 100 hours i played it .. i had the SAME robe .... 

Thirdly .... i understand the whole dark souls thing about making it hard to kill bosses ... or maybe i am a bad player :) true ... but i literally had to be lvl 90 to beat a boss for which the community was recommending lvl 50-55 ... they give you the possibility to skip most of them , so that is nice :) ( i got to experiment more of the world because of that ) , but in the end i got stuck on some bosses and i literally have to walk aimlessly and kill the highest experience  giving critters on the map just for level ... more levels more stats and maybe i can beat them when i'm lvl 2000 :)

Lastly ... the side quests are very rare , nice stories , rare , and again a lot of googling to see how you can finish it :) or continue it. Also one key or mouse click and you kill the NPC that unlocks whole new area of the map :) ... 

I played 100 hours , enjoyed 50 :) so is good value i guess.
I cannot recommend it as i am left bitter tasting having to delete the game without finishing it .. can't roam same lands for XP and try the same bosses over and over again forever.
The best game in the last 5 years
(The PC port is kinda ass and stutters a lot)
Seigward's absence in "Elden Ring" has disappointed many fans, including myself. The character, known for his memorable encounters and distinct personality in "Dark Souls III," contributed to the unique atmosphere of the game. His absence in "Elden Ring" is indeed a loss for the series, as players will miss the opportunity to interact with this beloved character once again.

The absence of Seigward in "Elden Ring" is particularly striking due to the impact he had on the narrative and gameplay of "Dark Souls III." His questline, which culminated in a poignant and memorable encounter, added depth to the game world and resonated with many players. The absence of such a well-crafted character in "Elden Ring" is a notable omission that has left fans feeling a sense of loss.

On a different note, the comparison of Alexander the Great to a "terrible ripoff" is a bold statement that warrants further exploration. Alexander the Great, known for his military prowess and conquests, has been a figure of historical significance for centuries. His impact on the ancient world, particularly in the realm of warfare and empire-building, is undeniable. However, it is important to acknowledge that historical figures are often subject to varying interpretations and perspectives.

While some may view Alexander the Great as a symbol of conquest and expansion, others may critique the methods and consequences of his actions. The notion of a "terrible ripoff" suggests a strong disapproval of Alexander the Great's legacy. It is crucial to consider the diverse historical, cultural, and academic perspectives that shape our understanding of figures such as Alexander the Great.

In conclusion, the absence of Seigward in "Elden Ring" has elicited disappointment among fans, reflecting the impact of well-crafted characters on the gaming experience. Furthermore, the characterization of Alexander the Great as a "terrible ripoff" invites critical examination of historical figures and the varying perspectives that shape their legacies. These observations highlight the nuanced nature of storytelling, historical interpretation, and the impact of beloved characters in the gaming world.
Got the Physical Special Edition, thinking it was something like Skyrim. It's pretty bad, and practically unplayable without mods.

Get this game bruh
I stack no runes and get no maidens but this game helps me forget that fact

A very good game with beautiful visuals and a great story that everyone should definitely experience
Best thing that ever happened to be during the quarantine.

Thx for curing my ED in video games!

yes i fcked tree sentinel after 6 hours, recommend for masochists(and he fcked me back for the rest of the time)
Unpopular opinion here but I find the open world bland, empty and boring as compared to DS3 and Bloodborne.
beautiful!!
This feels like an MMO its that big
Another incredible adventure from Fromsoftware. Their games have only gotten more approachable as time's gone on, so this is a good place to start if you'd like to try the series. Just know that it's very long (40+ hours casually) compared to earlier titles. I would recommend one of those if you want a shorter adventure. While I'm disappointed in the quality of this PC port (60 FPS cap, occasional shader cache stuttering, etc) this is hardly unusual for this studio. The Easy Anti Cheat makes the game take longer to launch and probably has some performance impact but I would not want to deal with cheaters in a game like this. I do wish you could disable it if you only planned on playing offline without needing to rename executable files. Solid 9.5/10 game with a 7.5/10 PC port.
everything amazing

Game of the decade for me. I've had so much fun exploring the world, learning the enemies different movesets, and ultimately beating the game once I figured a lot of it out. This was my very first souls-like game that I've ever played and I'm glad I took the time to get better at it. I've since gone on to create special characters inspired by other franchises like Adventure Time and later Marvel Comics. I look forward to the DLC and finding new ways to have fun with it.
just good
Yes
very good

e
If you like dying a lot and starting over again and again then this is for you. I found this game very annoying as even if you clear a zone then you get killed easily the enemy appear each time you respawn so you got to do it all again. I got bored in the end . The world is ok . Seem people like this sort of game but for me no fun at all
so good
This is my favorite action combat RPG to date. Absolutely increadible adventure.

Highly recommend playing together with friends using the seamless co-op mod.

The experience can be improved futher by finding a good playlist of RPG/Epic fantasy music like Lord of the Rings for exploring open fields or Harry Potter for Raya Lucaria. The OST in most open world areas is a low droning hum as with most FROM titles.
Mixing it up with a nice playlist of songs is lovely.
really good
coping. seething. malding. 10/10.
this game is very very well done. it is hard at times and tests any player. however there are many ways to level up a weak player in mindless combat and succeed to beat your foes. the game is huge and open world like a skyrim world. however i believe there should be better towns and non combative AI in the game to make it even more in depth.
best game ever made, change my mind
This game does not need a review, just buy it
Honestly, this is the best soulsborne game. I've played and beat every souls game including demon souls on ps5. To everyone who says the game is too difficult, I have some tips. The games layout is amazingly placed and spaced out. Go out and explore find better equipment, especially the wonderous physick and maybe some spirit ash summons, and find runes. I'm not going to say 'git gud' bluntly but there is a learning curve to the bosses, but once you understand their patterns you'll enjoy the bosses and game more.
In the grand scheme of things, heralding Elden Ring for its brilliance is akin to declaring that gravity tends to keep us grounded - it's a universally acknowledged truth at this point. Yet, here I am, compelled to throw my hat into the ring, or rather, the Lands Between, to sing praises of a game that has skillfully commandeered countless hours of my life, much to the bemusement of my wife, the occasional frustration of my four kids, and the sheer indifference of my two cats and slightly concerned dog.

Elden Ring is not just a game; it's a lifestyle choice, a commitment to exploring every nook and cranny of a world so vast and unforgiving that I often found myself wondering whether my real family might start sending out search parties to the sofa. From the towering bosses that sent me to my doom more times than I care to admit, to the breathtaking vistas that made those repeated demises somewhat bearable, this game is a masterpiece of masochism.

Jokingly, I told my family that Elden Ring was a complex tutorial on time management and resilience. My wife didn't buy it, especially after the third "just one more boss" at 2 AM. My kids have started using terms like "You died" far more frequently than I'm comfortable with, albeit in completely unrelated contexts. The cats seem to have aligned their nap times with my gaming sessions, and my dog has developed a keen sense for when I'm about to face a boss, choosing those exact moments to need a walk.

In all seriousness, Elden Ring is a testament to the art of video games. Its intricate world design, challenging combat, and rich storytelling are a beacon for what the medium can achieve. Yes, it demands time, patience, and a willingness to embrace failure as a teacher, but the rewards it offers in return are unparalleled.

To the developers, I offer my heartfelt thanks for this monumental achievement. To potential players, be warned: Elden Ring will consume your time, test your patience, and challenge your skills. But it will also reward you with one of the most fulfilling gaming experiences of your life.

And to my family, thank you for your patience, your understanding, and for not changing the locks on me. Yet. Here's to many more hours in the Lands Between‚Äîpreferably when everyone else is asleep, and the pets are fed.
10/10
Ranni.
I've played every game in this series, but this one could be my favorite.  There's a lot of good options for weapons and playstyle, and there's so many unique enemies, even if some of them are copies.  The actual core story path to the end is not too long, but the optional content is near 100 hours, not including replays. 

The gameplay is so good, it makes people hallucinate a story.  My only complaint is that the co-op is a bit clunky.  There's thankfully a mod for that, but I don't give the devs credit for community-made content.

It's the DARK SOULS (TM) of FromSoft games 
9.5/10

Probably the only open-world game on the market that successfully captured my heart in its gameplay. The world is vast and expansive, but has a lot of action and interesting things to do to not make it feel drawn out and boring.
The world itself is beautiful at every corner you can find, the developers really nailed the visual feel of each and every area to make it unique and feel monumental to reach a new area.
The weapons are varied and beautiful. Be it sorceries, incantations, or flashy weapons, you'll definitely find something to pick up and fall in love with.
This game even lets you summon Spirits which can allow you to buddy up with certain entities that would have acted as opponents for you in the past, but can fight alongside you using their Spirit Ashes in areas with daunting enough challenges.
The combat is punishing but (mostly) fair. It's FromSoft's signature combat system that defines their games and gives them that unique form of challenge, and you're sure to like it too.
The only things stopping me from giving the game a 5/5 is the boss difficulty scaling and weapon upgrades. While the upgrade system itself is fine, getting the materials for upgrading can occasionally be a hassle to go through since they can be hidden in obscure and easy-to-miss spots, but ultimately it's a minor issue at worst.
The far bigger issue in my opinion is the boss scaling. Most bosses are very easy with the right tools and equipment until the late game (mostly things you would fight after [spoiler]Fire Giant[/spoiler]), and afterwards bosses become extremely difficult to a near-unreasonable degree. Most of the time this works in the boss's favor as you can still learn and master the moveset with enough practice, but I think it would have been better if the spike wasn't so intense compared to the bosses before them.
Overall it's a great game and well worth the asking price of the game. I'd at least recommend trying it out if you have time to invest in it.
Gud Game

I wake up. I play Elden Ring. I go to work. I think about Elden Ring at work. I come home. I play Elden Ring. I go to bed.
game of the Years
I like this game
Easy game for beginners
cheeks
fun
This game brought me into the souls genre. It is a true, open-world experience that may be challenging at times but rewards the player in many ways. The world building and amount of rewarding exploration are exceptional.
Mum ranni gives me big sword but im to stupid to use it =((
Elden Ring is probably one of my favorite games despite being absolutely nerve wracking as I never played a Souls game before. 

Expect weird tensions in your shoulders, your hands and lots of swearing at sneaky goblins in the catacombs. Everyone you love will die. Everyone you hate will also die. 

After 70% of the game, you will feel an overcoming loneliness as the game becomes more barren as you move forward, that's my only complaint.

The good thing is that I now wake my husband with ARISE YE TARNISHED so we can play on the co-op mod, which is what made me pick up the game once more, as I despaired (maidenless), incapable of beating this unforgiving game by myself.
the dlc will make this game a masterpiece

Worth mentioning definitely has the weakest start among the fromsoft games naturally because of the open world nature makes it a bit difficult to get immersed from the beginning. Double boss fights really suck in this game a massive downgrade from previous fromsoft games duplicating bosses lazily without much thought behind it is a big step down from all previous double boss fromsoft entries. Also I have to say the game is a lot more enjoyable on replay for some reason? Not sure if that's cus being lost in it isn't as fun as knowing where to go idk.

Also 2 years later on a new playthrough i finally beat melania on my own. Taking a total of 30hrs or so. I take back all my complaints one of the most satisfying bosses ever. with amazing lore, soundtrack and atmosphere. I cannot wait to see Miquella one of my favourite fromsoft characters ever developed in the DLC.
10/10 would recommend. love all the fromsoft games.
I'm constantly get lost in the big open world.
JUST LIKE REAL LIFE! Would recommend.
elden ring
good game
Pvp feels better
Could this be lover?
best game ever. Please make bloodbourne on PC :D
My first soulslike, great game in almost every aspect (my only problem is that it's easy to get overleveled when you actually explore the locations)
One of the greatest open world games ever, over 100 hours of content on a single playthrough and you still won't be done exploring this world. Every main location is unique and looks stunning, with something new on every corner. The great variety in weapons and  the many options provided to you by incantations and sorceries allow for a near unlimited amount of viable and creative ways to beat this game. If you happen to run into a boss you can' t beat and you don' t feel like trying over and over or walking away to level up, you can summon a co-op player or use spirit ashes to make it easier. 

Obviously there are a few cons, a lot of bosses have arbitrarly enhanced difficulty via use of delayed attacks, almost undodgeable attacks (looking at you Malenia) or hyper armor. Quite a few non main bosses are reskins of previously encountered bosses, especially the duo bosses, which are just two reused bosses in the same arena. However, due to the vast number of unique bosses this hardly takes away from the experience, unless you are expecting every boss to be on par with Sekiro's best.
In addition to the gameplay I personally found the soundtracks to be a little underwhelming at times, but you won't notice this when you are trying not to die.
The true ending is letting Aurelia take her little sister to see the stars
Kill Malenia. Behead Malenia. Roundhouse kick Malenia into the concrete. Slam dunk Malenia into the trash can. Crucify Malenia. Defecate in Malenia's food. Launch Malenia into the sun. Stir fry Malenia in a rock. Toss Malenia into active volcanoes. Urinate on Malenia's helmet. Judo throw Malenia into an abductor‚Äôs chipper. Twist Malenia‚Äôs head off. Report Malenia to LMSH. Karate chop Malenia in half. Ground slam Malenia. Trap Malenia in the Leyndell sewers. Stunlock Malenia. Liquify Malenia in a vat of black flame. Dissect Malenia. Stomp Malenia skulls with steel toed boots. Cremate Malenia in the oven. Lobotomize Malenia. Grind Malenia in the garbage disposal. Drown Malenia in fried blood grease. Vaporize Malenia with the frenzied flame. Kick Malenia down the Haligtree. Feed Malenia to dragons. Slice Malenia with rivers of blood.
its good
Of all the soul games, this seemed to be the most difficult.In no episode of ds have I been fucked like this
Melina is hot

An ideal game for a lifelong gamer transitioning through the struggles of adulthood. As someone who missed out on the Dark Souls series, this was my first experience playing a game that rewards you for mastering certain skills and weapons outside of immediate game-breaking upgrades. If I'm being honest, the upgrades were almost necessary to survive and sometimes felt like it wouldn't be enough to overcome an upcoming challenge. There will almost certainly be a point where you will realize that you need to be upgraded, not the player tools. All in all, this game demands mastery for completion. There are ways to cheese the game but you will feel shame for using them. I'm looking at you, bleeders, sleepers, greasers, dragon seal users. I'm only kidding, that was the first way I beat the game, but I didn't feel like the victory was earned. Definitely the best game I've played in years, very refreshing from what's been put out recently from big name studios. Play it, you'll see what I mean. Not only will the lessons of mastery will apply to life but any history or art enthusiast will appreciate the references.  A masterful game. Can't wait for the DLC

perfect game. 10/10. no notes.
Better than my ex wife.
Best open world game I've played, for Fromsoft to have done such an amazing job on their first attempt is a testament to how great they are as a video game development studio. Amazing world to explore, great characters and stories (though very convoluted to finish the quests), tight controls, lots of cool weapons and builds to try out. It's a very very good game.

Up there with Dark Souls in terms of its lore and atmosphere, though unfortunately plagued with a lot of unfairness in its gameplay, as I felt they were trying to just 1-up themselves in difficulty without much thought of how fun or fair it would be. Very much felt like luck played a large factor in whether I beat certain bosses. Some fights are just really bad and unfun, it's a shame that the bosses, which have been some of the strongest things about From's games, are at their weakest here.
Most damning is the final boss, its first phase is very cool and fun to learn, but the second phase is the worst boss that Fromsoft has ever done and feels completely unnecessary.

It's very good :3
good game
Probably the best RPG ever made.
just an amazing gme all round
A [Masterpiece] and the best one out of souls like so far. Open world exploration is incredible, with a great number of bosses, different amount of builds and systems that enable one to try different builds, and it retains the good qualities of previous DS.

The vast amount of content and a huge world can be overwhelming, but if you like dark souls and the open world then this is the best of both
played (and completed) many other souls games but the way the devs artificially boosted "difficulty" in this game is so stupid, all bosses have the same move-set witch is an unending charge against you with endless attacks with endless stamina and no natural pauses to set a good pace for the fight, either you land a 5-6 series of perfect timed rolls to get in a single attack or your shit out of luck, try blocking? forget it all mobs even in the starting area have endless heavy attacks that break your guard and lets talk about the low IQ way they gave all monsters aimbot, a monster swinging a MASSIVE 500Kg hammer? and you run or roll out of the way... forget it! the game just sets all laws of physics to the side and lets the monster pivot towards you with spinbot accuracy and hits you behind them even tho it started the attack facing the other way... its retarded.  why they ruin an otherwise pretty and awesome game with such poor "boss" design is beyond me, i wanted to like the game, but after 20-30 bosses all with the same idiotic design i just said.. forget it this is bad. Get dark souls 1-2-3 instead this is shit.. Game of the year award my ass!

Friend : How much would you rate Elden Ring out of 10?
Me: Yes
Elden Ring was a magical experience with its story telling and the expansive world and it teaches us the very basics of the game right at the start of the game, "If youre struggling with something, explore something else and then come back again when you are ready for the challenge". The story telling is on point, the world is beautifully designed, the NPC story quests are wonderfully interconnected(which is all optional but still connects to different endings without spoiling anything). To truly get the best out of the game, YOU MUST play it through blind in your first run. And then on the second time onwards, you truly start exploring things that you initially missed out. 

Fromsoft, you have done it again! Kudos.
this game sucks you in once you start leveling up and exploring. its gorgeous.
BEAR WITNESS... to the same loading screen thousands of times

Easily the most accessible and most challenging game Fromsoft has made to date!
As someone who is well-adverse in the Souls Universe, this one... takes the cake. The play-ability and exploration mechanics of an open-world souls-like game, combined with the exquisite depth of lore, makes this game a monument to my sins, a magnum opus if you will. Putting more than 80+ hours may not seem like an impressive feat, but does justify how much time I have given to the game to say the least. I cannot for the life of me think of a game with such beauty and grace conveyed in the lands between, that brings me back to oversea the plains as Elden Lord, Ranni's Consort and the Frenzied Flame Lord. 

This game encapsulates the very desire, the very purpose and accomplishment, pride and joy of beating it. I can only wait and sit on this throne, until the lands call upon me.... once more.

See you all, at the Erd Tree.
First dark souls game i played, i will for sure buy more because elden ring is just AMAZING
good good
Great graphic, can become an entry for new souls like games.
Nah, I'd win.
I've been a From fan ever since I was introduced to them during DS1 and I gotta say, I have always loved their titles from Sekiro to Bloodborne and back to the Souls series. But this game. THIS GAME. Is a marvelous piece of work; The music, the world itself, the character design, the boss fights. Not a single thing felt neglected in this game. After playing the game for hundreds of hours, I can rest assured in saying that this is my favorite game of all time and is easily the best game From has ever put out. If you take the time to read the items in the game to understand the lore you'll find many layers of complexity and many, many more moving gears to all of those layers. George R. R. Martin did a great job with his story writing (unsurprisingly). I cannot wait to play the DLC in June. If you are asking, "Should I purchase this game?", the answer is stop asking and get it right now. You are missing out on an experience no other game will come close to delivering.
I WILL BECOME THE ELDEN LORD
One of the best FromSoftware games to date!

A reserved thumbs up.
It's a beautiful game, with an incredible atmosphere, some intriguing ideas, and some delightfully intricate level design.
On the minus side, the plot and lore are impressionistic at best (i.e, come across as mostly incomprehensible, nonsensical or just plain random), the platforming elements are poor, and the edgelord approach to the gaming experience ultimately works against any real sense of immersion. Most major obstacles you don't overcome by getting good, but an unavoidable process of trial and error, over-levelling, or cheesing bosses.
keeps crashing
One of the best Games of all Time. Awesome in every Regard. The Culmination of all Fromsoft Games. Maybe not good for people who don't like open world games tho.

"I am Melanie god o........" *Blasphemous Blade go Brrrrrrr*
10/10 Best game i have played in years
got called maidenless by an npc, killed the npc, and then got locked out of his questline for the rest of the game.

worth it
The Blue Mommy called my name. "Pablo Erlenmeyer" she spoke. And I, a felled tarnished, rose from my slumber in search of the Elden Ring. Since i am Him, i skipped the tutorial area and went straight into Limgrave where i met a man who called me Maidenless. He was right. But he had the eyes of a trickster who would backstab me at any turn. So i killed him and abandoned my quest for the Elden Ring so that i may simp after the Blue Mommy from my dreams. I embarked on this new quest in this strange land and was immediately humbled by a giant knight on a horse. It was a challenge. My past versions of my life flashed before my eyes and gave me wisdom to slay this worthy foe. Then i emerged with great power and PTSD.

I met a side bitch who really wanted me to get the Elden Ring for some reason so i figured i would help her out while i was at it. After i made it to Margit, who humbled me further and gave me more PTSD, i stormed Stormveil Castle with accidental map exploits and made it to Godrick. Im not sure what he was smoking but he wanted to start shit so i had to put him down. Walking out, i was free from being bound by the mortal plane and realized that the mortal plane was fucking massive. With many trails and tribulations persevered, and many experiences that enhanced my PTSD, i found myself at Hogwarts. My waifus mom didnt seem to approve of my simping and tried to kill me. I was able to subdue her and obtain my loot. Soon i met Blue Mommy herself. Like many women in my simping experiences, she had me run errands for her and left me feeling sad and alone. 

Lost and betrayed, i wandered the land upon entering hell. It was called Caelid. There was another soul in this land who was like me. His mind lost. His soul broken. His name was Radahn. Unfortunately, we could not communicate and fought each other in mortal combat. Many others came to celebrate in this joyous occasion as Radahn found peace in his dying breaths. With the weight of the literal planets off his back and transferred to mine, i set off to claim my throne as Elden Lord.

Lindel. Day 32. That motherfucker Margit came back from the dead and ambushed me on my horse. I didnt take kindly to that and trained my sights on the giant tree in the sky. I will avenge you Torrent. Lindel. Day 69. I fought a giant ghost and stand before Margit, the slayer of Torrent. His name is Morgot? Why is music playing? He tried to make me touch Grass. The only thing he did was enhance my PTSD even further. I approach the tree. Ready to claim my throne. I can no longer sleep. Every time i blink i see the other versions of me get torn to pieces or falling to death. Knowledge itself is a curse. But now it was worth it. WHY THE FUCK CANT I ENTER THE TREE!?

I roam the land. There was a weird giant one eyed monster that shot fire. Like all the others, he too fell to my blade. I approach the volcano as my side bitch instructed. She caught on fire and died. Then i died and woke up in hell this time fr fr. This place. This can be my resting place. PLACIDUSAX IT WAS JUST A JOKE!? WHY IS THERE A SKINNY AND FAT MAN EMERGING FROM THE VOID!? DID THAT DOG BACKFLIP OFF HIS SWORD!?

Denied even death, i crawled out of hell and returned to Waifus Watchtower. Where i met a fellow simp who offered me advice. He could have killed me, but he was a fellow warrior who was plagued by PTSD. He reinvigorated me and encouraged me to keep going. To never touch grass and to Simp to the best of my ability, even if there is nobody to see me. So i did. Even when she didnt see. I still simped and i fought Astel. a giant skeleton centipede who bled despite being dead.

I returned to Lindel. I was ready to claim my throne. A mage stood in my path. He was like all mages and was all talk. Godfrey, the ghost i fought when i first came here was waiting for me in the flesh. It was an epic battle. He said "The World" and the whole arena exploded. His Stand Power was no match for me and i entered the tree. But what came next was a true battle of epic proportions. I fought God, who had turned the stone. He was unwilling to give up the Elden Ring. But as i lay defeated on the stone floor, a dear friend appeared. The very friend who encouraged me to stay simping, Jolder. Together we slayed God. But that wasnt all. A new creature appeared and looked to be made out of the heavens itself. Ready to face this foe, i turned and saw that Jolder had faded into dust. I was devastated, but i knew that this was my journey and i had to end it. Im not sure what happened. All i knew was that i fought. 

When i opened my eyes. She was there. Ranni. She came back. I slid the Elden Ring onto her ring finger and vowed the eternal matrimony. The world was remade and found new prosperity under her rule. Finally. The pain. The agony. The torment. All of it was fading away as i close my eyes.

Then i woke up. I was in Limgrave again. That snake spouting the same Maidenless drivel. All of it was a dream. A nightmare. I was denied paradise. Now.. i would see the world burn.

This game is pretty, but I couldn't get into it because I wasn't enjoying myself. Almost everything I met killed me several times over, and I couldn't find a way to improve my character or weapons. Or, rather, I found there are supposed to be ways but the explanations were confusing and I lacked the materials needed. I thought I would get the materials from difficult fights, but the ones I managed to complete gave me nothing but currency.

There's very little guidance aside from messages left by other players, and those are often actively unhelpful. I know I could look up tutorials online but I don't have a reason to want to. I'd rather just not play. From what I can tell, most of this game is about running back to the last place you died over and over until you don't die. That just does not appeal to me in the slightest.
UNBELIEVABLY FRUSTRATINGLY THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME. 10/10 WILL PLAY ATLEAST 34 PLAYTHROUGHS IN MY LIFETIME
This is best soul game with all the unique mechanics. And for me, this is my first soul game. Don't get discouraged as you are bound to die a lot of time. Just take your time and roam around the open world to understand the things. Don't go for leveling or anything on Youtube. 
Enjoy:)
Absolutely incredible game in every singular way.

This has to be the greatest game of all time. The game is perfect from its soundtracks, to its visuals, its mechanics, the boss fights, and the map (except the lake of rot). I loved the boss fights and the meaning behind a lot of them. Highly recommend to everyone unless you rage easily.

Beautiful landscapes, open world only blocked by challenges, great soundtrack, and diverse playstyles. The modding community is healthy, and playing with Seamless Coop is very fun.

Elden Ring has incredible mini and legacy dungeons, bosses, a stunning open world with a map that just keeps on growing and is unmatched when it comes to inspiration for my tabletop RPG. Like other Souls games the combat is punishing, with a wealth of weapon choices, spells and special skills that you can run practically any build you wish, but you'll probably just end up running Bloodhound Fang and Starfists lol. 7 days out of the week I recommend playing Elden Ring
I fell for this game hard
10/10 expect for the rivers of blood and spell spammers :D
Elden Ring will beat your ass for 10 hours then pat you on the back for 1. Do with that what you will

Best game ever
Git Gud ^^
Nice game. Great time indeed. Worth your money.
Beware of dog.
For me this turned out to be a delicious candy wrapped in a layer of dung. 

The good:

It's a From Software game, and as such the basic mechanics are solid, you got lore scattered throughout the game, and the areas are distinct and solid. The graphics are amazing, and there are some genuinely pretty areas that are absolutely breathtaking the first time you find them. The selection of weapons, shields, armors, consumables and various stat boosting items is fairly wide, you got a host of equippable special attacks (called Ashes of War in the game) and if you're a spellcaster the spell variety is huge, 

The bad:

PC is still marred with connectivity issues 2 years after the game's release, meaning that if you're into organic co-op or pvp, you will experience noticeably worse latency compared to the console version. Speaking of co-op, the AI come across as extremely poor at handling multiple opponents, and will often appear to "break" in the sense that enemies will wander around aimlessly without attacking. Alternatively, if the enemy is capable of casting spells, you can end up in a situation where they spam spells endlessly, and you end up stuck in a loop where you constantly have to dodge and can't close the distance to break them out of it. 

The game also suffer quite a bit under its size compared to earlier Fromsoft titles, which means that endgame bosses tend to become damage sponges to keep the game challenging. You can of course spec your character for status effects, as you can melt a lot of late game bosses with them, but personally I don't like that sort of pigeonholing in an action RPG.

The next thing on the list is that a lot of enemies have attacks to punish panic rolls, and while it was a nice change of pace back in Dark Souls 3, it quickly gets old when everyone and their grandma can and will punish poorly timed rolls. A noticeable amount of enemies also have "not technically input reading" dodges, as trying to attack them with projectiles or even melee attacks will trigger a dodge at the first frame of the attack animation. On the surface it makes sense, as one would expect enemies to try to avoid getting hit. However, if you lack the burst damage to bring them down, for example if you missed upgrade materials or don't have the proper damage stats, they can become extremely tedious to fight. With that said there are certain attacks that won't trigger the dodge, but then I'm back to this feeling of pigeonholing in an RPG again. A few enemies also have a "get out of jail free" card in the form of a backward skip they can't be staggered out of, adding to the tedium of bringing them down. 

A more personal gripe since I'm a Dark Souls 3 pvp veteran is that some enemies embody the worst behaviors of players back in DS3. They have infinite stamina, meaning they will roll spam forever because your attack animation trigger their "oh no, need to dodge" script. They also have infinite FP (Fromsoft's mana system), meaning they will spam spells out the wazoo, and while you try to dodge one they will cast another, stagger you out of your roll and make you eat an attack that will inista-delete you, It's like fighting the DS3 griefers with full Havel's armor and Dark Hand all over again.

If you have gotten so far, you might wonder why I still have over 1000 hours in this game. The answer is that despite all its flaws the game still provide a unique experience, and that's enough to pull me back in after I swear I will never play this game again and take a 6 month break. Make of it what you will.
G.OA.T
A fantastic game deserving of every single accolade it was given
best game of all time
A good mate gifted it to me and I didn't even finish it yet :(
very fun

I want a hot goth bitch to step on my balls.
Played this game for over 150 hours on xbox, now on pc and I replayed it again in order to play the DLC coming soon if that doesn't tell you that this game is incredible I don't know what will. Good luck fellow tarnished.
by far the most easy soulsborune game
god tier game

sick ass game and ranni is bas asl
yes
Beautiful open world, fantastic world building, and insane replayability! 
10/10 and well worth it, even at full price.
i like to suffer and cry
i could write for hours to explain how this game is the best experience i had in gaming!
RISE NOW YE TARNISHED!!!!
Good game but you might break your setup if you buy
goat. play or die.
I have always loved the genre.  People complain about difficulty? Nonsense. You need to learn the game.  Study the moves and practice.  Truly one of the most rewarding games I have played in a long time.  Well worth the time you spend.  Play the other FROM software games.  they are great.  Still want Bloodborne for the PC.
good game, one of the few
Good game, magic a bit strong
Difficult but rewarding open-world Souls game from FromSoft. The culmination of 6 game that created and defined a whole new genre. Now with a larger then ever DLC scheduled to be release. What else is there to say?
Let me start with saying I suck at hard games.  I don't care to put endless hours of work in to beat a single boss.  I knew what soulslike games were when I bought this, I just heard that this was a little more forgiving.  If you do not like soulslike games but you are thinking this will be a different experience, don't waste your money like I did.
amazing game
Esperienza di gioco davvero coinvolgente! Alcune dinamiche sono ripetitive ma per lo pi√π  sorprendente e divertente! Mappa enorme, ci si pu√≤ perdere in ogni zona in tantissime avventure! Super consigliato anche a neofiti! Basta armarsi di pazienza per divertirsi tantissimo 
Super consigliato
Fromsoftware's masterpiece. Loads of fun solo or with friends. Sufficiently challenging with ability to use gameplay elements to increase or decrease that challenge to one's liking. Glorious feel and fun.
goated game, makes me wet
-10/10 save data back dated never going back its too much work LOL
idk magic go bur i guess

One of the greatest games out there!
marika looks friendly
in the wise words of peter griffin  "holy f**k im c*****g"
stinky
Dying 287 times to a single boss, just to defeat him and realise you still need to do the rest of the game. Killing an npc at the start of the playtrough only to realise he was needed for the best armor.

10/10
Perfect
Loving this so far. Difficult - just persist with it
i like men and swords
going to be the third time im gonna try get into this game lol
best game of the century
Its my favorit game. I've never seen anything like this. Just fantastic
Praise the Erdtree!
Changed my life for the better. The feeling of awe and adventuire you get in this game is unmatched... goodluck finding all the secrets
It's a bestselling game that's not easy, so the fact that 9.1% of players have unlocked all the achievements (which requires beating it three times) speaks volumes about how good it is.
Worst game ive ever played in my entire life
Where tf do I go next?
No review can do this game justice, just buy it.
 üëç
Yes
This game was a great game. It has that dark fantasy feel, and that old school game feel where they don't hold your hand. Combat is not as fluid as I would like it to feel, but overall plays well. Art taste is great as well.
probably a decent game  IF you dont want to rebind your KEYS...     
Lets Hard lock all the keys on the right hand for use  ONLY to navigate the  rebinding  key section... 

Game design  10/10    PC  keyboard support   0 / 10
I will leave the cat here, so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards.

ELDEN RING OHH ELDEN RING
Voted this as the GOTY for 2022 without having played it, as I was hesitant to surrender myself to so much pain and git gud.
Played it in 2023 and was proven right for my vote.

A mash up of the best aspects of all combats in the Soulsborne catalog set in a Zelda Breath of the Wild open world that invites you to investigate every nook and cranny, just to be surprised by another abomination, giant monster, horde of enemies or a classic ole dragon to smack your tarnished butt back to the roundtable hold.

Maybe this is the start of a horrible masochistic adicition, but either way: 5/7 perfect game
dark souls 2 sucked
big game
I FUCKING LOVE IT
yes
...Ah
I knew you'd come.
To stand before the Elden Ring.
To become Elden Lord.
What a sad state of affairs.
I commend your spirit, but alas,
none shall take the throne.
Qeen Marika has high hope for us.
Tha we continue to struggle.
Unto enternity.
nice
awesome
‚ô¶The Best Experience I've Ever Had‚ô¶
Need the horni scenes from bg3 but with elden ring characters
i kicked sir gideon in the head.
It's ok I guess. Not every game can be dark souls 2
We are kindred, belike two eyes which gaze upon the other. FEAR NOT, THE DARK, MY FRIEND. AND LET THE FEAST BEGIN:`)
GOAT
One of the best games of all time for sure. FromSoft's Magnum Opus.
liar ahead
Fun
The best game forever

good

goty for a reason
Great game 10/10.
The Skyrim of souls games
Its good.
The game is okay, but I think it needs a bit more gore.
it good
Great game but no surprise there. Fromsoft does it again
Yes Yes YESS
Banger
Edit - 120+ hours later still a banger

i dont often write reviews but THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!
Good Dark Souls impression.
Haha Bloodhound's Fang go brrrrr
Bad Dark Souls impression.
Thou strength befits a crown
nice game, some bosses are difficult to beat, but overall a great game
I've heard a lot about Dark Souls games, but never played one.  Watching a few video clips and streamers talk about how good the world design is, I gave it a try.  After 40 mins I put it down, wasn't into it.  Then came back to it a few months later to give it another try.  Now I'm hooked.  Combat is some times frustrating, because of hit boxes, and camera reseting...but overall this is an amazing game.  Truly open world.  YouTube video hints will be needed.
I wish i could go back in time and play this for the first time again.
10/10
Easy game
A must play for the lovers of the RPG genre.
Not Bloodborne üò°
Better than Dark Souls 3
Truly one of the greatest of all time!
best game
no one will see this anyway but I play this game in the name of the fingers, for they are the one and only thing to enter my hole with the divine grace pleasurable enough to endure my needs.

Honestly this game is perfect. I've played this game in the dirt and I still can't get enough of it! Get it........ Beat the game tarnished.... before the shadows reach the realms!
GREAT
nice
Genuine masterpiece of a game with lots of replay value. You should pick it up and play.
Miyazaki's son is being bullied at school because he can't dodge malenia's waterfowl dance perfectly
"Nah I'd Win" proceed spend 20 hours fighting malenia, best game in the world
gud game.
Good gam
Goood Game, you can kill big scary monsters.
Alexander GOAT
Great souls-bourn game like Bloodbourn. Def worth it now we getting the DLC finally. It can be brutal sometimes so just get back up dust of you nice threads and grab that weapon!
Be wary of death
very easy game
You wont even regret buying it on full price. One of the all time best games.
Simply one of the greatest open world fantasy games I have ever played
i told her what to say to review this game she said 
"i love milf" -(my gf)

hi
Best Souls Game Ever Made In My Opinion..
"EPIC" but not fun if that makes sense. It's obviously a masterpiece but it is not that fun to play.
honestly one of the best games ive ever played
the game is good but the engine is shit to many frame drops. 
please optimise the performance. 

The sewer is the worst designed area in the game the jumping puzzle part was pure jank.
And they reused a boss. 
OK game but don't listen to Vaatividya there isn't any lore. he looks at BS item descriptions and starts talking out his ass.

Im just hating its actually a good game.
worth TO PLAY IT

very fun
9/10
Game of the Year for good reason. Everything that people liked about Dark Souls, but perfected. Story was good enough that I didn't even resent G.R.R finding yet more excuses to not finish his damn books. If your buddies kept bugging you to play souls-like games and you never could figure out why they loved them, try Elden Ring. You'll get it.  10/10. Can't recommend enough.
THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU GO INSANE FOR HOURS !! DEFINITELY WORTH IT !!
I AM MALENIA, BLADE OF MIQUELLA AND I HAVE NEVER KNOWN DEFEAT
I died 3,287,172 times in 5 minutes 10/10
Hell yeah.
God, I hate souls-like games so fucking much. They're the worst trend to happen to gaming. Period. I tried - I really did, but fuck this genre and fuck this game in particular.
game good
Fantastic game. Corrupt save file after 84 hours.  Apparently this is still happening. Resulted in character loss.

the first 30%~40% of the game was amazing but after that i didnt enjoy my time with it , i think FS should abandoned the open world in the future.
10/10 Stop crying and just welcome the sweet embrace of death.

World, characters, visuals are amazing and so beautiful you can easily get lost in immersion. Cant think of a game where I've enjoyed exploration so much apart from MMO's!
top 5 games of all time

The bosses suck
goty
Just wow
dont blink
great game, not for the feint of heart!

yes!
idk how this game can be so complete and well designed after absolutely broken dark souls series
In a game where i can run around as nuts from berk and kill borderline apostles, it's pretty nice, you can play with friends, and mod it to new heights with the imposing risk of being banned, in my book, that's a 10/10 with a lack of griffith on top, peak gaming, yep, right here

Best game to ever exist, quite literally game of the century. Truly the pinnacle of video games, maybe Gods greatest gift to mankind.

Masterpiece, like to see it as Zelda for grow ups.
Great game, Great lore and certainly one of my favorite souls games. Great world building and lots of exploring. This game rekindled my love for gaming after a huge dry streak. Can't wait for the DLC
good
It isn't an open world fantasy game if it doesn't have a giant tree.
Lit
4 Hours in ive only seen one enemy type and it's the Tree Sentinel
OMG I can not express how much I love this game, its so big and has such a great story line and you can tell how much effort was put into it by everyone helping. Im so exited for the DLC and I know its going to be amazing too. Please download this game I have played for over 106 hours and if thats not enough convincing I dont know what is
Its pretty good
game us do smainzg
Best thing since Elden Ring
W
i
Bosses hit harder than inflation.
Pretty OK game
this game is the best game ive ever played in my life
i need sleep...help me.... D:
Yes
Fire Giant is top tier boss love hitting his feet and smelling his ballsack until he dies 

Godskin duo is just as good making it more technical and challening for the player when theres now two bosses poking the fuck out of you

maliketh on the other hand needs to be removed that shit is dodging simulator 3
it was ok i kind of wish it had a battle pass with an item shop tho
What can any of us say? The game has made the ultimate impact. whether you like it or not, its a huge cultural touchstone. Its forever changed gaming. 10/10 perfect game.
Easily the best of all the Soulsbourne games.
no horse shrex
I was never a "souls" player. Hell, I was never a role playing game player. In fact, I've never liked the genre very much in all my years of gaming. Even objectively great titles like Fall Out failed to convert me and my incessant need for the instant gratification of FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield. And then came Elden Ring. It truly is a masterpiece of a game. The map design is unique and incredibly expansive. The aesthetic is gorgeous and sometimes it honestly felt like I was gaming inside of an art painting. The game play itself, much to my delight, is very forgiving due to the fact that the game design is open world allowing players to go around bosses or avoid optional bosses entirely while leveling their character up. Elden Ring was much needed relief to players like me who had grown tired of top tier software developers lazily cranking out games for the sake of profit seeking rather than for the love of crafting engaging and challenging video games. Take it from me, a person who never spent more than a few hours failing at RPGs like Dark Souls, Elden Ring worth every penny.
Not my first souls game and will most definitely not be my last! Can always come back to this game at any point and get stuck playing for hours. Truly a masterpiece if I do say so myself
so good so great so good so great

I know you've heard this game is great,beautiful,and fun and i can safely say that there all true.This game is everything you live up to.I would not recommend this game if you don't have any spare time on your hands.Every place on the map is gorgeous.I love all of the boss fight (except godfrey).I think this game is good for everyone and if you have the spare money definitely give this game a shot.
How do I fix the screen flickering? HELP
beat it in 5 hours and 42 minutes and 49 seconds on one save. highly recommend very fun short game

If you sucked at Dark Souls, this game is for you. If you were awesome at Dark Souls this, this game is for you. If you haven't heard of Dark Souls, this game is for you. If you like Berserk, seek help.

Just a phenomenal experience. If you have liked other games in the souls series, you will adore this game. It truly is a grand project from FromSoft. I have about 300 hours on my playstation.

Fantastic game and a good intro for me to FromSoftware and the Soulslike genre as a whole.

Fromsoft's Magnum Opus- its golden child. An accumulation of years of perfecting its established souls-like genre then thrown into a truly open world. Not only the perfect game for newcomers to the genre but a love letter to all the cult followers behind past games. Without a doubt, of the decade.
Amazing game all around. Very challenging but rewarding for the challenge.
margit is my dad
Lowly tarnished, thourt unfit even to graft.

I've been playing for 10 hours and i only have one achievement.
The best game in history

Good Game, Mods make it even more fun.

One of the best games I've ever played. Was very frustrating at times but very satisfying once you get past those bosses. Can't wait for the DLC!
A FromSoft game of literal epic proportions!
It's Elden Ring. Do it.
Good game
mid ahh souls game

Awesome

There's no game out there that can even get close to the experience that Elden Ring is offering. Probably one of the best games I have ever played.
It's pretty good game
Yo you can get shit on by a hot, rotting woman. 10/10 would recommend :)
Ever wanted to get raped by something other than the government for five minutes??? You haven't??? Well this is the perfect game for you! Yes, YOU dear readers. You will find tons of story where you least expect it. The difficulty isn't as bad as one might think. Just a simple boss rush where EVERYONE is the boss and you are their little bitch boi!!! A grand time for all ages!
perfection.



also try fingers, but hole

pretty fun
nice
One of the most beautiful games I have seen comparably to red dead 2 BUT cannot fuck the blaid 0/10 would not recommend
Goated
Puto juego de mierda me cago la vida lo amo
As a huge Dark Souls fan I am immensely disappointed by Elden Ring on PC... it is more janky than the original Darks Souls PC port, the controller input feels incredibly laggy and full keyboard remapping is not supported. Feels like a very half-donkeyed port!
Best game in the world
I'm Malenia, Blade of Miquella and i never know defeat. You will witness true horror.
There really isn't much to say about this game that hasn't already been said--it's simply a masterpiece of enormous proportion. Without a doubt one of the best I've ever had the privilege of playing. Absolutely jaw-dropping environments around every corner, every section of the game was clearly crafted with care and love, and it offers up some of the most exciting, challenging, and deeply rewarding combat encounters ever seen in the medium with an enormous diversity of builds and items to wet any appetite for combat style. 10/10 without hesitation.

offer pickle!
Absolutely mind-blowing
it's not fun
Lots of fun with challenging but enjoyable boss fights and hundreds of hours of content.
its alright i guess, jk fantastic game 10/10
Fantastic - one of the best games I have ever played. I got whooped more times than I can count, but it was worth it in every way.

Love the game, combat can be bullshit at times but what FromSoft game isn't at points. All you gotta do is get good and you'll have a blast

amazing game must play yippee
Best game of 2023
it make me not want to kill my self unlike cod
This is the furthest I have ever got in a souls-like game, Im not very good at them but this game has really immersed me in its world. At 100hrs I have almost completed the main story (I get side tracked very easily) and I'm already looking forward to the upcoming DLC.
this game blows man
I love Elden Ring
too easy, no challenge, dora the explorer is more difficult

"Elden Ring: A Triumph of Imagination and Challenge

FromSoftware has once again transcended the boundaries of gaming with their latest masterpiece, Elden Ring. This is not merely a game; it's an odyssey through a meticulously crafted world that breathes with life, death, and everything in between.

Set in the mythical and sprawling lands of the Lands Between, Elden Ring introduces players to a world ripe with lore, mystery, and danger. From the moment you step foot into this vast realm, you're greeted with a sense of awe and wonder that rarely dissipates throughout your journey.

At its core, Elden Ring is an action RPG that stays true to the developer's signature style of challenging gameplay and intricate level design. Combat is fluid, weighty, and punishing, demanding precision and strategy from players at every turn. Each encounter feels like a delicate dance of death, where one wrong move can spell disaster, yet every triumph is met with an unparalleled sense of satisfaction.

But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its world-building. FromSoftware has crafted a world that feels alive in every sense of the word. Every corner of the Lands Between is teeming with stories to uncover, secrets to unearth, and breathtaking vistas to behold. The sense of discovery is palpable, urging players to venture off the beaten path and explore every nook and cranny.

Furthermore, Elden Ring boasts a level of freedom rarely seen in games of this magnitude. Gone are the linear corridors of previous titles; instead, players are given the freedom to forge their own path through the world, tackling challenges in any order they see fit. Whether you're delving into ancient dungeons, battling towering bosses, or embarking on epic quests, the choice is yours, and the world responds accordingly.

Of course, no discussion of Elden Ring would be complete without mentioning its breathtaking visuals and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. From the towering spires of castle ruins to the eerie depths of forgotten catacombs, every inch of the world is brought to life with stunning detail and atmosphere. And the music, composed by industry legend Motoi Sakuraba, perfectly complements the game's tone and themes, evoking a sense of melancholy and majesty that lingers long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a game that pushes the boundaries of what interactive storytelling can achieve, inviting players to lose themselves in a world of unparalleled depth and beauty. Whether you're a seasoned Soulsborne veteran or a newcomer to FromSoftware's , Elden Ring is an experience that demands to be played, cherished, and remembered for years to come."
Yes
IT is e realy fun game i liked it

why is it so easy to abuse Torrent?
This game is unforgiving and will kick you in the proverbial nuts time and time again. But still, has a charm the makes you keep trying, a story that will absorb you and even after completing it, you will want to play it again.
Is not a game Is a Experience  10/10!
Beautiful, intriguing, challenging, fun -

Playing it feels how gaming felt as a child!

10/10

Yes
Masterpiece.
Nice Game
its hard but once you get the hang of it its pretty fun

Become Lord
For seasoned players in the Souls-like genre, Elden Ring stands out as a masterpiece that combines thrilling boss fights, dark humor, and immersive gameplay. As someone deeply familiar with these types of games, I found Elden Ring to be a captivating experience filled with memorable moments.

One of the most exciting aspects of Elden Ring is the spontaneous boss fights that can catch you off guard. The game doesn't hold your hand, and encounters with powerful foes can happen unexpectedly, adding an element of surprise and adrenaline to the gameplay. These moments of facing formidable adversaries without warning are reminiscent of the intense challenges found in Dark Souls, keeping players on their toes at all times.

Speaking of Dark Souls, Elden Ring carries on the tradition of the series' signature dark humor. From the classic "going to grab an item and being pushed off a cliff by an enemy" scenario to humorous NPC interactions, the game infuses light-hearted moments amidst its dark and ominous atmosphere, creating a perfect balance of tension and amusement.

However, one drawback I encountered was the limited co-op experience in Elden Ring. While teaming up with friends to tackle tough challenges is enjoyable, the fact that friends are removed from your game after defeating a boss can be a bit disappointing. I believe that implementing a seamless co-op system akin to Lords of the Fallen would enhance the game's immersive nature and encourage more cooperative gameplay throughout the journey.

Despite this minor drawback, Elden Ring remains a must-play for fans of the Souls-like genre. Its challenging gameplay, intriguing world, and blend of dark humor make it a standout title that will keep players engaged for hours on end. Whether facing off against epic bosses or exploring the vast and mysterious lands of the Lands Between, Elden Ring delivers an unforgettable experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression.

Great game from Fromsoft. It has a world that feels lived in but also very lonely. I would recommend this game to previous soulsborne/Sekiro players. Its a very good game with great polish. At launch it had weird frame rate loss, but I don't get that anymore.
worse than sex
This game is a very cool adventure game with medival weapons and bosses

What a game! My first Souls game and it's a great one. The story is great if pieced together through bits and pieces, especially those NPC questlines which can be a real head scratcher to get through, if not downright impossible without looking up a guide. Yet, after having completed all those quests, the storylines are great and the lore feels in-depth and has weight to it. The combat felt great, having a great collection of weapon arts, sorceries and incantations, that I had tons of fun using. Graphically, the game is stunning yet my low end GPU can still run it on high settings, thank you to FromSoft for that. There aren't many negatives. The story never once felt dragged on, and each character's motivations felt meaningful and strong. The only thing might be, as I mentioned earlier, confusing optional quests. 
I'd give this game a 9.5/10 and I'd highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who have never delved into any Souls games before. This might be a great introductory game into the world of Souls, as it certainly was for me. Looking forward to 'Shadow of the Erdtree'!
Have a good one!
man i love rolling then fucking steezus aka draconic treesentinal decides to fuck me in the ass w all of his might. then whan i try to parry him he fucking decides rope me in the ass.


i love this game 100/10

Elden Ring is a game that is as frustrating as it is compelling. FromSoftware has once again managed to create a title that tests the patience and skill of even the most seasoned gamers. However, despite its infuriating moments that can lead to fits of rage and abrupt quits, there's an inexplicable draw that keeps pulling you back into its twisted world.

The map of Elden Ring is nothing short of massive, offering a staggering amount of space to explore. Every corner is teeming with secrets, lore, and challenges waiting to be uncovered. The environments are masterfully crafted, drawing you in with their haunting beauty and mysterious allure. Whether it's scaling treacherous cliffs or delving into dark dungeons, each area begs to be fully explored, rewarding the intrepid adventurer with unforgettable experiences.

That being said, Elden Ring is not a game for the faint of heart. Its punishing difficulty and unforgiving combat mechanics will test your skills and patience to their limits. There will be moments where you'll want to hurl your controller across the room in frustration. Yet, there's a strange satisfaction that comes from overcoming these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, fueling your determination to press on.

For fans of the Souls-like genre and those who appreciate moody atmospheres and rich storytelling, Elden Ring is a must-play. It's a dark and maddening journey that will push you to your limits but rewards perseverance with moments of sheer triumph. Just be prepared to rage, quit, and then find yourself inexplicably drawn back for more.
I've never been a person that could replay games. I just don't get the same enjoyment from them, but I don't know what it is that keeps bringing me back to Elden Ring. I love it so much
:3

The game is not that great to be honest. The PC controller are kinda messed up and the community attacks you for not using console. But I love this game because of the lore.

men what can I say
immaculate
Oh mimic tear, become my saviour once more
Great Game
I seriously cannot get enough of this game and i would call it my first real souls game 
It feels extremely rewarding being able to do whatever i want whenever i want and its always worth it
exploring is always beneficial and i really love going everywhere and picking everything up and just playing at my own pace which this game lets you do ever so gently 

Currently doing some shenanigans with a randomizer and gosh it makes the game feel so fresh again even after beating it fairly recently 

This game straight up is one of my favourite games of all time! its ALMOST perfect..
the crafting is straight up bloated with the amount of craft books and i love being able to add crafting pots and tipped arrows to my arsenal but being blocked behind not having Nomadic cookbook [23] is pretty annoying. the perfumer items also suffer. ask for a lot in both the quality of items and quantity with the cherry on top that certain items are finite.. But honestly it can be the most dogshit crafting system on the planet and this would still be a banger game

  Love it LOTS

Simply a masterpiece
Easily the greatest game ever made. I've had it on Xbox and now I am enjoying it on PC
You have already heard how amazing this game is. Just buy it.

fire giant can suck my giant fucking throbbing veiny horse cock and shove that stupid ass fucking shield up his loose homosexual asshole, i fucking hate that boss fight
duh
Dog

hooolalalallaa
NIHIIILLLL!!!!

This is the best video game Ive ever played. Really interesting story too.

Very nice
ok

Joey doesnt share runes
BOMBA

It's like dark souls except you dont really have to be that good at the game you just need enough hugemongous swords and one of them will probably beat the guy. Pretty also.
fun
melina segs
First off if you're new to Souls game this is probably your way in but the Souls cycle continues these games are not fun until you get good. I brought dark souls 3 played it beat my first boos then hit a wall an hour it didn't touch it for a couple of years played it again and have since played every Soulsborne game there is. This will happen to you you will have the feeling to give up push on and I guarantee this will be in your top 10 games of all time once beaten. 
Quick breakdown in reference to DS3:
story 7/10 ds3 9/10
bosses 9/10 ds3 10/10
gameplay 10/10 ds3 8/10
replayability 9/10 ds3 7/10
level design 9/10 ds3 9/10
Overall 9/10 could get to 10/10 with DLC
sheeee amazeballs
Game is great, i finally finished the first boss
why is it always dog?

Horrible game do not buy if you are not an enjoyer of good times, otherwise buy this game PLEASE its such a masterpiece and I do not know how you can get better than this.
Awsome
Best game
Pros:
¬∑ Beautiful art and world design, great views from almost any point of the map
¬∑ Massive map with a lot of areas to to explore
¬∑ 300+ weapons and 100+ unique abilities for them, over 100 incantations and 70 spells
¬∑ All weapon types have a distinct feel to them which keeps the game fresh over multiple playthroughs
¬∑ Most enemies are fun to fight and have a natural rhythm to them
¬∑ Updated game engine improves upon Dark Souls 3 with more consistent physics
¬∑ The horse given to the player early on is iconic and enjoyable to use
¬∑ Excellent sound track
¬∑ Each subcontinent (Limgrave, Liurnia etc) feels unique and has its own atmosphere
¬∑ Some great memorable bosses with quotable lines and unique visual design
¬∑ Most freedom in the series, the player can reach a huge amount of the game's map from the beginning
¬∑ Possibly the best character creation yet with seemingly limitless facial shape combinations
¬∑ Simple and effective UI
¬∑ Compelling side characters and 6 possible endings, with 2 of them being unique
¬∑ No pointless developer hand-holding - you start the game and do what you want

Cons:
¬∑ Huge difficulty spike after the game's midpoint that can make late-game combat tedious
¬∑ Map is so large you will often miss npc questlines, items, dungeons and bosses without searching online 
¬∑ Most of the bosses in the game (outside of remembrance) are repurposed normal enemies
¬∑ Most of the remembrance bosses do not have fun fighting mechanics, choosing style over substance
¬∑ Backstory and lore are by far the worst and most convoluted in the series
¬∑ The late-game areas do not have as nearly as much content as the earlier ones
¬∑ Plenty of obnoxious enemies with bad hitboxes and high stagger resistance (esp. Caelid and Mountaintops)
¬∑ Most late-game enemies are repurposed from early and mid-game
¬∑ Not as many good-looking or memorable armour sets as in the other soulsbournes
¬∑ Second phase of the final boss is an abomination and ruins the great atmosphere set by the first phase
¬∑ 4 of the 6 possible endings are almost exactly the same, the only difference being the background colour
¬∑ Finding weapon upgrade materials is a chore if it requires regular smithing stones and not somber ones
hONESTLY... This might be the best game ive played in many years... i wasnt too sure cuz the git gud community of the souls games seemed very jarring and toxic... but the game quickly grew on me and got a lot of replay value... i dont usually replay games but this one ive finished 4 times already with different builds
made me feel things. not good things, but things
If you like to challenge yourself and fight epic battles of blood and death. I recommend it.
It aight
This was the first from software game i have played where i got a chance to play it on launch and engage with the community during my first play through. Elden ring is my favorite game of all time and ill probably come back again and again for years to come.

A deserved GOTY.
great game
It's the most approachable Fromsoft Souls-like with an insane amount of content and quality
good :).
One of the best games of all time.
its ok ig 9/10
dark souls, but open world
So much game, so little time, so many deaths
Do be a good game
wd
game fucking infuriates me to my core
Very fun
Don't buy unless you plan on going down a rabbit hole you will never be able too escape. Think of the game as gambling you'll never get tired of it
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH" - Godrick the grafted
oonga boonga
queen marika jiggle physics
sick as hell
too easy

S tier game, must play!
This game made me racist as fuck, I decided to beat my dick every time i died, 8509 jerks later, here I am
i will never play as a black elden ring character. ps godrick is jewish
Great game all around.
It is difficult, the biggest thing is not knowing whats around the next corner and getting bonked several times till you realize oh ya i should probably go somewhere else till i get stronger. If you are bad at timing dodges and that kind of thing you might find the game hard as well.

The important thing is to remain calm. just ignore the shouting you hear from somewhere in the western hemisphere. lol
Best game I've played in years 10/10
goated

You won't regret playing this game (until you face Malenia), but when you beat her it will be the most exhilarating time of your life.
squidward-"erm what the sigma"
Most overrated game I have ever played literally people who think this is a good game are mentally ill. Nothing about this game is good except the art and the world of the game other than that the game is trash.
10/10 would recommend, life changing and the greatest experience of all time. this is more difficult and takes longer to beat than fromsoftware games and the plot is so good it made me cry thousands of times and had me feeling supreme rage against all sorts of enemies and after putting on so many hours i could feel myself as a changed man. im now 6'4, my hair cut itself and mogs, my jawline mogs everyone so hard it can now cut through the hardest of bedrocks, my wee wee has the ability to solo goku and my hands can now one tap sleeping dragon.
this game is perfection
Open-world Dark Souls 4
game sux
Rings that are elder
Easily one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay, presentation, lore, and exploration. I would recommend this game to anyone.
i didnt play souls games before this.. finally made it to final boss.. if i can do it you can too. its fun
Emboldened by the flames of ambition
definitely
it sucks they ruined my SOULS GAMES. "Oh daku soru is so known for being so difficult SO WE NEED TO TURN UP THE DIFFICULTY OKAY GUYS?!?! WE NEED TO ADD 10 HIT CHAIN COMBO WHERE THE PLAYER ONLY HAS A SMALL GAP WHERE THEY CAN SWING ONLY ONCE BEFORE ANOTHER 20 HIT COMBO BEGINS. ALSO ADD UNNATURAL DELAYS TO THE BOSSES ATTACKS SO THEY CAN ROLL CATCH WHEN PEOPLE PANIC ROLL. HOW ABOUT ALSO, WHEN A PLAYER DECIDES TO USE A ITEM OR HEAL OR SOMETHING WHATEVER WE MAKE THE BOSS JUST READ THE INPUT AND PUNISH THE PLAYER! THAT'D BE COOL. ALSO, HOW ABOUT WE MAKE INVADERS SUFFER EVEN MORE?? WE NEED TO APPEAL TO CASUALS GUYS. DARK SOULS 3 AND SEKIRO HAS SLOWLY BEEN MAKING US REACH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND NOW THAT THIS GAME IS OPEN WORLD WE WILL HAVE SO MANYYYY NEW PLAYERS COOONSOOOMING "OH WOW IT'S LIKE BREATH OF THE WILD BUT DARK SOUSL EDITION" HAHAHAHAH WE WILL BE SO RICH. HOW ABOUT WE ALSO CHANGE UP THE PVP FORMULA FROM HOW IT WAS FROM DS3 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PERFECTED, AND JUST MAKE IT BADDDD. RAPIERS AND THRUSTING ATTACKES IN GENERAL WILL RULE THE META IT WILL BE SO GOOOOOOOOD
huge potential for replay
i can punch people good. cool  game thank you!

From the moment you step into the Lands Between, you're immersed in a world teeming with breathtaking landscapes, haunting ruins, and formidable adversaries. The sheer scale of the environment is awe-inspiring, inviting exploration at every turn. From desolate plains to towering castles and ethereal forests, each location feels distinct and alive, enriched with secrets waiting to be uncovered.

The combat in Elden Ring is where the game truly shines. It strikes a perfect balance between methodical strategy and intense action, offering players a wide array of weapons, magic, and abilities to unleash upon their foes. Every encounter feels like a high-stakes duel, demanding precision, timing, and adaptability. Whether facing off against towering bosses or battling hordes of lesser enemies, the exhilaration of victory is unmatched.

One of Elden Ring's greatest strengths lies in its storytelling. George R. R. Martin's influence is evident in the rich lore and intricate world-building woven throughout the game. From enigmatic NPCs to cryptic item descriptions, every detail serves to deepen the sense of immersion and intrigue. The narrative unfolds organically, rewarding players who take the time to piece together the fragments of the past.


killed fake dragon to show who real dragon is mwhaahahhahahahahaha roooaaaaaarr
kill, run, die... repeat
nice
amazing
Chicken Farm 10/10
Do it

I HATE RATS. very fun game
Love the game, the first time i played , i don't even go though any story, just explore around the world, it's fantastic.
goodd

Finger but hole
Honestly one of the best games ive ever played, Multiple endings and amazing soundtrack. Even the bosses that took me an absurd amount of time, (malenia took me 2 days) but it was some of the best time ive had playing a game and the reward is like no other.
Smaller file size than the new Star Wars Battlefront Collection
GOAT
Greatest game of all times
This review was written in summer of 2022: 

There is nothing to not enjoy this game if you are one who does not give up easily. I started playing Elden Ring on my laptop which every systems requirements website said could not run it. I played it on the lowest graphics settings with one of the lowest resolutions possible in windowed mode. I still had an immense amount of fun. Is this game hard: yes. Are some of the boss movesets seemingly unfair: yes ahem Waterfowl Dance ahem. But, this game is still enjoyable. 
This is my first From Soft game, and it was intense. The only game that I could consider similar to this that I have played is Nioh, which I also completed base game on. The best piece of advice that I could give to anybody wishing to play this game is that if you don't completely give up, you will "git gud." The learning curve in this game is insane, and if you start NG+ or play on another account after beating the game once, that tutorial boss isn't so hard anymore. 
All in all, this is a great game, possibly the greatest game that I have personally played, and likely the greatest game to be released in this year.
it's very funny  it really  gives  me  a  lot of  happiness
great

Good
No words can describe how fun this game is!
Good game didnt rage

greatest game ever made
—Ä–∞–¥–∞–Ω –ª–æ—Ö
yeah
After 117 hours of gaming i finally completed the hole game. This game was a banger. I had tons of fun and i will be looking forward for the DLC. If its to hard just get good.

SIMP FOR Ranni !!!
Its simply the best
buy it. fromsoft went brrr on this one
its pretty good
No Block. Only Roll.
ballz
enjoying it so far. love it so far will give a much better review as i delve deeper, but thus far i have no regurts spending 100 bucks on a souls game lol
to hard :( couldnt beat margaret
no, bosses are too hard and I hate knights in general they make me so angry >:C jk
Prepare to Cry Ye Tarnished!
Alot easier for new souls players to feel their natural progression and the freedom to literally choose every battle.
I PLAYED MORE ON MY PS5 AND STILL LOVE THIS GAME
amazingly gud
gud game
Ranni... thats all i have to say
i luh eldin ring cuh
I mean, it's Elden Ring
Goated
This game is a masterpiece of the souls like genre, as FromSoftware yet again pushes the boundaries of how good a game can be. This game is more than worth the $60, it is worth way more. With the upcoming 'Shadow of the Erdtree' DLC even more content will be added. This is a great first souls game to play as there are many ways the game assists the player such as spirit summons, NPC summons, and online coop in order to help players. The vast open world of the Lands Between is something to marvel at, it is a beautiful game.
YOU CAN ELDEN THE RING üíç

i hope whoever worked on Giants Mountaintop Catcacombs gets castrated
dog
Amazing game, poor balancing. Magic is so broken I had an easier time killing the Fire Giant with fire than with a strength build.
AMAZING GRAPHICS
ummm the game just gave me a double jumping horse?? how massive is this game??
10/10 would burn the world again
good game
i like big iron stick
After finally getting all achievements and a few hundred hours of playtime, its fair to say I have a pretty solid view on this game.
It's simultaneously an incredible experience and a fucking nightmare, genuinely poorly designed and horribly balanced. 
It's pretty goated though
t
i put this game over my wife my wife hates me i love elden ring
soldier of godrick was too hard
not fun
first time playing and really enjoy the difficulty and gameplay
This is easily the worst SoulsBourne that has been released in the last decade. I can't imagine putting even an afternoon of time into this pile of stun spamming filth, and better yet, I could easily exclaim that this is no where near the masterpiece that Nioh 2 was.
Ouchie!! Painful game that hates humans. Agghhhhrrrrrrr!!!!
First time playing the game, or any style game like this. Had to refund only an hour into it cus it was so clunky during combat, the delay after an attack was insane and i couldn't do anything if there was more then one enemy - the horse ridder at the start is to OP so swung around him efter getting clapped twice, then the group of knights or w.e. then proceeded to storm me 4-5 man (even after sneaking around killing 3 in advance) at once, so i had no chance to do anything.. 
- had a feeling that it would keep on being like this, so ye, i refunded the game.. 60euro to get clapped n frustrated at once = no thx lol. 

- Game looks sick tho hence me wanting to play it. Wish there was a way to chance the difficulty.
yes
everything about this game is really good
you just go and bonk everything
Unworthy are we tarnished of such grace of gold...
easily 1st or 2nd best game of all time
Tried fingers but hole

10/10
peak gaming

Seriously why buy any other game when this keeps me entertained for hundreds of hours?
10/10 Certified masterpiece.

Just awesome
The peak of human culture, it all goes downhill from here
Best Game Ever
"Put these foolish ambitions to rest" is literally burned in my ears
Cool game
Mogger game
im no souls player. tried one title but wasnt for me. this however is different. it can be frustrating, yes. but due to the openworld there is always something else to do to not get stuck, the artstyle is phenomenoly good. also the leveldesign is really really good. two thumps up
Good game and remember: if you die its always the games fault

One of the best games ever made.
I am no longer maidenless
poop
Keeps me sane
Wonderful game. ive played it for too long for my own good.so berseky and just a buityful game overall. the scenery is so cool, and the bosses are super different. 100% recomended, for anyone. anyone can get through it, it will be difficult, but anyone can do it.
Great times ahead!
this game is a stupid waste of money U should buy it
0 easy modes 0 microtransactions 7 ITS MID
Excellent game! One of the best!
Oh, Elden Ring, my beloved. Where do I even begin? Your awe striking sights, your expertly hand crafted combat, and of course, I can't forget your animation reading bosses. Oh, my dear Elden Ring, how I love you so, so much. I can't bear to be apart from you. I cannot live with the thought that some day I will kiss you for the last time. So, Elden Ring, will you marry me? Will you be with me from now until the DLC drops? Oh, Elden Ring, you truly are my everything.
It's a very beautiful nightmare

Second after Sekiro best soulslike game
pika
Just getting started...
Very relaxing game
This game is super easy, recommended to people who are new to gaming. If you are dying too many times, just get better :D
brutal, yet beautiful
I try so hard, still ded wtf
One the best games I have ever played...
That first week at Lands between.
i like this game too it is good
Don't talk to me if you don't have this game
Good game, but not for everyone. The Souls style combat is at its best in a highly curated, tightly knit environment which, by the nature of an open world, is not possible here. While the attempt at something different is appreciated and adds a lot to the table, I don't think it was executed upon well enough to merit the praise I see Elden Ring receive. I'd even argue that the open world could be cut in half to better effect. It gets incredibly samey, mind numbingly so. You'll be wandering eerily similar caves and tombs for 30% of your experience, fighting the same bosses and enemies copied and pasted time and time again; Elden Ring really doesn't feel like it has respect for your time. I've played and replayed every Souls game, countless times. DS1 specifically is well into the hundreds of playthroughs. But when I came back to Elden Ring with a fresh save to prepare for the upcoming DLC, I simply couldn't stomach the redundancy of this slow burning open world.
GG
why even work anymore
Best solo player game ive ever played until i got to fire giant......... thats where the pain started
great the best game u will ever play in ur worthless life... jk
Great game, will suck you in.
my favourite part was when godrick said "its grafting time!" and grafted all over the place
A really solid game despite it's jank. Lot of content to experience and secrets to stumble upon.
One of the best gaming experiences money can buy
i've purchased but i must purchased again?
an italian poet once said : grazie ar caz-zo che √® goty
good

great game
First time playing soul game, glad this is my first
Nothing to say that hasn't been said already, it brings back the childhood feeling of getting lost in a game for hours as you lose the sense of time.
The only thing i didn't like personally is the long walk backs to some boss rooms (like most dark souls). I don't mind fighting a boss many times, i quite enjoy it, but a long walk back makes me want to cheese the boss.
This is my second playthrough since it was first released on PS5. This game is one of the best games to ever be released in HISTORY 10/10
its not super amaizng game just like ds 3/5 not a new game like sekiro or bloodborn
yes
goog ame
good
Fun until you fight a boss, no I dont like waiting 10 min just to get 2 hits and then wait another 10 min
Definitely the greatest game of all time.
try fingers but hole
Came for Millicent Stayed cause Dung Eater 12/10 (Exploration Make Me Confused)
Pretty good game and pretty fun.
Elden Ring - A Masterpiece in Gaming

Elden Ring is not just a game; it's an experience unlike any other. As a seasoned gamer, I've traversed countless virtual worlds, but none have left me as mesmerized and captivated as Elden Ring. From the moment I delved into its richly crafted universe, I was immersed in a breathtaking journey that seamlessly blended awe-inspiring landscapes, gripping lore, and exhilarating gameplay.

One of the standout features of Elden Ring is its vast open world, which feels alive and teeming with secrets waiting to be discovered. Every corner is meticulously designed, from towering castles to sprawling plains, each with its own story to tell. The sense of freedom to explore this expansive world is unparalleled, offering endless opportunities for exploration and adventure.

But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its challenging yet rewarding gameplay. From epic boss battles to tense encounters with formidable foes, every moment is a test of skill and strategy. The combat mechanics are fluid and responsive, requiring careful timing and precision to emerge victorious. And with a wide array of weapons, spells, and abilities at your disposal, each encounter feels fresh and exhilarating.

Beyond its gameplay, Elden Ring also boasts a rich and immersive narrative, steeped in myth and mystery. The lore of the world is deep and intricately woven, inviting players to uncover its secrets through exploration and discovery. From ancient ruins to enigmatic NPCs, there's always something new to uncover, keeping you engaged and invested in the world around you.

Visually, Elden Ring is a masterpiece, with stunning graphics and breathtaking vistas that truly bring its world to life. From the haunting beauty of the night sky to the eerie depths of the dungeons, every detail is meticulously crafted, immersing you in a world of unparalleled beauty and danger.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is not just a game; it's a masterpiece of gaming. With its vast open world, challenging gameplay, and rich narrative, it sets a new standard for what a video game can achieve. It's a journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll, and one that I wholeheartedly recommend to any gamer seeking adventure, challenge, and immersion.

Very nice game! :D
I finally found something that brings me a bit of joy again.
Pros: 
+Weapon arts are awesome and make you feel like a badass. 
+Magic (sorceries) are fun. 
+Status effects can be inflicted on enemies and is not only a valid way of attacking, it's one of the strongest. 
+You can eat the heart of dragons to become stronger. 
+A massive sprawling area to explore. 
+Like...three-four ish chicks to simp over. which is triple what Dark Souls usually gets. 
+Not all quests follow the Dark Souls dogma of being extremely depressing by the end of it. 
+Lots of possible endings. 
+"I am Malenia, blade of Miquella."
Cons:
-Vigor actually matters a lot in this game. Something that will feel weird to most Dark Souls players. 
-Area scaling can get a bit much at times. Mostly the end game areas, but still. 
-Some areas/quests are near impossible to complete without a guide. For example, there's one where you have to sit at a very specific bonfire that isn't really explained at all. Don't get me wrong, exploring as much as possible will net you a good chunk of secrets from the game, but some of them are just too well hidden.
-"I am Malenia, blade of Miquella."

shadows of the ERDTREEEEE
this game is very important to me and has some of the most magical moments in any video game ever. the difficulty can be tuned to how you want it, without a direct easy, medium or hard mode. if you want an easier experience, you can use things like magic, summons, or OP weapons. if you want a hard experience, it will deliver and exceed in that area as well. not to mention the graphics and the beautiful atmosphere that never fails to make my DICK HARD AS FUCK. overall, if you haven't already had the chance to play this game, it will change the way you think about video games and how they are meant to be played and designed.

Great game to wanna hate yourself more then you already do......... 10/10 would do another play though...
what a game
The magic aim and camera is so atrocious in this game that it ruins every other facet in what otherwise would be a beautiful, cinematic, and aesthetic masterpiece.
I'm an older woman, and I find that this game appeals to all ages. I have sooo many hours into this game and I love it. I admit I need my sons help and his friends to get me through things sometimes when it's a monster that's kicking my butt. I'm now at the stage where I can do it on my own. I think they did an amazing job with this game. It doesn't matter how old you are, this is so fun. I highly recommend this game. Thanks for doing such a great job with this game.
Legendary game.
frick man i m so happy i got this game

Hated it at first, but then I stopped trying to rush through bosses and took time to explore the world and absolutely fell in love with it. I remember think that the world was to open and I could never find anything and that there wasn't really a set place where you should go, then a friend told me about the site of grace arrows :/ i am dumb.

Good game
Fun Game!
Cool

Good Game :)
This is such  a beautiful game and a huge mystery the whole way thru. its just a little to hard so i bought on steam so i could mod it to be easier. i wish it had a easier mode on Xbox but i love the story and graphics and huge world so i bought it twice so i could mod it to be a lil easier

Always stuttering. No matter how many fixes I try, It works for 10 minutes then I stutter. Even worse when I have to fight a boss. Great game. Not on this platform
Simping for Melina is good enough for me, you need only touch her hand for but a moment.

really awesome game, but you need a strong soul (lol get it) to play it and have fun. i have died hundreds if not thousands of times, and I'm only 100 hours in. past that, the graphics are the best I have ever seen, and just so nice to play. huge world with a bunch of unique areas, it will take forever to find every site of grace.
when melina asked the tarnished, "What would happen if you fought malenia?" The tarnished answered, "If I was at level 90, she might give me a little trouble." "But would you lose?" "Nah, I'd roll."
s
Game is pretty fun until you get half way through the game, then its just beyond frustrating for the average player, not that you cant beat it, but it becomes a wtf is this compared to the first half

THE BEST!
banished knight greatsword
its hard
do it
It do be a good game
i cast rock
So fun, love love love.
Game of the year 2013
THE ELDEN RING IS REAL!!!!
One of the best games I've ever played.
I mean it's bloody elden ring... Getting into souls-like game has never been easier, seriously.
roll button
Nice
the game throws you some bosses with questionable fucking hitboxes by the end of the game, they are doable but fuck me they're unfair and makes the game bs.
Yes
I don't really like souls-like games.

I'm pretty picky about RPGs these days.

This is one of the greatest games I've ever played (and probably will play) in my life. Absolute masterpiece.
Masterpiece
Dosent work :(
:D
I wish more games had an invasion system. One of my favorite parts of the game is to enter another player's world and do the best I can to eliminate the host and their phantoms.
100% game, still no maidens
Holy sh*t fromsoft really out-fromsofted themselves on this

ranni top tier mommy
A game so good I clocked in 380 hours on my PS5 and bought it again on Steam and clocked another 140 hours (at the time of writing this review - Shadow or the Erdtree will push those hours up).

This game is astonishing in size and scope, the map is massive without being overwhelming and there are secrets squirrelled away everywhere. The world size is huge but I think one of the reasons the map isn't daunting is that fast travel sites of grace are plentiful and also that the map is not littered with icons - you get to place your own markers on the map. As you play the map just keeps getting bigger and bigger yet never becomes overwhelming for the reasons noted above. 

This was a joy and provided a real sense of discovery and wonder that I hadn't realise was missing from my open world experience up until I played this game. 

Combat is tight and feels fair for the most part although I avoid Rune Bears because they are ludicrously fast for their size and hit like a truck. The only real part of the game that can be not fun is actually the fight with final boss, the Elden Beast. If RnG doesn't play fair then it runs away constantly, which can make this fight a bit tedious rather than fun - the Radagon half of the fight is very fun mind you.

Anyway, this is one of my favourite games of all time alongside Bloodborne, Nioh and Baldurs Gate 3.

Elden Ring
My favorite part was when the Elden Ring said "I'm the Elden RIng"
This game is absolutely worth your time and your money. 
It is a brilliant game and was one of my favorite from the first hour of gameplay, now on New Game+ I think it's time for me to take a few minutes to tell you why I love it so much.
Yeah you're gonna die a lot, and the game is quick to teach you that you can't just expect to win every battle, but death is a setback, not a failure, and while there's no conventional "easy mode", the game gives you a ton of options to make your journey in the lands between easier, such as spirit summons or powerful sorceries, making it very accessible for players new to souls-like games (such as myself). 
In addition, if you do your homework and learn about the advanced mechanics of the game, like buff-stacking, you can easily get incredibly overpowered and stomp on even the hardest of skill-check bosses without breaking a sweat.
The music is incredible to does a lot to add grandeur to the environments and glory to the boss fights. The environments are stunning and really invite the player to explore the world and see what this diverse world has to offer. The graphics, while not at the top of what this generation has to offer, are saved by an incredible art style and artistic direction.
The friendly NPCs are well written and all have their own story and personality, the story really feels organic and the player does feel involved from start to finish, mostly due to the player needing to piece together details themselves to truly understand the world, making it feel like you're actually living it rather than reading it in a quest log.
The absence of a conventional easy mode creates a shared experience between players. If you struggled on a boss, you know millions of players before you did as well. Moreover, multiplayer mechanics like messages and bloodstains add to this experience by creating a sense of community and mutual aid that is really helping you get the determination necessary to overcome every hardships you might face. 

Now for the (few) cons, the game often has some stuttering issues, especially on low spec hardware, which can be quite irritating if it happens during a tense moment. 
Quests can be hard to complete without looking them up on a wiki, as it's quite easy to miss a step or lose track of NPCs. And although you're not supposed to finish them all in a single playthrough (to be fair it's already quite the achievement if you finished a single one without a guide), it can rebuke some players who might not want to put the hours to do multiple playthrough of the game.
Especially given the open world nature of the game, which kinda hurts the replayability, needing a lot of running around grabbing materials and items to get back on track on a new save file. This is mitigated however, by the fact that most items do stay in your inventory on NG+, sparing you the hassle of running errands before actually playing the game.
Also fuck that torrent resummon dialog box, i lost count the number of times i died because of it lmao.

TL;DR: Play this game, it's good :3
target camera makes me want to jump off a bridge. if an enemy does an attack that moves the enemy around a lot, the target camera swiftly follows it. this usually leads me to roll *INTO* the attack. i need to use the target camera for my character to face the enemy at all times.

and now i can't even refund the game because it took half my playtime just to reach combat of any kind, so the time it took for me to decide if i like it or not put me over the threshold.
Ta bn
fun game
Is good game
o ya
hey man it's no dark souls 1 or anything but its pretty good. better than dark souls 3 anyway
Git Gud
if you want to get sucked into a beautiful masterpiece just to get your ass handed to you harder than the Australians in the emu war, than this is for you.
Its basically just the best of all the soulsborne games and then a lot of it. First playthrough on ps5 was 200hrs. if you havent played any of the soulsborne games, think of it like this. If skyrim is a nice herbal tea, elden ring is black tar heroin.
Tarnished Simulator kinda hitting hard ngl

Its a great game, but the pvp is way too easy they need to increase the difficulty on the other players
i love u
Top 10 of all time
i hate fire giant
I am Elden ring
great game decent difficulty with ways to always circumnavigate it
Probably the best FromSoft game up until now. Open World is well implemented and the game world feels alive. Bosses are difficult but feel fair and satisfying to beat (with a couple exceptions). All in all amazing game.
Best game ever made.
absolutely amazing

game is dogshit, boss hit boxes broken, input lag, overall a badly optimized game that ppl love to talk up cuz it's "hard"
Dark souls 3 but open world

Intimidating at first, but after [i] gitting gud [/i] I couldn't [i] *git [/i] enough of this game. Excited for the DLC.
i wasnt realy into soulsgames.. but holy fuq this game got me and now im in my third playthrough. clear recommendation for anyone looking for a challenge
and if u want to play with friends, seamless-coop is a realy good mod and easy to use.

Im new to Souls games, Elden Ring being my first. While having a rough start, its worth the time. Improve your skills as a gamer. Suggest having a mouse with extra buttons.
If you haven't  played this game then you have played nothing, it is difficult but fun and its difficulty is what makes it fun you can be what you choose who you wanna be  and do what you wanna do. The story line, graphics, boss fights and everything id top notch. Loving it so far.
This game is crazy
it's good

Life Changing Game.
Thank god that I memorised attack patterns of my baba's papuƒça or else I would be cooked in this game.
Difficult. You have to never give up but once you beat that boss you cant beat it feels so good. definetly worth it
Fun game.

The best souls game I've ever played in my life
I am a 41-year-old single father to my 11-year-old son. When my son received this game as a Christmas gift from his uncle, he became engrossed in the game, racking up 24 hours of playtime in just one week. This concerned me, as I was already struggling to find quality time to spend with my son between his friends and YouTube. To connect with my son through his interest, I created a Steam account and purchased this game. Although I was initially confused by the gameplay, my son graciously hosted a game for me to join. I loved the experience - it was the most meaningful time we had shared since the passing of my wife. Gaming has brought my son and me closer, and we now spend more time together outside of the house as well.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece.
Finished the game in 100 hrs with completing all achievements. great game and there's still so much into it. probably my most fav one after bloodborne and DS3
Dude it's elden ring, just get it
she be elden on my ring
I'm Malenia blade of Miquella
cool
FUN SLASH SLASH
elden ring is a great fun game. it takes countless hours of learning mechanics to have alot of fun tho. and your prolly going to die and lose souls more then a few times. pve content is best people have unique pve builds and its fun to play around with friends. pvp is ruined as it is in the entire souls franchise people who invade in this game all use the same 1 of 4 set ups with the highest chances of success vs fun and uniqueness. so look out for all the fat man super posie dual weapon chargers that will come and spam you. also look out for the blood loss trap 1 shooters. like i said pvp is very lame. so have fun enjoy the pve content and make whatever character you can think of in elden ring. < im currently rocking tiamat from Dungeons and dragons and its pretty unique build.
very hard but it is a really fun and exciting game
Words that I never thought I'd say.
I recommend this game.
I'm actually enjoying the time I'm spending in this game.
Fudge...
Try fingers
Game is good
As a left handed play my hand is all over the keyboard due to hard bound keys, it's 2024, why is this still an issue? This has been out now for 2 years and it's not fixed.

Absolutely yes !

Live, Love, Elden Ring
This game is a masterpiece. 11/10. Literally nothing more needs to be said.
First Souls-like, it was a great journey. Would highly recommend play the game!
I seldom play action game. Only MHW and this successfully hooked me for sleepless hours.
good gamüëç

It is harder than most of the games and invasions are annoying but you can turn it off and game is still hard enough to enjoy :)

Oh, I must be a blacksmith... Now, let's get smithing.
amazing game
Yeah Finally killed the tutorial boss! 

It's a from software game.
Words cannot describe what this game means to me.

I have Elden Ring Merch, the Elden Ring main theme as my morning alarm, and I'm 150hrs (200hrs overall) in on my main character and haven't even unlocked the entire world yet or completed the game.

Sure its punishing at the beginning but as soon as you start to understand how the game expects you to play, it gets easier and easier as your character gets stronger and stronger.

Such an incredible game with a magical world and endless content.

The only critique is the lack of a quest log makes the side quests REALLY hard to track.

Hopefully they add this in the DLC...
I now have a doctorate in elden ring the game.

but i play like dr.death performing surgery

do not be afraid, just be perfect.
first souls game i really addicted , can't stop playing this game. Madness for some reason ;p
RANNI!!!!!!!
damn
Mind blown.
Some bitch called Mayonnaise showed up and called me maidenless 10/10.
An actual game that gives a damn. It provides a story for those interested, and a gameplay that is so replayable they give you infinite NG+... FromSoft knows how to make them. Support businesses that care about the medium. Pay full price for this beauty and don't look back.
Fantastic world-building, endless lore, incredible characters, challenging but engaging combat, absolutely gorgeous visuals - what's not to like? One of my favourite games of all time.
It does not make me sleepy
amazing game
Inb4 salty fan boys get on my n uts, I'll preface this with: we are not dedicated or hardcore souls players.

   Bought it with a friend mostly with the intent to play co-op, and found out the hard way that it is absolute dumpster juice in that aspect. Basically a pointless addition to the game, we were willing to work around the fact that it's mostly for assistance in boss fights except for the fact we kept getting invaded by NPCs (or I assume since it was always the same name) we couldn't hit as soon as we joined on each other. So if you expect to play with a friend, don't even bother. Gameplay is solid, usual DS gameplay and all that. Might get it again on a sale or something, but for now I'm more annoyed than impressed. Buy it if you only intend to play single player entirely because they clearly do not want you playing cooperatively even though it's in the game.
Literally game of goat
a wise man once said "try finger but hole" -Sun Tzu the art of funny
replayable as hell
One of the best games I've ever played. It has its issues, as every game does, but I seriously regret not getting into sooner. Unreal music, the entire game is beautifully cinematic, and most of the boss fights are intuitive and challenging, while not feeling unfair. 

This one's a 10/10 and it's seriously not even close
EZ game
Good
played 101 hours and still haven't beaten
Good hole now

almost 300 hours and still discovering new things.. in short this game is a masterpiece

Miyazaki has had years to find a way to be innovative, but he seems to be stuck in the past. It seems every other franchise has evolved, but this one. Controls are still as clunky, unresponsive, and broken as all other installments. With next to zero accessibility options, (and I'm not talking about difficulty sliders). Role delay due to sprint and dodge being mapped to the same button, with no way to separate them through changing the bindings. Most other controls feel unresponsive at times. Also, for some reason, it seems they haven't enabled omnidirectional rolling when locked on, so you have to decide between being able to roll away from the boss (not locked on) or being able to hit the boss (locked on). Also when locked on when using a spear it just won't hit the enemy sometimes, it will stab where they were 5 seconds ago. The game studders heavily during the open-world segments, which make up a majority of the game. Delayed attacks and gank fights do not make the game more difficult, they ruin the combat flow and experience, so why does it seem that everyone needs them according to FromSoft? The PC port is also really bad and unoptimized, for keyboard and mouse, but whatever, just buy a controller to use. 

The art style, graphics, and spectacle of the game are beautiful, but it's ruined by the emptiness and repetitiveness of the world. You'll go to an eye-catching location on the map, just to realize there is nothing but reused bosses and poorly designed catacombs, which end up more akin to the Chalice Dungeons of Bloodborne. Even if you do decide to crawl your way through the copy-and-pasted catacombs and locations, all that you are rewarded with is a weapon or spell you can't use. During my first playthrough, I was excited to explore the beautiful world, but after every encounter, I felt my time was wasted, not even enjoying myself doing so. The open world feels barren and unnecessary like FromSoft saw Breath of the Wild do well so now they forced themselves to make it open-world. The map is too big for its own good with nothing filling it out.

The lore of the game is as grand and deep as every other FromSoft game, which is one of the many things I like about them. However, the way the lore and story are delivered to you hasn't changed since Demon Souls. Still, the only way to unravel the story is to rigorously read through the item description of everything in the game. Quests and NPC interactions are confusing, with no discernable way of knowing where to go without a guide. It is very easy to not finish an entire quest just from doing things accidentally out-of-order, in an OPEN-WORLD game. Needing to watch a 36-hour lore video on YouTube just to understand the story makes me question what hiring George R.R. Martin was even for, as his influence is just imperceivable when compared to the stories of past games.

Most bosses were easy except for like one bullshit thing they have that is only meant to get you the very first time you fight them. Melania is an easy, and predictable fight every time, right up until she uses waterfowl, where she requires you to do some bullshit zigzag that needs to be looked up in order to find out (or just use frost pot I guess :3) I have almost 300 hours and have beaten the game 3+ plus times as of this review, so don't take this review as just a person who got stuck on Tree Sentinal or Morgott, and just needs to "get gud" But also don't take this review as me entirely hating the game, I mostly enjoyed my time and I'd say at least 75% of the game is perfect, but it's just that 25% that makes me dread having to do another playthrough.

I forgot to put Torrent up there, so here he is. Riding Torrent on horseback just seems really unfinished, like something is supposed to be there but just never got made. Combat on Torrent is really boring, you just run in a circle pressing mouse 1. If torrent had I-frames or some kind of dodge I feel it would greatly improve that aspect of the game.

Also, PvP exists apparently, it's not that fun. (Meta builds are boring to fight every time I invade or get Invaded)

It's still a really good game and you should go out and play it [or not I don't really care] I just needed a way to express my discontent :) 

Bye-bye

Hated the game, then i kinda liked it. Worth the play.
Just dropping the review since DLC got announced. If you have not heard by this point, it's good as hell. You won't regret it unless you just suck at video games in general.

This game made me addicted to painful losses
There's a lot to like about this, but also a lot not to like.  I have mixed feelings about the open world aspect of the game.  It's a neat idea, but it makes the scaling and boss progression very strange.  The first natural boss that you'd likely run into, Margit, is very tough if you head to him right away, but you can explore the world and become very overpowered and easily overcome challenges that way.  On one hand, it's a really cool concept and you can get some fun exploration out of the game, but on the other hand, it makes playing the game feel a whole lot less natural and balanced than other souls games.  This game is tough to give a thumbs up because of its many gameplay issues, but I suppose I'd do so anyway.

Let's talk about those gameplay issues.  One of my biggest issues is a major issue with the controls: this game has the worst input buffering I've ever seen.  This is another intentional design decision to make the game artificially "harder", but this doesn't make the issue any better.  This game is very notorious for having an input-buffered roll go off *after* your char gets hit and sleeps on the ground for 2 seconds, which can often lead to you getting hit again.  And you better hope you didn't press an attack 3 seconds before the boss starts an attack animation, especially if you're using a slow weapon.

Unfortunately, the boss design is mostly not good.  I don't think this game is especially difficult, mostly because you can explore the world and become way too overpowered for the content you're doing, but they made an obsessive effort to try to make the game harder in an unfun and unfair way.  Most bosses spam their attacks way too often and give you far too few opportunities to respond safely.  The vast majority of bosses in this game have attack sequences where they'll end up dashing away or they go into the next attack too fast so you can't punish properly.  There are also a lot of attacks that bosses *might* do to follow up a previous attack, which makes punishing them a gamble.  For example, Margit does a slow overhead slam with his cane that you can easily punish... unless he pulls out his daggers and slashes you, which he does sometimes.  There's no indication, as far as I can tell, whether he'll do this or not, you're just gambling.

Another issue is that many bosses have some attacks that are far too quick to be fairly dodged.  Using Margit as an example again, those daggers that I mentioned are far too fast to avoid if you're close to him.  It feels like the devs were worried that the open world would let you trivialize content (still does), so they tried to compensate by giving most bosses total BS in a desperate attempt to make the game harder.  Either that, or they're just worried that souls veterans (of which I'm not) are getting too good at the games and so they need to rely on cheap ways to make the game harder.

Compounding this issue, at least for inexperienced players, is the way that poise works in this game.  It's a snowball.  If you're extremely good at getting your hits in where you can (or you can afford to tank boss abilities to get more hits in), then bosses will get stunned relatively easily and you can punish them for big damage.  If the result is stunning a boss, you can afford to be reckless because you won't get punished.  But if you aren't constantly keeping the pressure up, their poise regenerates very fast and you don't make any progress whatsoever.  This makes a huge difference between how most people would experience the game versus how someone with tens of thousands of hours mastering this content would experience the game: either you can make bosses drop like a rock by hitting them a few times, or you are just constantly running away from spam attacks that don't have clear punish windows.

As I've mentioned, since there isn't a linear sequence of boss progression, you can go out of your way to make your char very overpowered to trivialize most content, at least until you get towards the end game and notice a very hard-to-miss spike in difficulty.  But neither side of this experience is very fun to play.  Either content is so trivial that you can easily tank boss abilities and mow them over, or every hit does more than half your hp and you need to deal with constant BS attacks that are too quick to dodge and bosses that relentlessly refuse to let you punish them.  There are some small minority of bosses in this game that feel well designed and fun to play against, but most are not fun.  I think our standards should be higher than this.

She Ranni on my Tarnished till I Elden my Ring
good game i recommend a guide if its your first play through.helps with the initial issue of getting into the game world
Still no Shadow of the Erdtree
Extremely tough game for me, love the challenge and enjoyed the Lore. Already did a playthru before and running thru the game again before the DLC drops.

All I can say is LOCK N LOAD FOLKS !! Prepare yourself !!
One of the hardest and most fun games I've played!!
Palworld is a good game.
very gooder yes roll best very cool üëç
Yuppppppp

awful. Worst in the souls series.
thou don't have the right
fun
The rewards for exploring are magnificent
They put jumping in Dark Souls and accidentally made the greatest game of all time.
it is a amazing game with so much to do. it is a difficult game though but i recommend the challenge
This game is the definition of gaming :)
Best game.
best game ever made
the best game
Hands down the best game I've ever played. It's my first souls game and I was absolutely blown away by the visuals, the lore and the music. Beautiful game! I can't wait for the DLC!
This game keeps saying I have no bishes...... BUT WHERE ARE YOURS!!!
yes
Probably my favorite game.
Its flipping sigma like ohio pluh
Crazy i quited cuz i got lost and didnt bother to look up a walkthrough for the part i was on :( but i recemmed
My foolish ambitions have been put to rest

Daunting but satisfying.
Fun with friends
the amount of things in this game amazes me and the fact a dlc came out with even more content is crazy absolute godlike game!
must play game
ytuyr
painful!
One of the best games ever made. Period.
Best game ever
Best Game I've Played.
Truly one of the Greatest Video Games of All Time. 

This was my first FromSoft game and I can't get enough, I've already started Sekiro and the Dark Souls Trilogy. 

100% buy this, stick with it and once you see that final slain text pop up you will feel a sense of accomplishment you didn't even know possible. 

Let the Grace guide you, Tarnished. Enjoy your time in the lands between!
Great! (doing this so it can stop asking me if I would recommend this game to others)
Great, but you cant marry melina.
wonderful
It is one of the only games I am allowed to bonk everything and everyone I know agrees that it's okay
:(

Good
great game
Amazing game
very hard and game made me want to try and kill myself
yup

prtetty good

Platinumed on Xbox, so I bought it on Steam due to upcoming DLC and new gaming rig. Stutters, when RT is on. Playing on i5-13600k/RTX4070ti super
Heavy stutters when efficiency cores on CPU are enabled. Once disabled via bios, stutters mostly gone. 
For some reason game performes a lot better on laptop with i7-13800H and RTX4060, no stutters during FPS dips
Is good
Foul tarnished... In search of the Elden Ring
good game
While you may not be interested in my review because of my time being quite low compared to others. I assure you that I have around 300 hours on this game across some platforms. I have gotten all the achievements on PC in 40 hours and on XBox in around 100 with 150 hours spent extra. I have beaten the game over 6 times, and I think I now have the knowledge to put together a review. Elden Ring is a game many have praised and I will do the same; it is just brilliant. Everything from the bosses to the world-building, this game has it all. It has charmed me and many others with its great gameplay and if you're still here after this review, I strongly urge you to play this game especially now that the DLC is coming out on June 21st. I legitimately have not pre-ordered anything so fast. Anyway, that was my review of Elden Ring. 
Please buy it if you can.
From, shadowlord0112
Do the Mario
Greatest game ever made, cured my esport fetish.
i hate this game so much
edit: its actually ok if you play as mage
Best game for now and forever
Torrent is definitely the main character.
yess
This is the only game I want to play for the rest of my life
Elden Ring is a fine game that really challenges you at times, but it feels incredibly rewarding as always to complete the game 100% and see all there is to explore

I look a lot forward to the DLC to this game in Summer, May the age of the Erdtree never waver
i suck
Elden Ring is one of the best games i have. From the boss design to the world design i catch myself getting lost in the beauty that is this masterpiece.
The Elden Ring Piece is mine
cool
What needs to be said really.. Rise ye tarnished
Other than Dark Souls 3, this game is probably my favorite despite how frustrating it can be sometimes. Why aren't you playing it? Go! Play it!
yes
As a person who enjoys stories, and the world behind them, this game takes the player to a completely different world in its own. As a FromSoft game, the gameplay is immaculate and polished as ever, and the world building as its first open-world game was well executed and a lovely experience altogether
Legendary Game, buy it! 
Doesn't have to be in sale to be worth it
pls dlc
goated
By FAR my favorite game of all time! Takes the love of Dark Souls, and open-world games, and merges them together to make one of the most flawlessly designed, and impressive games to date. This is a must have for everyone!
gg
Among the FromSoft soulsborne games this was the second one I played (first being Dark Souls 3). At first I didn't know how to feel about the game. After I finished all the soulsborne games (except Demon's Soul, but will play that as well soon) this game grew on me because of it's difficulity, and I love it!
I love it even tho I've barely dipped my toe into the Elden Ring pool! I love exploration and action combat and this has a wealth of both. It's just a tad more difficult than I'm used to, but I'm determined to overcome the challenge so I can see the Erdtree up close!
Best game ever made imo
Cant wait for the DLC, the base game is amazing, now i see why it was game of the year and everyone speaking for this!
Peak
This won game of the year for a reason! Just don't give up and press on!
Great game
Before the mountaintops of giants = 9/10
After the mountaintops of giants = 6-7/10

Before the mountaintops of giants the game is extremely fun to explore, boss fights are omega difficult but rewarding, there are new places that are visually stunning to explore and overall a great experience other than the game randomly dropping from 60fps to 1fps and back to 60fps

After the mountaintops of giants the game becomes tedious with reused enemies and bosses who are no different from before but just deal extra damage while having more hp, the majority of main bosses also just become massive hp sponges with AOE attacks that aren't fun to fight, visually the game is still pretty good but hard to enjoy because of the enemies.

Say "git gud" all you want but i did the game 100% with the help of save reloading to do the endings.
max is fire giant and vee5s gay
pretty ez
amazing fking game. wish i can experience it for the first time again
yes
behold ! old codger but hole
10/10 would buy a third time.
amazing game 10/10
The Greatest
MOHGLESTER #1!!!!
slay
:(
too hard
Best game ever made.
Truly a unique FromSoft masterpiece!
MASTERPIECE ALREADY, IMAGINE WITH DLC
It's pretty alright!
I'm only writing this review because Shadow of the Erdtree was finally announced and I want to go on the record for anyone who never got around to playing it yet for whatever reason. If you heard about the DLC and are thinking "yeah, maybe now is the time I'll finally dive in", then this is directed at you.
Amazing
One of the best games created lately. Wish I could forget all my experience with this game to blindly play it again. Beautiful graphics with some of the best bosses in the franchise, there's a lot of optional stuff between, but you can skip it if it doesn't suit your playstyle and just google a build you want to play.
Overcoming Malenia was really fun.
12/10
Didn't think I would like it as much as the Dark Souls Games at first, but it grew on me.
i liked this game but i have no friends for coop so i spent 90x longer to complete areas
so that was not very nice



There is Drake's penis in the game (Rykard)
I can see why this got GOTY. really just keeps expanding on the Fromsoft formula. I am incredibly excited and also terrified to see how they will continue to push the genre to its absolute limit.
yes
best game of the year material
habit breaker simulator 2022
It's Great

Easy game
Radahn's horse is the strongest NPC
With enough ooga u can booga the very gods
Japanese dev challenge: make a pc port that doesn't stutter or run like shitt [IMPOSSIBLE]
The best game on my personal game list. 
Its hard, but as long as you dont ignore the tutorial windows (like me) you will do good.
Dont rush to the boss and dont thing you can beat everything even if it is in starting area (its soulsborne game after all).
I probably have over 1000 hours of gameplay on this game but its my second profile.
This game is a masterpiece. Highly recommended.
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I had already played hundreds of hours on Xbox before playing on PC but its by far still my favourite game of all time i cant wait for the DLC.
good
its a open world dark souls 3 so if you liked that one you will like this one too
mommy rannalicious
i fucking love this game (i hate playing it)

Masterpiece
I'MMMM SOOO CONFUSEDDDD WTF anyway buy this game :)))))))))))))))

very good game. Ranni = mommy
10/10
i think dis game is very hardings and i cant killings the boss
this game reminds me of sigma
Great game! Can't go wrong with this one!
If you like Dark Souls and like me you are(were) waiting to play it. Don't! Don't wait! 
This is an amazing experience! If you are new to the Souls Series. Play this! 

Though the game is not as difficult as DS3 it does offer much more versatility (alone in movement!). I recommend you go and play DS3 also. But I can imagine you will miss the jump button and your loyal steed. 

Souls game with mounted combat? It works so well!!!!
very skibidi toilet
game rocks dude! TONS of blue 4 armed kisses!!!!!!!
not my favourite game ever and the story made no sense to me but probably the coolest game ive ever played
Great game very hard
Amazing game. Not my favorite but I played with a friend throughout the entire thing and fought every single boss we could. Never had so much fun playing a souls game before in my life.
gudde
Good action, awesome lore.
I'm giving this review on behalf of my mimic tear, but overall pretty good game I would say.
if you like pulling your hair out and hating yourself this is the game to play
Dark Souls 2 2 

Hindsight, parts of the game infuriate me to no end in choice or game design. But how much time I spent in this game and loving every hour of exploring and fighting through it? I can overlook it and even commend some parts of it. Nearly every build is supported ( Faith / Int / Dex / Arcane / STR / Etc) and given the tools to make it happen. But some builds can only work with LATE late game items, so its really just a NG+ gimmick. Open world feels exactly like what the FromSoft formula needed, well MORE open world. Absolutely beautiful game and plenty of ways to approach situations (except the hidden super boss)

9/10 Amazing RPG, 2nd best game next to Dark Souls 2, has some optimization problems on PC but nothing unplayable
W
The game is fun
I bad at this one
phenomenal game
sword game
Great game, but hella hard
first souls game! finished it in two weeks. Game is Biblical, Challenging but that's what I paid for. Hyped for DLC already bought:)
One of the best AAA game out there ... But can't give a positive review to a team who can't add ultra wide screen resolution to a game, it litteraly take probably 5min for them to add the feature its strait garbage will probably never buy any of their game because of that ...
fire top charvas
the sillyness and variety you get with this game is insane, you can challenge yourself in 1000 different ways, different builds , different restrictions, different routes and endings the bosses in just normal elden ring are always challenging and then the mod support for this game is another 1000 hours, im addicted a 900 hours and i keep finding new ways to enjoy this game, its worth your time if you like to challenge yourself.
solid rpg, immersive world, difficult for newcomers to the genre but very rewarding when you learn it. this is my third playthrough though first for the pc version and im still finding new things i havent noticed before.
I'm still maidenless
Great game and a good challenge
best souls like to exist
I like it
I like it
Theres lots to do
offer pickle
BEST GAME EVER MADE!
TLDR this is my first souls experience and my god was it a good one! 

HOLY!  Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim, Elden Ring has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with Elden Ring. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end!

I cannot express my love for the game this was one of the best games i have ever, and will ever play!
cool
Behold Elden Ring! But be wary of addiction... 10/10 can't wait for DLC!
it's a video game
The Foreskin Duo
What even needs to be said? Its good. Really fucking good. Get it
Bosses are rly cool.
not quite dark souls 2 but it's a fromsoft game so it's alright i suppose
Fantastic game.
It's easily one of the greatest games I've ever played. Might even be the greatest game I've ever played. It's really hard to put into words how much I love this game. I originally bought this for PS4 with over 1000 hours played between all console characters, with Platinum achievement (all 41 trophy's), but had to buy it again on Steam for the PC experience (glad I did). I fully plan to compete every achievement again and 100% at least 2 playthrough's between NG and NG+ on steam. I truly and fanatically love this game more than words can really describe.

If you are looking for a totally new experience in the Souls series and never gave this game a chance yet; please drop every game you're currently playing and play this game. As a former Call of Duty and competitive shooter addict, this broke my addiction and gave me a pathway to try new games. If you are new to the Souls series of games, this game is an excellent place to start. In alot of ways its very beginner friendly, however, its very challenging as well. This game encourages exploration heavily which is great as well.

This game is one of the greatest games of all time, and anyone looking for a decent review will find nothing but praises about this game. Its worth every penny, and in my case, worth every penny twice over. Please play it if you haven't. Don't deny yourself this beautiful exquisite gem of a game. Again, very challenging at times, but every good game should be.
Pfft... look at my time spent, what do you think?
perfect game
Rats are harder than death birds
VERY GOOD
MASTERPIECE
bosses are easy af and the enemies are boring af
I definitely found something to keep me busy!
Game gud. Me like game. If you no like game you stink :D
.
9/10, imo best first playthrough out of the whole souls series, except bloodborne.
This review is maidenless
You don't have the right, Oh you don't have the right
The hype is real. Don't let the "it's a hard game" stop you. The visuals are amazing, the progression is sensible and not grindy. It's a lot of fun.

One of the greatest action rpgs out there
This will put hair on ur chest regardless of gender. THIS IS THE PINNACLE OF GAMING
this game is fantastic and every single boss fight *especially the big snake& us hysr so well designwed andf fantastic and i love that u cant see anytghing on ur screen for 50% of the fight and randomly get hit by fire that isnt there its actuall hjust an incredible game and i will conitinue to enjoy this game very much
One of the best game..story, graphics, mechanics, world, bosses....everything is just awesome, cant wait for the DLC. money spent well. Dont think twice before buying..
10/10 everything
good
Amazing
This game is unbelievably good. I only wish the story was more fleshed out, instead of being left vague like most other From Software games. Other than that, it's perfect for me.
i mogged mohg
Fun
Best game ever made.
GAS
Maidenless, Tarnished, Elden Lord. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.
Morre, briga, morre, cavalo, morre, jump attack, morre. Excelente. Me sinto realizado.

I would not recommend this to anybody who hasn't played fromsoftware for a good portion of their lives, watched hours of tutorials and this still doesn't make nearly any sense, "oh that's just a skill issue" Well gosh darn it, if you really wanna play this game, be my guest, but I was thinking this game was some masterpiece from everybody around me, I give it a solid 6/10
ulcerated tree spirit is BS
10/10 
Make sure you have spare controllers ready
very fun and makes me suicidal at the same time, strongly reccomend.

First time playing and haven't made it too far but after understanding the game and learning the mechanics its awesome i recommend.
i like everything about the game
If you're a casual player then get ready to be hated for enjoying the actual game and touching grass, instead of memorizing every enemy attacks and torture yourself
GOAT

I dont like Elden ring. so this Might seem biased at some points.

Elden Ring really resonated with me for about the first 50-80 hours (just a heads up I have north of 600 hours on ER on PS4) but then the game just eh'ed itself. the game is the most Middle grounds of the FS games. 

summing up Mediocre and frankly linear levels of DS3 in order to have a "Decent" line of progression. as for a newer player. they would literally quit the game after getting 2 sk by anything in Caelid. hence it is mainly used just for endgame purposes. and Yes. I know that Caelid is for more experienced players who want better things. I know. but the "Legacy dungeons" have little to no world building in them. very rarely any shortcuts. cause they just put a bonfire outside of the bosses doors now. which seems to me as an excuse to not design levels for interesting moments of "Holy shit Im back where I started."

it also perfectly sums up the "difficulty" of DS3's bossfights. but manages to tear apart the good parts. and add only bad parts. this one will be mostly a comparison to DS3 and ER, as both of them have a similar feeling in terms of combat. 

ER and DS3 have both the fastest (except BB) dodging gameplay for a FS game. both are quick and easy to move around. Cameras will sometimes go crazy but otherwise the dodging mechanics are basically Copy and pasted from DS3 (with the addition of an actual jump button!) anyways. onto the real point. Both ER and DS3 has similar types of Bossfights. Speedy. Hard hitting and decently portrayed. as said. I do not like ER's boss fights. DS3's bossfights never overstay their welcome. they only under-stay. a boss such as Gael and midir feel like you never want it to end. and the combos are just enough in order to stop anyone from trying to kill anyone, or throw a massive rant about how its "unbalanced"...

You see. this is where ER fucked up. ER copy and pasted the best parts about DS3's bossfights. e.g. the presentation, moves (honestly ER has some of my favourite moves in all of FS games) and well the design. but it lacks in 2 major points:

the Lore is just dogshit. Honestly I dont know who did it either George RR Martin or Mr Miyazaki. but the Lore in ER is by far the worst. there is literally nothing for a normal casual player to understand the lore. tbh on my first 2 playthroughs (both were blind) I had genuinely no idea wtf was happening and I just couldnt see myself understanding the lore and any given time. 

And secondly, it overstays its welcome. Most fights in DS3 can be similar, e.g. Crystal sage. but anyways. I have this huge problem with Radagon. I loved this bossfight to death when I first saw him. I even played through NG+ as him once. but my love for him has only faded. Radagon has 1 major problem. he doesnt change at all. his entire boss fight is literally just him repeating the exact same combo which never ends btw. with either a move that is fair to dodge or an absolutely unfair Poke. which deals stupidly high DMG btw. I know the entire community is probably gonna say "git gud" cause why not. but seriously I hate these 30 second long Combos. which only give you 1 or 2 hits at the end of it (I use UGS or GS's only, never dex weapons) 

anyways. i really dont recommend this game. i find it just boring and repetitive.
I hate this game so much, had a lot of rage inducing moments, mainly because I'm not that good at the game (git gud, so to speak). 

Nevertheless 10/10, loved it, would play again.

Great game
I hate it
Worst of the fromsoft series, maybe other than ds2. Insane input delay issues for the last 2 years, that still havent been fixed. Tried giving it another shot, but cba to use esp to telegraph mob's attacks because it takes 10 frames to dodge.
May Chaos Take The World
Extremely laggy mess, don't buy it.
great for single play
Elden Ring is the culmination of everything From Software ever tried in their previous games perfected and placed in a stunning open world. Game of the decade.
Once in a lifetime experience.
Meow
game is lit
the endgame was a bit easy, even on ng+3. godskin duo and fire giant suck, other than those two, very good game
CAELID SCARY
ranni mommy
its a great game, beautiful, lots of replayability, and especially time consuming but i have one problem and its kind of a big one. like all other fromsoft games, the pc optimization is absolute ass. I cannot hold over 50 frames on all low settings with a pretty decent computer. frame drops happen like crazy, and always at the worst times mid boss fights. i get used to it, but every time i return back to the game i get reminded of how much of a problem it is.

also lowkey very salty i purchased the deluxe edition during the pre-order phase and now i still have to pay an extra $40 for dlc. it feels like i was punished for buying/supporting the game early but theres nothing i can do
Yep, it's good.
this game made my pant white
Pure suffering, but addictive... like loving a woman

a
meh... its alright.
it would be nice if it had an easy mode and maybe a more notable cast like Dawayne the Cromck Johonsen or Bad Pit
cant wait for the netflix series tho. Zendaya would be amazing as Dung Eater

XYSMENO GAME
Need I say more? The culmination ov every other game FromSoftware has developed packed into oneaction-packed banger of a game. Absolute Recommendation!
Great game, simple as.
Fun gaem cant wait for DLC
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!
One of the best if not the best Game of all Time.
uwu
very nice
simply the best game ever made

very fun game. makes me blush

Dear FromSoftware i am Writing this message Because Ur game is too difficult please make your game easier so i dont jump into oncoming traffic preferabbly truck so i die instantly ps. Can you ban this steam id Permenantly from the game 76561199061433022
chaos
Its addicting. I dont want to work. I just want to play it.
It's a good game, if you want to start with the soulslike genre this might be the best starting point. It is very polished and the least unfair compared to DS1-3. Open World is sometimes a little empty, but in general there are a lot of sectrets to find and it rarely feels pointless exploring. Difficulty seems fine to me, there are some encounters that are really challenging but i never felt cheated. For fans of the Souls series or souls like games in general this game should be a no brainer. For everybody else it still is a very safe recommendation and worth its money.
This game is a masterpiece. 10/10
easy
game good
cool game tbh
I was wrong, this game deserved GOTY.
Elden Ring is simply a monumental achievement from From Software, a magnum opus from the great Miyasaki himself, its a fantastic RPG that is designed very meticulously and beautifully, the atmosphere of the Lands Between is on point and captures the "Dark Souls" feeling tremendously, the game play is at its peak, it stays true to the combat roots of souls games past and just feels ever so tighter, the addition of jumping in this game may feel strange at first but it adds a whole other level of combat, the lore of the game again is fantastic with the help of George R.R Martin even though you would have a better time watching lore videos on YouTube but that's just souls games. 

It is a masterpiece for what it is, is it Dark Souls 4? No, in my opinion some of the areas do feel to big with not to much going on, personally i prefer a more streamlined experience but for what its worth, i have enjoy pretty much every second of this game.

YES I GOT NO HOES STOP REMINDING ME
Initially very good game, however over time getting overly complicated very poorly balanced, not fun.  The creator should have better balanced size and abilities of the boss opponents. Requires hundreds of hours and hundreds of re attempts to pass certain bosses, what defies purpose of balanced fun. Finished the game, initially very good and getting boring towards the end.

Majestic game, best one to play if you want to check out the Souls series.

PERFECTO

Yes.
Yes
game good
I liked that the world is really an open world. Not like in other games where you open a map and have 15 locations to visit with pointers
beste spiel wo gibt
I really like demon souls. This game still good
-Start game
-Go to Leyndell
-Sacrifice Melina to burn Erdtree
-Do frenzied flame ending
One of the best games i've ever played in my life. Worth for it to be called GOTY. Spending hours learning patterns, builds, and strats best feeling i've known. Futhermore, the OST is sick as hell. Yuka Kitamura is really the work of art to these soulsborne games. Favorite boss of all time to Maliketh, The Black Blade truly a design.

Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki for changing my life to this game.
I'm late to this game.  It's definitely fun and beautiful, though I think it lacks the depth of BG3.
Why buy drugs when you can buy Elden Ring
best game ever created
:)
ranni' so good

Challenging, engaging, and extremely fulfilling.  I wish the story was a bit easier to understand but that‚Äôs what YouTube is for :)
Bloodstain? Therefore try skill.

Take the breaks. Don't break anything

Wtf are you looking at the reviews for this game for?

Are you stupid?
I will play this game for the next 10 years
A little bit of Marika in my life

A little bit of Ranni is all I need

11/10 i would do anything for this game.

perfect
One of the best games of recent years.
The difficulty is present but it is not unfair which makes it pleasant to play.
Ruins your life but good
Amazing combat and Very long story line
Why do you read Reviews? PLAY THE FUCKING GAME
i understand its the hardness and then the triumph that wins people over in this game, its menus are rage inducing on pc cuz you have to use the consoles main menu thing to leave every inventory

a year later and its still the same broken mess you guys are fing stoopid for giving this game of the year.
shit is good
AV 10/10
gore
yis
Try fingers
But hole
Pickle...

on a more serious note, this is genuinely one of the greatest games i've ever played and not putting it in my top 10 would be criminal after the hours of enjoyment i've had. the world is breathtaking, there isn't a single area of the game where if you stop and take a breather for a second or two, you'll be hitting F12 a couple of times. the variety of locations are insane. i won't say much to avoid spoilling, but i was often shocked at the amount of ideas they managed to cram into this world without it feeling unnatural. there are some traps in the game that teleport you to late game areas, and you'll be shocked at how big the map is, how cool the areas are and how the fucking common dog just one taps you. it makes it so when you actually reach these locations through progression, it feels really good to not get one shot or actually one shot the enemies that were giving you such a hard time. besides that, exploration is fun and feels actually really good. usually in your skyrims and copy pasted ubisoft open world titles, you just look at your compass at the top of your screen, and hold W in the direction that has the most appealing icon. sure you're "exploring", but you're not actually looking at the route you're taking. in elden ring, the compass only tells you the cardinal directions, so if you want to find anything, you either have to look at your map to see if there are any points of interest or actually look around using your eyes to spot interesting things. this gave me the same feeling i had with breath of the wild a few years ago where i'm supposed to do one thing, but i just see another cool thing after another i just get sidetracked for hours. the bosses are what you expect from a soulslike, tough, maybe rage inducing (if you suck) but fair. if you haven't played a soulsbourne game like i have before this one, this is easily the best intro you could have to them. all the bosses are great, the build variety you can have in this game is seemingly limitless + if you struggle too much on a boss, you can just go into the open world and come back when you're better. the only flaws i have with this game is that it's in a serious need of a questlog (it's not normal that i have to have the wiki open on my second monitor just to remember what a NPC said 60 hours of gameplay ago) and it could take the ULTRAKILL way of death. what i mean is that if you die, you click R, no loading screen, you spawn right back into the boss room. i fucking hated the commander niall runback
souls games will always be special to me, because of my favorite mechanic.
your character doesn't get better, you do.
Nice open world game

nice
never played souls games before , am glad i played this game
it good
Shits trash
nice, easy, fun to play. very recomended

The only souls game that is worth playing if you hate using a controller the kbm movement feels way better compared to all the other games. 

Also dont bother with the tree sentinel when you first enter the open world its the big golden dude on a horse the devs are trolling you hardest boss in the beginner area just dont even bother with this guy
LO
One of the great ones
I can't get enough of this game! Every time I play and then stop to watch Youtube  I go back and play it. Every time you play you just come across bundles of new and exciting things! It's unbelievable how much is in this game. 1000/10 tier game, never gets old.
op
beautiful
One of the best gaming experiences of this decade, if not the best.
fun
One of the best games I've ever played in my life
Edit: still true statement
    Elden Ring is the second worst entry in a terribly dull series of games, only behind Bloodborne. It keeps up the Souls tradition of keeping whatever "story" it has hidden behind item descriptions that people pretend to read, and if you bother to do so you'll only be met with abstract fantasy tropes that make the world feel more paper thin and pointless. Something worth noting due to the devoted fans often praising the story and George RR Martin's name being used in the game's marketing campaign.

    As for gameplay, if you have played a Fromsoft game before, you have played Elden Ring. The only real difference is they have added a horse. The core combat mechanics of Souls games are solid in terms of how the player controls, attacks have a great deal of weight given to them with fast kill times, cool status effects and a lot of stagger on heavier weapons. This is all wasted on the terrible enemies who are not fun to fight. The vast majority of enemies and even bosses have incredibly simple AI whose only directive seems to be lunging as fast as they can in a straight line towards the player, to a point where difficulty can frankly just be measured by how fast an enemy is. It's very lazy and the dumb AI is just begging to be cheesed and when you add in the fact that many of the later bosses are simply faster and have longer range than most weapons and fighting styles a player might find fun as well as having the ability to pivot the upper halves of their bodies like a robot on a dime to hit a player that just dodged their attack, the game starts downright demanding it. 

     Probably the game's greatest sin, however, is how lazy the world design was. One of Elden Ring's selling points was it's huge map and open world design. The game is indeed big, but much like Skyrim, in order to fulfill the promise of a large map they simply copy pasted enemies, dungeon designs and even bosses. Once you've reached a certain point in the game you get the feeling that you've already seen it all and you're just going through the motions doing the same things all over again, and that's because you have and you are.

    If you're looking to Elden Ring for a thrilling RPG? Look elsewhere. A mechanically dense fantasy action game? Look elsewhere. A large and detailed world with exciting and varied exploration? Look elsewhere. Elden Ring is best looked at as simply a minimalist generic dungeon crawler that *might* give you some challenge if you aren't skilled in the art of cheese and nothing more.
Goated
behold, dog! ahh, beautiful
try finger but hole
This game has something for everyone. If you like women there's Ranni,if you like men there's Alexander. If you're aromantic, there's arson.
I am mentally ill
I don't have word that can describe how much I hate the camera in this game, other than that 10/10
An open world souls game. Who could ask for more? This is an all-time great.
bonk
hard but fun
One of the greatest games ever made
Yeah so I've been playing this for a few hours now and... oh it's been 200 hours..?

Anyway, this game is amazing. I was skeptical that it could live up to the high standards set by the previous games, but it easily surpassed expectations. My only criticism is that there are some brutal difficulty spikes. For example, they keep telling me to get a girlfriend, which at this point is completely impossible.

Also, I wish there were more swamps. I only counted like 6 or 7.

Elden Ring is a fantastic sequel to Lord of the Rings, and has made an amazing addition to the trilogy. It was even better than Aragorn's Quest for the PS2. 10/10
Love this game
As essentially anybody who has put time into this game would attest, it's genuinely incredible. It takes bits of both the best and, yes, a little bit of the worst, of each of the previous Soulsbourne games and manages to negotiate an incredible experience. Absolutely one of the best games I have ever played, and feels like what Souls was always meant to be.
gud
is gud
Astel still sucks but now I never have to fight it again.
Big stick go boom
Greatest game ever bar none

What a wonderful game. Its my first one from the fromsoftware games and I need to say its such a wonderful journey, if you dont already have it please do! 
The dlc is going to be awesome!!!!

Malenia ez.
Good open world adaptation of Dark Souls Game play
yes
If you struggle with this game here's some advice from a Sekiro veteran. GIT GOOD
Taught me how to roll through oncoming traffic
melinas a baddy (Edit dont grab the frenzied flame)
George R.R. Martin's Old Circle: it's pretty good considering what most games offer today 9/10
Git gud. Stay Hard. Wanna die? Play this game
I spawned; died to malenia; spawned, died to malenia, spawned, died to malenia...

10/10 would get wrecked by sword mommy again.

Best game of the decade?
good
Just buy it
More addicting than heroin:

I had never played a souls like game before Elden Ring. Purchased it on release week on the Xbox and my mind was suddenly opened up to a whole different genre. I Spent a straight week and a half at my best buddies apartment just so we could play through at the same time. Learning everything together and summoning each other when we got tremendously down bad. Switched my build multiple times till I got a bleed build, which was broken when the game came out. Now I'm trying builds that I didn't even know existed. I remember beating the Elden Beast for the first time at 3 in the morning while screaming my lungs out and the feeling of accomplishment and reward from beating the main story was something I knew I'd never get back.

Then I got it on PC and I got that feeling over and over and over again. 

Most beautiful, rewarding, content rich game I've personally ever played. Metal as fuck.

Buy the game.
One of the greatest of all time

Period
just buy it dude
This is a masterpiece. A challenging and rewarding game with exquisite stories and fantastic bosses. The music is great, fights are great. You may be lost for a little, but some minor searching on the internet should allow you to figure everything out. If you have the money, get it. You won't regret it.
its goated

this is one of the games ever made
A game with some gumption, truly is the entrance into a golden age of video games. Now we just need the DLC to be good and for Bloodborne and Demon Souls to come to PC.
please help me
if you want a big challenge go ahead
great game
good game
Great game
so much to do and always finding something new, like bosses that one hit you. 
10/10 would reccomend
This game can be frustrating at times i'll be the first to say but when you overcome that frustration, it's some achievement. This is by far in my opinion one of the best games ever made. That's also coming from a non souls player, at least until i played elden ring that is. To put it in perspective i had played dark souls a few times when i was younger and not aside from that, and after playing elden ring i was drawn to the souls and soulslike games as a whole. That being said this game is a 10/10.
ekwmrfo efawfgargeargeragrg
.
great game!
play game be maidenless become a lord get maidens.
hell yeah get  it
@ 100 hours play time 
Score 3/10
Horrible combat, controls, keybindings, camera, boss fights and target lock-on.
Bosses have fluid move sets and great mobility that look cool this can't be said for your character. The player is stiff, limited, locked into slow clunky moves that can't be canceled.

Exploration was great for 20 - 30 hours but it got to the point where I don't care anymore due to the gameplay being so poor. Can't be bothered to finish the game.    


@ 7 - 8 hours play time 
Score 7.5/10
Pros
Great open world to explore.  If it was not for the open world I would not play this.
Lots of variety in enemy mobs.
Good loot.

Cons 
The usual bad combat (roll around) in all these types of games. It was bad 20 years ago, but at least back then you could blame the less powerful hardware.

PC port is terrible and it is to be expected from this company.
1) Keybindings and controls, most of the times I am fighting the controls and camera 
2) During boss fights, with Auto-lock on or off, camera will lock to other enemies that are far in the background. 
3) A lot of unexplained controls on PC like how to two had a weapon.
4) Example, no key bind for the mount they expect you to hold "E" then take your hand off your mouse and use the directional arrows to select it or other abilities. Really, can't just let us bind to some other key? 
5) No support for 3440x1440p
6) Very lazy PC port, at least the stuttering is gone that was there at launch.


Its alright I guess

elden rin
Game good, many choices from receiving hugs to sponsoring an aspiring academic's educational scholarship. 11/10 if you get stuck go find a cave and become god.
A masterpiece. Unperfect, like all of them, but a masterpiece nonetheless.
i fucking hate this game
Thank you Miyazaki.
Amazing game :)
The Brilliant Goldmask, man his questline is way too long but quite brilliant indeed!
If you want something Difficult and challenging i would recommend
I've been a fanboy of Hidetaka Miyazaki since the release of demon souls. I've played all the dark souls and I've loved it all. Elden ring is definitely a master class above all the others. Its lore and depth along with engaging battles have me putting at least 500 hours between PS5 and Steam. 10/10 Cant wait for the DLC this summer!

Just Buy It Tbh
this is one of the video games of all time
.
Visions of joy..
Rump required ahead
This game is worth every single penny, and even more. The amount of content it provides is astonishing. I still haven't finished it, although i am close to the end of my journey.
I'd buy this game second time without hesitation, even if i had to pay more. Thats how good it is.
Masterpiece!
W game
good
DLC soon
I think a dlc would make the game better!
nutted fr
[h1] Good game [/h1]
Fun game almost as good as Dark Souls 2
mama malenia on miequalla
I farted
Ye be bold tarnish, for I was the fool that beat this game and lost to madness, may any god you serve save your soul... (Cause they ain't gonna be with you)
this game is sooooooo goood i busted a fat load
This Game made me hard 10/10
good game is good
very sadly, yes. 11 out of 9
I can't get bored. Map is giga huge and beautiful. Best game so far 10/10.
I picked this up nearly when it came out. Jumped in without knowing what souls-like was. Went cool character creation, great graphics, the world looks cool no wonder people are raving about this game. Then got absolutely murdered, over and over again. Highly discouraged I've put the game away 3 times. About a month ago I decided to give it another go. I really took my time to really understand the tutorial and abilities. Finished the tutorial boss who had once absolutely stomped me. Used a few beginner guides on direction on where and what to do at lower levels. Also learned where to get your mount because I didn't know that was a thing and the game tells you nothing. A major thing I learned was not all enemies can be beaten early on for newer inexperienced players. I've been conditioned from other games, you take out who you see.  This is trial and error, if someone is too hard just simply come back later. Once I wrapped my head around that the game was way more enjoyable. Saying that, some bosses are extremely rage inducing and will take plenty of attempts to beat. However, I feel I'm a pretty average gamer and I completed it. I think if you are patient and hard headed enough to keep trying anyone can beat this game. So if you're interested about it or the upcoming DLC and worried about difficulty try it anyway. Its hard, yes..  but not impossible. Once you figure out most patterns you can destroy a lot of bosses... and dying 20+ times and finally kicking their ass does feel rewarding. Just keep in mind this game never lets you feel like a god so don't get a big head as you die because of a miscalculated dodge roll into your demise.
- Can't drag the map or use the mouse cursor on the map, just WASD and the "controller" cursor on the map. There is literally no purpose for the mouse cursor on the map. Why is it even there then? 
- Can't rebind button for map because it is for whatever reason hardcoded to G.
- Dodge and sprint are on the same button. Holding button for sprint and short press for dodge. This is beyond stupid because it automatically results in a delayed dodge because the dodge starts when you let go of the button instead the moment you press it. 
- Can't use quickslots / quickspells, not even with mouse and keyboard where are more than enough buttons.
- Incredible bad mouse and keyboard controls. Rather Fromsoftware has no idea how PC controls work or they simply don't care, both possibilities are equally stupid especially in 2022. But since they put dodge on a delay just to increase artificial difficulty I would guess they made mouse and keyboard controls on purpose so incredible bad. For example Lord of the Fallen, Lies of P, Surge 1+2, Star Wars Fallen Order or Hollow Knight, all of them are souls like and all of them have exquisite mouse and keyboard controls. 
- "JuSt pLaY iT wItH cOntRolLeR iT is beTtEr."
Of course that game is better with a controller because Fromsoftware put literally zero effort on making a good mouse and keyboard support. That don't make it right. I know there's a contingent of Fromsoftware fans who insist that the only way to play is naked, in a blizzard, being harried by hungry wolves but there's no logical reason for a third person action game to be better with controller, or with mouse and keyboard - you don't much benefit from the greater aiming precision of a mouse, or the analogue movement of a controller (and analogue keyboards are a thing too)... Just imagine there comes a game to console were the main input device is controller and the game is not really playable with that. There would be a terrible outcry. But even for games that are designed around mouse and keyboard in mind get a proper controller support such as Anno 1800. Must be some kind of magic... 

Fromsoftware's games are designed around controllers. They've essentially been using the same layout since Demon's Souls in 2009. If Fromsoftware hadn't also made Sekiro, a fast-paced combat game, I doubt Elden Ring would even have a jump button today, it's the single biggest change in years. Otherwise you still use the D-pad to swap between weapons and items, still use the shoulder buttons to attack with whatever is in your left or right hand, still use the same face buttons to drink a potion and two-hand a weapon.

Those controls must have carved permanent neural pathways into the brains of every Fromsoftware designer at this point, which would explain why the PC layout seems to be trying to replicate the controller experience, rather than adapting it to the mouse and keyboard's strengths.

Therefore Turn Back

Incredibly approachable for players new to souls games. Looks gorgeous, gives you so much to do while not influencing you one way or another, so fun to simply explore. I'm absolutely awful at it but it's still fun as hell.

It doesn't support 21:9 aspect ratio unless you download a 3rd party program and play offline which is stupid since I own games from before 2010 that have no issue with 21:9
This game goes hard but im harder
10/10 phenomenal game
Never got past Solider of Godrick
more than my balls but lowerthan my tits
I've played DS2 and DS3 but Elden Ring is probably my favorite 10/10.

Noice!
World of adventure

Malenia is definitely the Blade of Miquella
fun
This is the culmination of the Souls series. If you like Souls games, then you have to play this game.
I don't have enough patience to play this game and why am I already at 120h?

sucks bananas


I Love ELDEN RING
Spent 15 Hours (Currently), Died More than 200 or maybe 300-ish.

Another Fromsoft banger. The exploration is unmatched in this game.

good game
I guess it could be fun if you like staring at "you died" screens
amazing game
Iss aigh
hard
Probably the best game I've ever played. From the moment I first opened Elden Ring, I have been hooked. This game is so polished, other triple A games don't even come close. Additionally, Elden Ring has SO much content it could easily be split into two full games. Phenomenal job by FromSoftware! <3
Goated
This game will make you fall in love with it and despair
literally beat it 17 times and still finding new things to do
is good
This game redefined my love for videogames, storytelling, and lore in general. I can't recommend it enough.
Picking up items sim.
one of the games to ever game

This game is so delicious. I can ride a horse and let him take all the damage until i get knocked off. Chasing the elden beast is the only bad part but Ranni makes up for it.
try finger, but hole
Chad game
If you don't give up, you'll find yourself in a fantasy world you couldn't have imagined yourself. Something that you never knew you needed. The only match making difference i would make is allowing larger ranges. like summon in limgrave and being able to go anywhere in limgrave together. (portals out disabled.)
Kirby 2
very fun
fingers and maidenless
Delayed attacks simulator
Great game, but the invasions are still awful and annoying as always. No one wants or likes forced PvP, and didn't ask for it. Especially when hackers invade you. At least the playerbase came up with a good PvP spot when you actually want to fight other players and not have them interrupt your progress. Just be careful of picking up items other players drop, since they can drop hacked items to get you banned.

best game ever
Very nice game

Great game. I have been a souls fan since demon souls, and the dev team just keeps stepping up their game
The joy I find in destroying every single furniture that comes upon my path is unimaginable
Fort night
game fun
This game plays better on my xbox series s, Ally Rog z1 extreme and my ps5 than it does on my 13600k rtx4080 or my 9900k 3080, This game is the best tho, shame it freezes on me,
Hallo?
Greatest game I have ever played. Will go down in history as one of if not the greatest game of all time. FromSoft don't miss
yes
its a from soft game obviously its great

Almost 200 hours on my first playthrough. WTF is this game? Also, best game ever. 10/10 would play again!
gacor wak
My wife divorced me because i spent to much time with Malenia. 10/10 game.
I try my best
10/10
The best.
I'm immensely love elden ring , the exploration and its boss design and the loving lore.
but i can't recommend whoever that seek the fair challenge like fromsoft previous game, why?

because of elden ring absurd dodge lag which never seen in previous fromsoft game, never. 
i don't know why this technical issue is introduced in elden ring and never even get fix after so many years of release. in a game that relies to be dodging almost frame perfect in SO MANY occasions. this is game breaking. and the mouse lock on system were also inferior and infuriating. like i rely the directional axis to change lock on target??? so i pan the camera when fighting boss and the same time change the lock on target? and then lock on jump to another target from miles away and i died in middle of the heat lmao. the most absurd control i've encountered in my life. these technical issue is too much to bear and making the experience suck. despite they're absolutely fixable but they're not for unknown reason. 

just to be clear, i did not find the game too hard as i can beat tree sentinel by level 1 and no hit. but the entire experience is suffered from these cheap technical issue. if it's their design in the first place then they losing my absolute respect for them, because this is not how challenge work.

so no, i'm not gonna recommend this game from a lazy dev to anyone. those are the most basic technical issue but still present in the game.

edit: i'll absolutely change my review to positive if they're at least fix this two problem.

Wonderful
Buckle up, boys. This will be a long one.

I'm writing this as a reminder to how I'm currently feeling so that future me can look back and appreciate how much this experience meant for us.

My journey to the Elden Ring started with the very first trailer at E3. As a big Fromsoftware fan, I was thrilled as was countless people. During the silence between trailers and info, memes and culture around the game grew and expanded, "Oh, the Elden Ring". Being in those communities who were waiting in anticipation was amazing, and something I consider to be part of the overall experience of this phenomenal game.

I couldn't play it when it first came out. I didn't have a pc powerful enough and I didn't want to play it on my PS4. In my mind, I wanted to experience it at its best. And that I did, 2 years later. Avoiding spoilers, which I really care about, was difficult. Every time I would go on social media, there's always the "possibility of getting spoiled" always sprung up. Needless to say, when I got to play the game, I hadn't spoiled myself at all, successfully avoiding it all.

As I launched the game for the first time, I remembered the unbelievable hype right before the game came out. I thought to myself, 'Could it meet those high expectations?' And it sure did, exceeding those expectations by a long margin. This sentiment is shared among the players and critiques alike. Elden Ring and Fromsoftware really did come out on top.

What is there to say about Elden Ring? The world they crafted is dense and beautiful. After the endgame, I would find myself looking beyond into the scenery and simply gasp in awe. The detail they put into crafting the world of the Lands Between is exemplar. The combat fluid just the way Fromsoftware perfected it. The variety of weapons always gives you endless options of trial and error which went along with the freedom of changing your stats to attempt different strategies.

The lore, ah, the lore... truly outdid themselves again. I have never been invested in the lore of a game before, not as much as now. Even though it is vague and leave a lot to interpretation, I still adore this fragmented world. And those stories went alongside the characters and many bosses in Elden Ring. Never did I fight so many bosses and consider how 'cool' or 'amazing' they are because of the lore. There's so much to be said in this department and I could go on hours discussing the detail and care the devs poured into maintaining. Seriously, amazing.

With the dlc coming, my journey within the Lands Between isn't over yet. I will be back riding my trusty steed in no time. Until then, I bid this world farewell.

10/10
best game ever.

I did myself a disservice by deciding to play through Dark Souls 1 before picking up Elden Ring. I still think it's a good game but it decisively failed to replicate the transcendental experience that was Dark Souls.
Why are you looking at my review? It was game of the year buy it, play it, love it.

i do not recommend this game for casual gamers. As much as I loved it, it is extremely difficult. ~for example~
I've played this game for 218 hours, and I still have not beaten it. However, if i look past that, it isa avery good game. Insane views, inticate story, interesting characters. Its just a shame how everything is locked behind an impossible bossfight, just for there to be another impossible bossfight. HOWEVER, bossfights are actually very fun, once you get the hang of it, weave in their, dodge that attack, now strike! You probably get the idea.

Even if personally i still like Bloodborne a bit more Elden Ring is by far one of the best video games of all time
its not very common a game with such huge variety of enemies can feel fair 90% of the times (those 10% that feels Bs does really really suck, Melania im looking at you)
If u are struggling with the game just go watch some newbie guides and keep playing trust me, if i finished everybody can finish the game
it's ok
God-like
No longer Maidenless and driving off in my Accord.
best souls game i have played , kinda beginer friendly , i bought it on pc and ps5 beacase you can play for hours and still find something new to do , highly recomend
Bilgus My Beloved.
Good game

This game is a complete masterpiece, utter insanity as to how this game doesnt have more people playing it right now. My love for Dark Souls games came to a sudden rise with the release of Elden ring. Its great fighting mechanics, balancing, and enemies, make this game one of my top tier games to play for anyone looking for a satisfying time

HOLY SHIT THIS GAME IS ADDICTING!!!!!!!!!!
my flask mixed pysick was laced with fent
This game holds up to game standers even tho its 2 years old as of now right before the DLC has come out but I absolutely love this game I mean this is my second time buying this game once on PS5 and now on PC.
The good? Basically everything.
The bad? It's hard to think of anything. I would say the only thing that got annoying was overleveling due to properly exploring the whole map. Besides this one small thing, this game is the definition of perfection to me.
old circle
game good
Fun
Masterpiece.
open world copy paste slop - miyazaki has dropped off
Good
This game is so pretty and awesome but like can we kill those 2 gargoyle guys like they can go to hell. 9.9/10 game please play it
VIDEO GAME.
Who is malenia again?
this piece of work is wonderfoul, i mean: it's dark souls with jumping and open world, best combination ever. there is no way back
Is good.
Perfect game
too hard
So no head?
Currently my favorite game and I cannot wait to play the other FromSoft games. (ALSO DLC COMING SOON!!!!!)
Came back to play it with the release of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and achieved the 100%.
Still as amazing and infuriating as the first time I played it two years ago.

THE greatest video game of all time.
gret game :thumbup:
I am Unga, therefore I Bunga
Dark Souls II is better
still no maiden :(
have always been hesitant to try any fromsoft or soulslike games but this has definitely got me into the genre, if youre afraid to jump into these types of games like I was, try this game it really is not that hard especially if you just explore and get overleveled by the end like I did

which brings me to my next point, exploration in this game is AMAZING. i was shredding bosses at the end just because exploring in this game is so damn fun, I really dont think any other game nails exploration like this one, its just so satisfying to look at your map and find landmarks and stumble across various dungeons and caves and quests

this game is truly goty material
yes
If you enjoy a challenge, this is your game. 
- Multiplayer is shit. you have to manually re spawn your teammate after death. if either people die, both get sent to there home worlds. I cant even finish off a boss when my teammate dies.
GOAT
I mean, it is elden ring, man.
hard
Cool
Amazing Game! I made a bunch of characters and have New Game Plus'd more than a few times. This has excellent replay-ability and so many areas to explore for endless hours of enjoyment.
club go funny bonk
death stick go silly

the world goes round
may chaos take the world
RPG MY ASS WHAT ROLE AM I PLAYING THE VICTIM
killed malenia before I killed myself. Deserved GOTY and im waiting for more depression DLC.

best game ever
better than minecraft eldin ring
challenging and rewarding
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

super choppy for no reason
Gud game
yes

Easily one of the best games ever made. There is a constant positive feedback loop of exploration where you are both discovering interesting content and getting frequent new items (weapons, armors, spells, crafting recipes, etc) that can significantly alter the way you choose to play the game. There is a huge build variety and it is fairly easy to respec or just readjust into different builds to try out different playstyles.

This game is huge, almost too huge, but I think it remains insanely compelling throughout, but I love every fromsoft souls game so YMMV but I think it has something for everyone and a lot of ways to mitigate difficulty
Fromsoft just doesn't miss
.

everything
It's a good game. You have my review now.
#1 Souls-Like Game out there!
very cool
hard but fun
Great Game!!

10/10 game
gud
 good game
Its good fun !
Best game ever. Cant wait for DLC
mid
Damn near perfect. My only complaint is I wish filling in the map would have been as you go and explore any ground you cover fills in the map rather than the little towers thing they did. It just felt out of place.
n
Seamless coop makes it playable for pleebs like me. Very pretty game.
makes me wanna kms but brilliant
Unintuitive.
I know this is a great game based on other reviews but I'm just not finding the fun. It's hard and unforgiving, and does everything it can to want you to quit right from the beginning. I'm guessing there is a story and adventure in there somewhere but it doesn't appear I'll ever see it.
walked out a door got called a maidenless runt then was slaughtered after
getting called a "foul tarnished" brought something in me.
Ohhh my gahd make me wanna scream without the S.
why be depressed when you can go be a little guy in a from soft game
Death.
good game
Of all the games you can play, this is certainly one of them.
What else is there to say but Trial By Fire...
It will punish you constantly but as someone who has never played a Fromsoftware game prior to this or any Souls type game, I can easily say that I loved this game more than I ever thought I would.
11/10
The narrator moans in your ear in the opening cutscene.
BGE
A never ending game!
DS1>Elden Ring>DS3>DS2 (Haven't played the others). Really good game but the open world (legacy dungeons are the best part of the game) and late game (bad enemy scaling and repeat use of enemies and bosses) holds the game back. Still very much worth playing. Very accessible to newcomers for souls-like games (learning curve but summons and ashes of war are broken).
This game had me going through 5 stages of grief and I absolutely loved it üòé
yes
i liked everything
get good
As long as you don't choose bandit at the start, you can have fun :)
as a pro masochist, i love this game
yes
thrust but whole
top tier game
git gud
good game
i like style of fight and charicter
awsm
Open world Dark Souls. Download, rage, maybe cry, play NG+. This is the way
Great game. Combat is amazing and so is the lore. I can not understate how fun the combat is once you learn it. The sheer amount of viable builds is astounding and makes you want to keep playing to try more. First souls game Ive actually gone to NG+ because I wanted to fight a specific boss again (Malenia)
10/10
You can get a hug from a woman.
Best souls game 10/10.
gives me anxiety
yes
First FromSoft game I've played, and quickly an all-time favorite. Beautiful, challenging, satisfying - and your horse can double jump :)
I don't know what can be said that others haven't. It's just an amazing game! Rightfully deserved GOTY 2022, and it's easily the most fun I've ever had with a Soulsborne!

but I really liked the combat system it's variable rich and the same goes for incantations it's the coolest thing ever , I like playing against something and say I want his weapon or his incantation it's cool using his moves after killing him ,good reward system 
I like weapons scaling ,talismans ,dragons , art üëçüåπ
 This is not just game of the year, it is the game of the decade.  Difficult? Yes. Repetitive at time, for sure, but nothing is as satisfying as the perfect character build that allows you to kill the boss that has been destroying you for the past 30 attempts. "Get gud" never applied more than to this game and that is why it is the best in the series of soulsbourns. Cannot wait for DLC when it drops
This game will put you in your place. 10/10
i put those foolish ambitions to rest
Amazing
Worse than Dark Souls 2

oggg game
W ouchies=fun
Alas, I am a foul tarnished ....
I started this game thinking how fun then I soon began to eat those words and began to run.
I ran from a normal giant when I was level 10 and once I reached Radahn I believed it was the end.
However I stood my ground and was victorious but that feat left me curious.
Curious to learn more about the game.. who are you to blame.
Watching hours of videos on end in a never ending descend.
Apparently you have runes in your inventory, thank you game and your glory.
I used my runes got up to 500k and felt like a true lord, however fate had something else in store.
I tp'd to the round house and left to get a drink but to my surprise I heard a clink.
I turn around as I die to Ensha leaving me in despair however I was now aware.
I shall claim back my runes easy as pie .......................................................................................
Alas I die....
How will I recover, I wondered, and alas I started to grieve.
"O you do not have the right" the message I see every time the door is fake, leaves me with a headache.
So I put the controller down and take a break after all it was getting late.
I get on Youtube ready for bed, but that's when beauty struck me across the head.
A beauty witch by the name of Ranni appeared on my screen OHHH what a Heavenly scene.
I can marry this beauty!! I said aloud as my mother told me to shut up I was being to loud.
I get back on in the morning to meet the witch, my soon to be lover. That's when my heart was switched.
Melina couldn't compare the difference between them was oh to unfair.
I got down on my knee and OOOHHHH I swear I could foresee.
Foresee our future together hand in hand, I had our future all planned.
I get off to rest while feeling blessed.
I get on in the morning... I start mourning.
She has other servants, all male too which left me in disturbance.
OH WHAT SHOULD I DO
OH WHAT SHOULD I DO
OH WHAT SHOULD I DO
OH WHAT SHOULD I DO
OH WHAT SHOULD I DO
Alas I am the ELDEN LORD as its blaidd I'm walking toward.
I slay him in cold blood, surely looking like a stud.
Iji Is next, a weak fellow as I turn him to jello.
Finally was Selvius, quite a mouth on him, after killing him the situation became grim.
MY QUEEN WAS GONE
SHE'S GONE
SHE'S GONE
SHE'S GONE
SHE'S GONE
I wonder around aimlessly in misery. It then hits me.
I look on every platform for a fix, surely someone has a trick.
ALAS, THE CHURCH OF VOWS
It was my cure. A chance to wash off all that's impure.
However the clock was past midnight and I had school at first light
So alas I head to rest before my next journey as I leave y'all with this

Update: We're Married >:)
Still no maiden...
With the Shadow of the Erdtree coming out I want to express my love for the original Elden Ring experience. To the great warrior Alexander, to the lake of rot. Elden ring was my first experience with the souls-borne franchise. Like most people I want to be in a world where I can leave my chair and imagine my self slaying dragons or picking flowers. Elden ring drops you off in this world with rich story telling, cool bosses, and beautiful landscapes which was made possible by FromSoftware team. If you have free time on your hands Give Elden ring a chance, you wont regret it, best game I have ever played.
(P.S Miyazaki please add A death blight swamp for the DLC)
Its ok didnt really like it

maidenless
elden ting
I died again. Fuck yeah.
:3
cant sex the maiden
Ooooooh EldenRing
I lost my sanity

O' you don't have the right, O' you don't have the right
its a masterpiece  game. can you make a demon souls boss in the  shadow of the Erdtree and Deluxe Edition ple :] .
:)
maliketh's a bitch
Best game of all time
i love and hate it but worth rotting away for a hundred odd hours looking at fightin cowboys vids while i sit there in my chair thinking what has happened to me and the world but cold game
Ranni made me her consort.
From Software has created an open-world masterpiece with a lot of content and places to explore. Open world is well above average compared to other games. In many ways, the game feels like a combination of all FromSoftware's Souls titles. It was a great decision to select the best aspects of the Souls games and consolidate them into one. If you enjoy boss fights, you'll be kept busy as there are over 100 bosses in the game. A lot of options to make your builds, with various weapons, armor, sorceries and more.
Best game ever
gud game
Best Rpg whatever ever made, I have played this on every console and have to say its amazing.
I speedran NG+7, got four hours and 50 minutes on it. Just wanted to get that out of the way.
This game is peak and I love gathering smithing stones and gathering new spells and skills and weapons to test out a fun build I found online.
One of the best open world RPG games ever.
game good
behold dog
kill god and hug a baddie, what's not to like
If you love action RPGs please try Elden Ring out. Best game Ive ever played and would highly reccomend to anyone

beautiful overworld with lots of variety in levels, bosses, enemies

lots of builds to try

great replayability
fun game big sword
10/10
no explanation needed
its dandy
SLAYA
one of the hardest soul game you'll play,enjoy xD
I have played before on ps5 and switched to pc thats why I dont have many hours on steam but holy shit this game is fucking amazing and I cant wait for shadow of the erdtree. Elden ring might be my favorite game of all time and imo it is a masterpiece. Pc performance has been good for me and it seems like fromsoft has fixed pc issues at least for the most part. This game is huge and is full of places to explore. This game is so good that the few problems that it has are easily overshadowed by all the things it does right. If you are new to this game one piece of advice do not try to kill the tree sentinel at the beginning of the game.
this game is so beautiful sometimes i spend hours ingame just staring at ranni's toes i cant get enough of it
probably my favorite from software game besides bloodborne, still waiting for that on pc. Very excited for the DLC
s tier

amazing

I love this game. 50 hours in and I am not even close to finishing it.
What can I say that hasn't already been said?
Top-tier world and level design, challenging but fair combat, gorgeous and terrifying artwork.
A spectacular game worthy of all the praise it has received.
It's cool
Played Elden Ring on PS5 when it was released and got the Platinum trophy.
Bought it now on PC incl. the DLC and will 100% it again.

It's definitely one of the best games ever made.
shits 10/10 but horribly over rated
IT'S THE GOAT!!!!11
The best of all time
Not even lying, the greatest single player game you will ever experience in your life.
hard game
Good
Praise for secret passage
for every likes this review gets I will do 1 Push-up.
Very good, no microtransactions. Amazing open world that is very detailed and beatiful, One of the best oat
It's like skill issue, but also not
Best game in years

Elden Ring brings a fresh take on the action RPG genre, blending the signature challenging gameplay of FromSoftware titles with an expansive open-world setting created in collaboration with George R.R. Martin. Players can expect a deeply immersive experience filled with rich lore, intense combat, and breathtaking environments. "cant wait for shadow of erdtree"

great
Most fun I've had in a while. Tons of content. Highly recommend.

This is a very mixed review reflecting the conflicted feelings I have about this game.
On the one hand there are a lot of aspects of the game that I enjoyed:
The graphical beauty of it, the variety of combat styles. etc.
But the one overarching deficiency that troubled me throughout
my time spent with the game is the extremely limited cohesive story
that is being told in the game.

I feel most engaged by games that are providing an immersive
experience to the player by virtue of their narrative but Elden RIng,
while visually beautiful and compelling, did only provide me
with the barest scraps of story telling. What the game does do
is world-building which could have been used as a foundation
for good stories but was unfortunately not used much in that way.

In the end the game kept me somewhat interested by keeping
me busy with its mechanics but at the same time the progress
through the game felt mostly meaningless rather than important.
The fallen leaves unfortunately do not tell a story.
It would have been great if they did.

In summary if you are a player with a strong interest in well told stories
then you should probably avoid this game since you won't get much
of that. If your focus is a lot more on combat mechanics and the visuals
then maybe this game is a fit for you.
Best game I've ever played. Do yourself a favor and buy it.

Do I have more than a day of playtime on this? yes. Do I still struggle and yearn for competency? absoulutely.
good shit
One of the best games i've ever played.
Elden Ring came out and told the ubisoft-open worlds to sit tf down and see how it's done, and it slaps the shit out of those kinds of open worlds because it literally just says "here's your goal, good luck" instead of filling your entire map in question marks, lvl ranges, points of interest, and whatever else to jangle keys in front of your eyes, which is refreshing, because everyone enjoys the sense of discovery.

My main gripes with the game stem from how the game tackles questlines, and it's a gripe I also have with DS3, in that how to progress certain quests, or even start some, feels like you need some walkthrough open (because why would I go back to this one merchant who sold nothing of perceived value because I heard some howling in the wild, or investigate this one well that's out of the way?). Small things like that adding up and culminating in "they told me something incredibly vague or just said goodbye, how was I supposed to know I'd encounter them on this tiny path, off to the side, in the dark?" happening numerous times.

That and if you don't like enlarged insects there's plenty of areas in the game where your stomach will churn and your mind will immediately tell you to get the fuck out of whatever god forsaken shithole you just wandered into, so if you have some kind of entomophobia... I wouldn't venture into the place with giant ants.
Absolutely amazing, an actually difficult game.
THE BEST GAM EVER WOOOOOOOOHO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mind Blowing
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD
Armor and shields actually do stuff in some boss fights, vs the tried and true go-naked-and-roll-around-stabbing-the-butt-for-30-minutes tactic.  As in, wearing armor and blocking with a shield doesn't break poise immediately like every other Souls game.  My big complaints are horsey combat is pretty derpy and you never know when to heal your horsey until you feed your horsey, sometimes it's super difficult to know where to go next so explore everywhere and talk to every NPC you can, and the biggest complaint:

9/10 enemies and bosses jump around like FleaMen in Castlevania on pogosticks, spinning, slashing, jumping around some more, getting 27 attacks in a row off just hammering you until you do run out of poise and get staggered.  Like imagine they have a Dex bar and it's 12 times longer than yours will ever be. It's super annoying.  You can't roll away because they keep coming, and you can't attack because you were rolling and ran out of Dex, and you can't drink because they keep attacking.  The combat is really different from any other Souls game, and then add mounted combat fights on top of it.  You'll still die a lot, just in ways you aren't used to.
Legendary game, BUT it does have some bad elements compared to other souls games. 
Here are the few of them:
1. Reuse of bosses as a mid level mobs. 
2. Copy and paste tombs. 
3. Zones that are balanced based on the level of your character but you wont have a idea besides the difficulty. So you play the game, discover new zone and now you are 50 lvls ahead and one shot everything even zones bosses... The basic auto-scaling of HP and damage of enemies would fix this. To play this game to its full potential i recommend googling "RECOMMENDED LEVEL BY LOCATION | ELDEN RING WIKI". And tackle the zones on its level.

Rare game that I've decided to 100%. One of the best of all time.
Easily one of the best games i have played in my entire life 100/10. Miyazaki always cooks
I think it is one of the best games ever made. And everybody should give this ART a chance.
The best gaming experience you could ever have
this time i won't rage quit

ez pz lemon squeezy
This is THE game of all time. Beautiful graphics, amazing bosses, and great music, but at the cost of what? sanity? time? these things are meaningless in the age of order, and after all the the pain and suffering, you are left with victory, the sense of power, and the message of pickle. 10/10 game
just Amazing Game . its a very hard game but massive . a must for a owner of a good pc that can play this game in all its glory at max settings. just runs and looks outstanding . so looking fwd to the DLC in june . Elden ring is one of the best games out there today 10/10 .
Mige
first souls game more like first dulls game, i simply outplayed every boss there was just by being over leveled.

good
What a game! I've been a gamer for almost 30 years now and I can't recall a gaming experience with so much depth as Elden Ring. This was my first time on the souls-like genre so there were many new things to learn but the journey was worth it. 
To me Elden Ring is a masterpiece and a work of art in so many levels, from the lore, level design, the combat system. The transitions from area to area and the degradation of the world as you progress offer unique feelings and truly captivate one's soul. 

Becoming an Elden Lord is an experience unlike any other and I strongly believe that it's a must for all gamers out there.
 
Thank you FromSoftware!
I love this game it makes me cum so hard. It's so good I want to fuck up jars for no reaSON
cant have sex with malenia 0/10
I knew the game is hard so I set a simple rule, if I can't defeat a first enemy I see in 2 hours I refund. 

The first thing I saw in the game was a guy on the horse, not sure how hard is it supposed to be but yeah. I did maybe 20-30 attempts. But at this point it becomes boring.

I know u can roll around like a turtle and stuff but I wanted to do it myself without guides or whatever .

No hard feelings, I highly recommend to experience this abomination first hand.

What I didn't expect though is that given quite outdated by modern standards graphics it runs quite poorly on steam deck.
Just epic!
good game

Art
Just finished Elden Ring not too long ago with all achievements collected and all bosses defeated. It was my introduction to the souls games and I got my ass kicked, especially by bosses, but those losses made the eventual victory so much more rewarding. While very enjoyable, expect a challenge when you buy it. Anyway 10/10 from me.
 could this be a something incredible
Great game. What open worlds were meant to be.
oh aahhh yes so good

I love Rings of El Den. Very cool. makes my sad bad go away. Specially when Ranni talk to me. Waa Waa Wee Waa.

Great game, even for people new to FromSoft titles (like me) if you're willing to put in some time and work. Exploring the vast, great looking world is rewarding as you find dungeons, loot and optional bosses (most are). The enemies, especially the bosses though, are also really well designed.

However, some small criticism: While the enemy variety is ok, there are a bit too many copy-pasted ones for my taste, especially with some of the bosses (looking at you, Commander Niall, copy of Commander O'Neil but with bs summons) and mini-bosses/bigger enemies (why do we need so many dragons?).

That said, buy it and if it's too hard, there's always an overabundance of guides for builds, bosses etc. so even Soulsborne newcomers can beat it.

I'm not gonna sugarcoat it
its pretty good i guess

The freedom to challenge a boss later till you get stronger is really nice. def can't wait to see what happens in the dlc and what bosses/weapons are there
Elden Ring is a glorious adventure in which one embarks on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord and, perhaps, rule the Lands Between.  The Lands Between display a wide range of fantastical scenery which inspires awe in the beholder; one may explore the ruins of ancient civilizations, castles, caves and more. 

 Numerous items can be found which tell the reader of the lore of the game; the closer you pay attention to NPC dialogue and item descriptions, the more you will learn about the Lands Between and the role the major characters play in its history.

Some people complain that graphical assets, locations, and enemies are simply "cloned" as needed, but frankly there is enough variation in enemy types and justification for their presence if you pay close attention.  Furthermore, if you didn't encounter various enemies multiple times, it would be more difficult to take advantage of learning their move-sets, so I don't really think this is something to complain about.

On that note, in this game is a more streamlined variant of the play-style typically found in the Dark Souls series which boasts an array of different gimmicks which can help the player in creating "almost" whatever build they want in order to complete the game.  I say almost because it is both possible and even likely that a player will screw up their first character if they don't bother to look up a guide for it first, but this is alright in my opinion; this is the sort of game where you have to be wiling to learn from your mistakes and adapt to changing circumstances if you wish to overcome the challenges the game presents you with.  Even in the face of the Waterfowl Dance, there is a way to prevail.

This game can be difficult, especially if you aren't used to games like this.  However, beating it is that much more meaningful as a result.  Be prepared to feel anger, frustration, and watch as your character dies  over and over again, but always remember that your eventual victory will be that much sweeter.  Buy the game and have fun.
Oh the game is fine, I just have ADHD
ive 100% completed the game once on playstation now on PC

Best cock and ball torture I've ever played so far!
if bad. try getting gud
It's another one fo those "award winning" games. Super hyped ultra letdown. IGN rates it a 10/10. That means it is really 2/10. I rate IGN as 0/10. I played this for 5 hours and hated it. Uninstalled it forever. It is a master class in the real world skill of marketing. In contrast, IGN gave Days Gone a bad rating and I can't wait to play it even after completing it. They are wrong on both these games.

"Elden Ring offers a vast world of excitement!" I was never excited. Only irritated in record time.

Elden Ring is really a condition that forces older people to wear diapers. "Hey bro! You got Elden Ring? Please don't sit on my new couch!"
Amazing, obviously.
Greatest game of a all time
FFFF
eh its alright
Played for like 300+ hours on console and ive played for almost 75 hours on here and the mods are worth the price alone
Hated at first, but soon became addicted...
Very good game if you want to loose every social skills for the next months
Absolutely no direction in this game. You'll spend most of your time lost. Beautiful game though
good game skysouls
Good
A wise man once told me to "Block, parry, dodge" I was able to beat Margit without leveling up or getting any special equipment with this mentality (Played thief class)
This game is hard
Overall a good game, but the delayed attacks sometimes get annoying. Also fuck fire giant, elden beast is a coward rat.. why are you running?, 9/10 would play again, (-1 point for the tons of reused bosses, it gets really repetative)
i dont know how to parry
Fantastic game, If you like Hard difficulty games, this is for you.
Absolute masterpiece, even though the open world has some flaws, and dont get me started on godskin duo.

But that aside it amazing and you should absolutely play it!
This game is really really fun 10/10

The Dark Souls games are some of the best I've ever played, and yet Elden Ring surpasses them in every aspect. This is a must play game, and relatively accessible compared to it spiritual predecessors.
fun and cool
Great Game

I've been playing the souls series for a long time. I was one of the few peeps playing pvp in 4:1 on Demons Souls on the old ps3 before Dark Souls was even announced. Elden Ring is a great game, truly beautiful, and I highly recommend it. But there are ways it needs to improve and with the dlc coming soon I hope they can address some of these issues.

Here are some of the main things bothering me when coming back to it;

Movement controls- I'm glad the devs realised that jump needs to be assigned to a separate input to roll/backstep/sprint, and that console controllers have limited amount of buttons, but on PC we should be able to assign different keys for all. A separate bindable input for roll, backstep and sprint, not just have them all lumped together on the same input.

Menus/spells/items- This game uses the very same menu system and item/spell selection system as the first game from back in 2009. Back then it wasn't even good. I understand that this can't get fixed for the dlc but on PC we could easily have a hotkey system whereby we can assign say 1 to 9 for whatever spells/items we want to use, rather than scrolling through a list in one direction with one key. Honestly this system is clunky and annoying. Since they fixed the spellswitch glitch waaaay back at the start of Dark Souls the menus have seemed laggy and cumbersome too.

Open world- The open world is okay but I think I prefer the interlinked dungeon feel of traditional souls games, particularly Dark Souls 1. I tried to explore every nook and cranny and kill everything in my first playthrough and it took nearly 250 hours. Still missed a few things. By the time I got to the end game I was completely sick of wandering around exploring vast spaces and things felt very barren with nowhere near enough good loot. Also, do we have to keep having to explore these white snow areas looking for items that only show up as white blobs on the ground? 

I don't want to get into pvp because there is just so much wrong. I haven't seen souls games as decent pvp games since the dawn of DS2 tbh, but the pve and coop is great.

Apart from that game 2EZ need hard mode.
all i know is death and bonk and im all out of death
Best game I've ever played, never felt disappointed, unrivalled masterpiece! ‚ù§Ô∏è

funny game go brrr
I played Elden Ring for the first time and ended up spending 8 hours straight in just one day without even realizing it. This game is incredibly addictive; I could play it all day long. I highly recommend it.
I can't wait for the DLC ! 
It's elden ring and I enjoy the souls combat. Approachable for players new to darksouls/fromsoft, but still has the souls combat and difficulty depth for returning players. If you were on the fence about buying a souls-like game, I'd give it a chance, just be sure to pace yourself and familiarize to the way combat works in the game. Also bring a notepad for sidequests

Okay first of all...
I can't describe how much fun (and pain) i had playing this game as a newbie in the souls-like industry. I had everything i wanted, to exploration, very tough combat, discovering dungeons, going straight down in each dungeons, even the lore got me hyped (can't wait for the DLC btw).
I can definetly say i'm happy about playing Elden Ring even though quite late, but better than neve right ?
I'm looking forward to play the Dark Souls and the other games of the same genre, the challenge was there and i'm up for more ! 

Worth your time and money 10/10.
This game is one of the best games that I have ever played and this is my first time playing a souls game. Even though it was hard at first, once you understand the mechanics and build that you want to make, the game is very rewarding when you beat the big bosses.
A gift from god
Amazing game. First game in a long time that is an actual challenge.
Probably one of the top 3 best games ive ever played.
Solid Fromsoftware soulslike game. Definitely worth playing and finishing. Quality of the game dips a bit towards the end. If you like this game go play Darksouls 3. Same devs, similar gameplay, but better.
blue wifu
fum gayme
Story is good, but gameplay mechanics are horrendous.
Best Game
best game of the decade, i just love it.
good
Ughhhh can we stop with the "I'll leave this cat here to pet..." its not cute, leave a review or dont..Do your part, dont encourage these wankers, ignore them!!

Also, Elden Ring is gorge
ous, looks great on steam deck, and its hard...trying to play on SD before DLC drops
good game
The best Triple A game I have ever played in my life
This is the kind of game that defines a generation of them.
theres nothing bad i can say about this game (except the chariot dungeons), i love almost everything about it (most certainly not the chariot dungeons) and will be looking forward to the dlc (in hopes it wont include more chariot dungeons)!

boc the seamster is the best of boys (but i would trade him for no more chariot dungeons in a heartbeat :D)!

dying to malenias waterfowl dance almost two hundred times wasnt nearly as frustrating as dying to the chariots like five times (i wont be setting a foot into one of these hero graves ever again).

love the game, i recommend!
yes
Greatest game of all time
tl;dr - very good game, terrible anti-cheat implementation

------------------------------

my main issue is with the games performance, and its because of easy anti-cheat. don't get me wrong, its better than nothing and in a souls like game on pc cheaters are abundant, but there is such a significant drop in my fps from 90 -> 40 with easy anti cheat. for a game developed by a company that seems to have enough resources i expected a better optimized solution that wouldnt impact the performance so negatively.

im not really sure why easy anticheat kills my frames, but it does operate on the kernel level which is kinda intrusive, and the fact that it doesn't even reliably catch cheaters is just laughable. why is this thing even here? 

i ended up just disabling it and enjoying the game at a respectable frame rate, playing online isn't even worth it when it drops my frames by half. 

aside from the anti-cheat the game is massive and absolutely fun to play. if you want to sink a good amount of hours into something this game can do it.
It truly lives up to all the hype.
YES
If you are like me and like souls games you have probably already played this by now, it's like Dark Souls III but you have a horse.
Even if you don't like souls games you'll probably still like this one. The more of the world you explore, the more stuff you find to mitigate the difficulty curve if you'd rather just play for the story. 
Something here for everyone, great stuff all around.
greatness
One of the greatest From Software games out there!
Best game in my gaming collection.
nice
chef kiss
Game good


good game
Fun but can be a little overwhelming, especially if it is your first souls game
BEST SOULS GAME EVER
straight bussin
good
Schmelden Ring is the current champion of Souls-Like games.
As long as forced pvp is a thing for co-op I will never give them a positive review. Great game otherwise.
No doubt this is a great game, fully deserves GOTY and I see the appeal... ...BUT... 
From a casual-gamers perspective : Is it fun to die 90x in the first part of the game with no progression in 8h ? 
No. 
I don't have the time or patience to "Git-gud"
VERY AWESOME GAME EASY TO 100% REMOVE FIRE GIANT THANK YOU FROMSOFTWARE, TIME FOR DARK SOULS 3 OHHHHYEAAAAAAAAAH
yes
if you didn't start, for your own good don't. RUN.
been playing since release and still haven't finished it, great game but wish it had more large dungeons like Dark Souls
epic
good
the best game i had
BEST GAME OAT
top 3 games ever, 4 different playthroughs and im still finding new stuff
nice game but wtf losing the runes to lvl when dying is just stupidest thing ever 

Goat

Mid game. Final boss fight is a major let down.
Wow. Just wow. 
Finally completed a Fromsoft game, and this was probably the best RPG I've ever played.
TOGETHAAAA, WE CAAAN DEVOWAAA THE VERY GAWDS
Despite having 84 keys on my keyboard and only being allowed to use 10 of them, it was worth it. Combat is clunky on MnK but after a few hours(days) you do get used to it. Story is cool but you will have to look online how to do it because there is no quest journal, even though it is an open world game.

It is a beautiful and immersive game, though, since it does have an official PC release the FPS should not be locked to 60 and it would've been nice if FromSoftware had allowed us to completely customise keybindings by now, 2 years later. The ray tracing is still as pointless as it was on release, there's no noticeable difference between having it on off other than the -15 frames per second. I don't even think reflections are ray traced.

Multiplayer is available at the cost of PvP being enabled, meaning, if you want to play along with your children or partner, expect to be ganked every 5 minutes. It's just tedious and annoying so I'd advise just playing alone in offline mode if that doesn't sound appealing.

DLC is on it's way, I'm looking forward to an extension of the main story and harder bosses (like Malenia), I'm also interested to find out who this new antagonist is, I've found some scraps of his existence in the standard game but only in really secret locations so hope to find out why he's been erased from history. Was it him who first burned the Erdtree? Hopefully along with the DLC we may have some standard game improvements, 2 fingers crossed.
Less abusive than my relationship i give 11/10
its one of the best dlc games i've ever played

Godskin Apostles theme is the best thing about the whole game and I will die on that hill.
Deus vult
Dont die. Get Gud.
Theres more
Obviously the best game ever made.
great game

99 hours and boredom ain't in one! It's Elden Ring, not much more to say I guess. It keeps your ego in check but oh boy, do you feel so accomplished when you finally beat that boss! FromSoftware rock at all things they do! Can't wait for the DLC and anything else they work on. #markedsafefrompatchessofar
A Souls of superlatives.  Compared to any other Souls, it has the biggest world and the most number of bosses. It's also the easiest, even if the infamous Malenia is nothing to sneeze at. As far as eye-candy goes it's the prettiest too.
The musics are simply epic : I've got Godskin Apostle and many other boss musics in my play list.

This is my second run, two years after my PS5 one so I'm going way faster. My first run lasted 180 hours as the game was largely unknown and unexplored at the time. If you want to make it last, don't read too much about it online.

It's a Souls. It's from FromSoftware. It's obviously recommended.

Now I fight as Hoarah Loux, WWE Superstar Deluxe Warrior!
It's pretty good
Scarlet Rot is the worst status to ever exist. Good game.
if you play this game. you should go touch some grass
yes
Good
played a lot its good game :)
excellent
Probably top 3 best games of all time. Everyone should Play
got gud
is game
Favorite part is being able to help friends and others pass bosses and level them up.

The sweaty pvp can be avoided if you're just trying to enjoy yourself.
Playing solo and using summons, is one way to go about this. Other times you just make a meet up spot with your buddies and enter passwords to make sure you can see each other. Enter the fog walls asap so noone can invade and if they do invade they go away instantly, cya fun sucker. Sometimes we will just off them together real quick but, when you start a new character or helping a new player it can be a bit stupid. 

It would be awesome to have a full pve mode where you and your friends can do whatever you like without pvp. As some of my friends that aren't usually into this style of game can still have fun. I can't ask most of them to play anymore which is pretty lame. 

There are still cool things to experience besides pvp. You have story, lore, builds, different weapons attack styles, spells, ect. It's all fun to mess with.
I put another 100~200 hours on ps5 and plat it on there as well. Love this game, and other souls like. I just think it would be awesome to have an pve only mode on each of them so I can not only help my friends but also my wife without a random being toxic. 

It is amazing that it doesn't matter what our level is or New Game+ progress, we can still be summoned using passwords. Love it. Thank you for this feature.

Pvp is fun sometimes, but it should be opt in. You can get your butt kicked when I feel like kicking it.
i have 100 percented this game and played through it three times so i can safely say, this game is shit
game
if you dont have this game, do you even call yourself a gamer
Big note saying  "chest ahead" at the edge of a cliff with nothing in sight... there were bloodstains everywhere but surely they just missed the jump.... i just had to be sure
very good
+ Fantastic environments
+ Interesting combat
+ Impressive game mechanics and design

- The UI is an absolute disaster, it's almost unreal how they can fail so hard. For example, you can't compare the stats between the shop's gear and your equipped gear, and finding out what abilities or bonuses an item has can be a challenge.
Best game ever made

Good Game!
I am literally the Elden Ring

buy this game
I don't know what you will have to do to get the money to buy this game. Just get those money in any way possible, buy it, and make sure you spend all the time needed going through each inch and pixel of your screen to explore one of the best games ever. Make sure you play this before you die. You could die tomorrow at a car crash, so you have to buy it yesterday!!
Zesty
Best game
Try finger but hole

Just have to try this masterpiece
Best Open RPG game
Its fun but challenging which is good, and this is my second souls/borne game first was Dark Souls Remastered on switch
This game hates melee builds.

EDIT: I got gud so I like this game again, but strength builds are still discouraged
.
This game made me rage but you know what my dad beats me its kinda hard boss to be honest cant defeat him :(
just dont get mad block parry dodge nerd
played 250 hrs on ps5 and 117 on pc still trying to get gud
Hell yes
What a world to get lost in and ultimate flexibility in customizing your character to suit your favored play style. I've put over 240 hours and that's just in single player. On a break now but coming back as soon as the DLC drops.
GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fun

Well, it's an EMPTY BARREN Dark Souls game that spits on Dark Souls honor 

To be honest, you must look on youtube where to go in the game, it's counter intuitive. Buy on sale, not for full price. 

The best part about Dark Souls - immersion and world, the best part about Elden Ring - character builds, these are soooo fun
good game
makes me sad!

It's beautiful game but is also ridiculously hard. I'd rather just walk around and soak in the scenery than actually play it.

This game is very good! :3
This game is just downright unfair. Theres a lot of copy and paste boss moves that are slightly different from eachother, I would be okay with that, but those moves are the ones that I always die by. This game is good if your good; If your okay at this game this game is not fun.

"Elden Ring: A Triumph of Gaming Excellence"

Elden Ring, the collaborative masterpiece by game director Hidetaka Miyazaki and renowned author George R. R. Martin, has emerged as a paragon of gaming excellence, captivating both veterans and newcomers alike. Released amid high expectations, the game not only met but surpassed them, delivering an unparalleled experience that has redefined the action RPG genre.

One of Elden Ring's standout features is its expansive open-world design, seamlessly blending Miyazaki's signature intricate level design with Martin's rich lore. The vast and interconnected landscapes of the Lands Between invite exploration, offering a sense of awe and discovery reminiscent of classic adventure tales. Each region is meticulously crafted, adorned with breathtaking visuals and atmospheric storytelling that immerse players in a world teeming with secrets and mysteries.

The game's combat system is a symphony of precision and challenge, demanding mastery from players while rewarding strategic thinking. From the diverse array of weapons and magic to the colossal and awe-inspiring boss battles, Elden Ring creates an adrenaline-pumping experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats. The freedom to approach encounters in various ways adds depth and replayability, ensuring that each playthrough feels unique and personalized.

Elden Ring's narrative, co-authored by Martin, unfolds with a captivating blend of dark fantasy and intricate storytelling. The lore is woven into the fabric of the world, encouraging players to piece together the history and unravel the enigmatic tales of the characters they encounter. The result is a narrative tapestry that engages players intellectually, adding layers of depth to an already compelling gaming experience.

The game's success is not only attributed to its gameplay mechanics and storytelling but also to its atmospheric soundtrack, which complements the visuals and enhances the emotional resonance of the journey. From haunting melodies to adrenaline-pumping battle themes, the music elevates Elden Ring to a cinematic level, making it a truly immersive and unforgettable experience.

In conclusion, Elden Ring stands as a testament to the potential of collaborative creativity in the gaming industry. Its open-world design, challenging combat, rich narrative, and captivating soundtrack converge to create a gaming masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the finest examples of the medium. Elden Ring not only meets the expectations of fans but also sets a new standard for excellence in the world of video games.

One of the Best
10/10
Tis nice
Elden Ring descends upon the gaming landscape as an opus of epic proportions, reaffirming that gaming greatness knows no bounds. FromSoftware's collaboration with Bandi Namco has birthed a magnum opus, a captivating journey that surpasses expectations, weaving a narrative tapestry as intricate as the Souls series and as expansive as the Lands Between itself. At the core of Elden Ring's brilliance lies its boss encounters‚Äîa symphony of challenge, strategy, and visual spectacle that elevates the game to an unparalleled zenith. Among these titans, Godrick the Grafted stands out as a macabre masterpiece. His lore, intricately connected to the lineage of the First Elden Lord, paints a picture of a fearsome warrior who revels in the grotesque act of grafting fallen adversaries onto his formidable frame. The visceral horror of facing Godrick is matched only by the visual splendor of his battle, where the player must navigate a nightmarish ballet of limbs and blades. This fight as one of the first in the game was extremely exciting to me, and although death was a common encounter, learning his attacks, and how to dodge them was one of the best experiences I have had to the souls-like introduction for new Genres for me in general. Similarly, the tragic tale of Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, unfolds amidst a mesmerizing encounter. Her connection to mystical forces and the celestial bodies adds layers to her character, while her battles are a dance with the ethereal, as illusions and magical prowess create an enchanting yet formidable adversary, the background especially of the serene moonlight ankle-deep lagoon in her second phase is splendiferous to say the least. Morgot, the Omen King, looms as a figure of abandoment, yet faith, his twisted lore intertwined with forbidden sins, and being born as an ogre, a species dishonoured and disregarded by the Royal family. The encounter with Morgot is a battle against unseen omens, an explination as to his sturdy faith in the erdtree, not phased by the rebellion amongst him. Starcscourge Radahn, with his ominous ties to the Gravatational Magic, he has mastered to ride his horse that is far too small for his towering body now, and eventually to the point of keeping the stars at a standstill, hence his name, his body embodies a relentless force of destruction. His lore and battle intertwine seamlessly, the player thrust into a cataclysmic clash with a figure whose wrath reverberates through the very foundations of Elden Ring's universe, a ferocious warrior, rotted away from the inside out, awaiting a warriors death. Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy, another one of the optional, yet beauteous bosses, delves into the dangers of forbidden knowledge and unchecked ambition. His twisted agreements, of being fed to a serpent in order to become more powerful than any demigod could have dreamed off, planning to rebel against the Golden Order, and his descent into madness are unveiled in a nightmarish encounter, challenging players to confront the consequences of meddling with the unknown, in front of the lord of blasphemy. The encounters with the Fire Giant, Malekith the Black Blade, Godfrey, Dragonlord Placidusax, and Radagon of the Golden Order are equally enthralling, each contributing to the grand narrative tapestry of Elden Ring. In the grand tradition of FromSoftware's design philosophy, each boss battle is a meticulously crafted challenge, a dance of death that demands players not only to master the intricacies of combat but also to uncover the lore that shapes these formidable adversaries. Visually and aurally, Elden Ring is a sensory masterpiece. The boss battles against colossal foes such as the Fire Giant and Dragonlord Placidusax are visually stunning, their towering forms and devastating attacks immersing players in a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming, along with the beautifully crafted cutscenes that make the game that much more enthralling. As for sidequests, and main quests for that matter, even though they dont tell you specifically are amazing, and Millicents questline, a young girl who writhes with scarlet rot, and is in desperate need of help, takes you deeper into an emotional level and understanding of the lore in the game in ways you could never imagine. Truly this is a masterpiece, and for new time souls players like me, I went in expecting to be met with rage and annoyance, similar to that of cuphead and others in the past, which had this difficulty, but surprisingly it was so fun, i'd find myself spending hours upon hours on end exploring the lands between without even realising how much fun I've had! Whether its strolling through the beauteous airy green lands, tainted with golden light that is Limgrave, or the abstract, subzero, and graceful silence in the mountaintops of the giants, each environment has its own story to tell, and I pray that you too will experience such fun in Elden Ring as I did, and am still doing so to this very day! In conclusion, Elden Ring is a triumph‚Äîa testament to storytelling, character design, and gameplay innovation. Each boss encounter is a chapter in a saga that captivates and challenges, setting new standards for the Souls-Like genre. Elden Ring is more than a game; it's an odyssey, an immersive experience that cements its place as a monumental achievement in interactive entertainment. A must-play for veterans of the Souls series and newcomers alike, Elden Ring stands as a beacon of excellence, etching its mark in the annals of gaming history, and after 100%ing the game, I can agree with absolute certianty why it won game of the year for 2022, astounding artwork, profound lore, incredible game!
Sometimes when I feel sad, I play this game for 2 hours to realize whatever it was, wasn't that bad. 10/10
game good
pretty tight, still havent beat mohg, dude has destroyed my cheeks countless times, will update once i have. thanks
Imagine trying to play a game with friends, where you have to youtube videos to figure out how to play it, then someone can just enter your world kill your friend and you have to waste time doing it all over again to get them back in your world. So much for progressing with friends.
I've been stuck on a final boss for weeks now. :(
I wish I could play this game, Im too slow

ITS HIM! ITS THE ELDEN RING!
one of the best games I have played in a long time. 10/10 

Badder than hell, man

dam good game, mildly infuriating sometimes, but the satisfaction always comes through
good game ! add to cart!

Masterpiece

w game
idk what took me so long to buy it but damn, what a good game this is, also, its my first souls-like (ig it counts as a souls-like since "Souls" isn't on its name) and if its also yours and you want to get into this world, definitely give a try. 10/10
Good game and you get a maidern after getting ABSOLUTELY ROASTED TOASTED BURNT TO A CRISP by some random homie who go "You got no maidens dawg ejejuejejejej" and can kull thjis homie so iss good
If you want Dark Souls 3 with more bosses, less creepy aesthetic and over all a bit worse (Peak Souls is just better accept it), then Elden Ring is for you
When it's on sale, don't buy it and wait for full price
This game is fantastic.  This open world feels completely open while guiding you in the right direction without you even knowing.  The combat is challenging, but also satisfying.  If you don‚Äôt own this game buy it now.  If you want a challenge and don‚Äôt want to quit this game then it‚Äôs worth 60$.
l
Is hard like rock but soft like boulder. Would recommend.
sadasd
can i trade this in for ghost of tsushima i dont like this game that much
There is nothing i can say about this game that can give it justice, i would do anything to experience it for the first time again, it's been years since the last game that gave me that excitement and itch to play it and progress in the story i feel like i am 12 again, i remember when i first played it and got my ass handed to me for HOURS against Margit, "put these foolish ambitions to rest" is forever imprinted in my brain, i don't think i ever got that frustrated playing a game before, after beating the hardest boss of my life i thought there is no way i am gonna finish this game if this is the first and easiest boss it's gonna take forever until i figured out you don't just run head first straight into bosses like you are running into a brick wall and you should level up a little bit, now after dying to Malenia for like 136 times i can beat her first try consistently haha
10/10 can't wait for the DLC
good game ahead
gud gam. wood play
i see the tree sentinel in my dreams

fun
I just 100% it.
It has its moments, but overall, Elden Ring is the soulsbourne genre perfected.

They have taken Dark Souls 1's ingenious level design idea and implemented it; 
Dark Souls 2's glorious mechanic ideas and fleshed them out;
Dark Souls 3's MP and side quest system and have made both enjoyable;
Bloodborne's enemy design and movesets;
and Sekiro's inspiring environmental setting design.

On top of it all, they have even managed to create it in such away that it is not only distinguishable from all of the above, but it has also become a wake-up call to other AAA studios to step up their game and has become a standard of open-world RPG games.

It is a game with a high learning curve, but it is much more user-friendly than any of its predecessor, so even if you feel like you're doing something wrong, the punishment for it isn't that big (ex, you don't need to start a new character if you wanna respec)

On top of it all, the community is very talented and has created multiple high-quality mods which can enable you to expand your fun - the best one yet is the co-op mod where you can finish the game together with your friends in one session (no summons other than in the beginning necessary)

I love this game. Wish I could forget I played it so I could replay it again fresh.
Goated game tbh
its swag
hehe funni gaem
elden ring had the potential to be great and build off the souls born games, and even the mods that have came forth to make those games waaaayyyy better,  but nope....they gonna feed you the same $!√∑# at marked up prices and then drop development to move onto another turd when elden ring no longer looks profitable, hurrah for corporate gains

I normally avoid these games as I'm pretty crap at them but it's long lasting popularity finally had me bite the bullet. 
I didn't hate it. Nor did I die as much as I expected. Mages ftw.

All that said I was far more into the Lore than  playing around with tons of builds, or pvp, or running countless ng+ runs. Not my jam.

It was a very enjoyable experience!
simply one of the games of all time
i ccant take. it anymore!!
Im 42 been gaming since i was 6 just after Nintendo came out. i beat Zelda before I COULD WALK. I gave up on gaming a couple of years ago, due to the fact that most all games suck, Especially new ones. Elden Ring brought back that feeling as a kid where the whole world opens up and is exciting. This game will make you mad and that's okay. It will make sense later on. The game is hard at first, but you will find a way to advance and be able to beat the big bosses later on. You will learn to enjoy losing. Keep leveling up. its like Zelda mixed with Assassins Creed and The Witcher, but better than all three of those games put together. Also there is little talking in the game which i think a lot of people would prefer. Its all action, you will not get bored and fall asleep. i hate those fantasy games my wife plays where you are falling asleep from the story telling. I only play this game and i will keep playing it till i die a thousand times, just like in the game. No better game. I give it a 100/10.  I would pay a 1,000 dollars monthly fee for this game, that's how good it is.
Best game of all time. Don't @ me!
great
One of the best games ever made, the visual style is beautiful and the game-play is incredibly well designed to be fluent and easy to use.

didnt get past soldier of godrick tho :(
The best souls game ever .
It's Elden Ring, a game by FromSoftware. If you haven't played it you should.
Dont make the dlc harder
Truly one of the games of all time!
no other game does open world souls like elden ring, its a beauty to look at and there are HOURS opon HOURS of content. dont even question yourself, if you found yourself on this page, you were MEANT to become elden lord....
Best game to ever be made
best souls game ive ever played. but kindda hard for starters and u surley need to watch videos and walkthrous. i love it 100000%
Maidenless?
ah yes, roleplay guts and bonk the living hell of every boss. Very gud game 10/10

Great Game LOVE IT!!!
thank you Miyazaki
Cool

Like wiping your ass with silk.
The godskin duo makes me wanna rip off my testicles
Play game lose to boss lvl up win in first try next boss repeat
At first, I wasn't really sure if I should get this game or not. I had no prior experience with any souls game, and hadn't even played any of the other From Software's titles. Buying this game was the best decision I could make. Although the difficulty was a little hard at first, killing the tree sentinel for the first time had me hooked. I had absolutely no idea where to go from there, and was let off into a grand open world. From there I knew I had to become the Elden Lord. As I am writing this, I have beaten the game 3 times, and plan on getting the other 3 endings as well. The more and more I keep playing, the more and more I discover. It's going to take me a while to actually complete this game 100%. I haven't been this excited about an upcoming DLC content pack, in forever.
Awesome game
I don't regret any of my almost 400 hours of playing.
The worst fromsoft game by a mile
best game i ever playd
I have an extremely healthy and wholesome marriage that i ignore because sword go "booonk", and lightning go "skss skss".... The game is so good i bought it on 3 consoles and forced my wife to play it. She beat it 7 times now, i'm actually having a existential crisis because my wife got the platinum trophy before i did. I gtg get these trophies now. My manhood is on the line.... if youre reading this, dont make the same mistakes I made. I just wanted her to play the game. I never thought she would end up being BETTER THAN ME. What have i created.....
really great game
(M&K review)

If you're on the fence about this game and you're expecting a well-balanced, well-designed combat system that feels intuitive and responsive, don't buy it. This isn't a finely-tuned, extremely well tested, and flawlessly crafted action RPG; it's intentionally made to feel sluggish, clunky, and tedious. This game suffers from many poor design aspects, some of them seemingly intentional decisions and others just a product of bad programming, which is pretty much par for a fromsoft game. 

Expect many deaths due to intentionally badly designed mechanics that are made purely to result in a player death, as they have no logical reason for being that way otherwise, E.G.: the mount handling and mounted combat, various inconsistencies in combat, re-queueing interrupted actions without additional player input or very delayed responsiveness of actions that then causes multiple queued actions to occur successively.

The good parts of the game are the visuals, the exploration, voice acting, and overall feel of the world. Fromsoft usually does get the survival/survival-horror aspects of the game right. I do generally really enjoy the exploring and the aspect of returning to a lower-level area after increasing your levels/gear and feeling how much stronger your character is compared to when you first went to the area. The good pretty much ends there though as the majority of the game is based around the dynamic and fairly robust combat system that was just poorly implemented in some aspects, and hindered greatly in other aspects by bad design choices.

The most glaring issues are the camera and lock-on system. You fight a lot of VERY large enemies, as well as have many areas of small corridors, often filled with ambushes and many multi-target encounters. The game's combat tends to feel the best fighting mid-size enemies one-on-one, when the camera is not busy being occluded or otherwise veering off in directions that don't allow the player to properly see mechanics and dangers. The targeting system has issues with multi-target encounters, as it will often switch targets mid-swing and has no way to turn off the auto-switching (even turning off all the "auto" options does not stop this behavior or even prevent what it seems to imply), and on top of that some enemies have their target cursors placed somewhere higher up on the body and your character will swing their weapons upwards towards the location of the target reticle, which will frequently cause attacks to miss (at least with smaller weapons, like most dex-based weapons). Unfortunately, because of the large, erratic movements of some enemies it's almost a necessity to use lock-on, especially with how particular the game can be about the enemy hitboxes, and this compounds the issue with the camera field-of-view problems. Sometimes you will have to turn off targeting and manually adjust the camera to actually see certain attacks or move out of certain mechanics, which feels particularly clunky with all the animation locking and sluggish movements of your character.

Some inconsistencies between what the enemies and player can do are also very aggravating at times, such as enemies being able to swing their weapons unhindered through most objects. Typically projectiles, unless the enemies arms are clipping through the wall, will actually be stopped by said objects, but melee weapons can go through objects, walls, and even through boss barriers (which, if you're unlucky, you can be hit through after the entry animation finishes). This wouldn't be as annoying if your character's weapons didn't bounce off most non-breakable objects and cause you to become animation locked by the reeling, while enemies can swing their entire arm through the wall unhindered, especially in the MANY small/tight corridors and catwalks with walls throughout the game. This really just feels like bad/lazy design, especially when enemies can corner the player this way but the player attempting to use the geography strategically will be punished for it. The body blocking by most enemies feels janky in many situations as well, as most enemies that attack you in groups  can attack through each other without hurting each other, can't be rolled through, often can't be rolled around if they are close to a wall (even if your character would fit through the space), and could only be pushed away with certain special skills. 

Point blank, mount handling and mounted combat both feel awful in this game. The mount handling is nearly as bad as Black Desert's, with a ridiculously bad turning radius, excessive inertia, and extremely limited capability to maneuver smaller areas. Turning in the opposite direction will literally cause the horse to run multiple steps in the direction it is facing, so if you are close to a cliff it can cause you to fall off of it, and handling anything besides straight forward movement is basically akin to F1 racing. (But don't worry, enemy mounts can do 0-point turns at any angle, even without the horse moving its feet!) The horse has EXTREMELY limited things it can do: double jump, sprint, and allows the player to attack with a very limited, slow moveset with very small range (at least with most smaller dex weapons). If enemies surround you on your horse near a wall (usually because they beam in from the enterprise) you typically cannot jump over them, cannot knock them away (because horses definitely aren't known to be able to do tha- oh wait, the enemy horses do all the time), and often won't even be able to turn around, so your only option is to try and dismount which is a long animation you can be attacked during. It really feels like they made this big world, then at the last minute thought "hey, maybe we should add something to let the player move faster" so they hastily added a mount then tried to implement the bare minimum of mounted combat because of all the mounted enemies.

The auto-facing towards the player some enemies do during certain mechanics can be pretty awful also, but that seems to have been an intentional design choice. I don't really agree with it, as most enemies already do a 180+ degree swing, and making the auto-facing cause it to be an even larger arc as a result is not particularly fluid or "realistic" feeling. Instead of designing mechanics that intentionally try to counter players attempting to flank the enemy, they went with this to force more direct dodging, and it just feels cheap and lazy honestly, especially when the quick-step skill is solely designed around flanking the enemy. I'd rather the enemy alter the move to be a 270-360 degree swing without changing the direction they're facing, or a backswing instead if the player is flanking them, so there's still risk but it wouldn't feel so janky. 

This game heavily favors specific playstyles (just like DS1 did), and some of them trivialize things, while others make the game exponentially harder. There are a lot of options for combat, but you can't easily switch between them because of the game's RPG nature and scarcity of upgrade materials. You may end up feeling pigeonholed in certain sections of the game where your build is less effective or a boss specifically counters it. 

Finally, the animation locking I'm indifferent on in and of itself, but certain long animations being uncancellable and even the fastest weapons in the game being slower than some enemy attacks that can start and end before your swing completes really make the combat feel awful sometimes, especially when it's a VERY fast move they can chain to the end of other animations that can usually can 1-shot from full hp. RNG seems to decide a lot of which mechanics are used too, so you can't always expect consistency from bosses.

tl;dr - a good basic system and fun exploration/survival feel, but combat is plagued by bad/lazy design choices and shoddy coding.
A game that is so infuriating that you can't stop playing. The beauty of the game also helps. You can truly have any play style and enjoy this game.
I like having sword
Best game ever made
Free my bro Blaidd
Great Game!!
I wish church was as interesting as this game, feel like if Jesus had a great rune, I‚Äôd be inclined to claim it for myself and become the next messiah

11/10

video game
played over 200 hours and still going
Don't have a ton of time for gaming so its good to know i can always rely on fromsoft to deliver.
One of my favorite game from Formsoft... it is good
Burn the world to save her (talking about your magical pew pew sword not Melina)
Why does it hurt so good!!?!?!?
cool :)
Excelente jogo, eu me atrevo at√© mesmo a colocar ele no n√≠vel de Bloodborne, o melhor jogo da s√©rie. Trilha sonora √©pica. Gr√°ficos incr√≠veis. O sistema de mundo aberto e de crafting com certeza foi uma mudan√ßa inesperada mas muito bem vinda na s√©rie souls. Embora algumas lutas de boss sejam absolutamente est√∫pidas (maldita elden beast, eu te odeio), a maior parte √© extremamente coerente e satisfat√≥ria, especialmente na primeira metade do jogo. No mais, caso vc esteja em um pa√≠s como o Brasil onde o jogo √© 250 reais, espera uma promo√ß√£o e pode jogar sem d√≥, caso vc seja f√£ da s√©rie.
its hard and when i saw melina i was too
it was fun

i like it
Good luck ... well, it's not that hard once you get used to the game, it's really fun and with the "new game plus" option. You can restart the game over and over again to keep levelling up and collect new gear.
i love how all the bosses give you hug after their introductions
ITS HELL
Gives AIDS if you play too much !
game of the year
OOOOOOOHHHH ELDEN RING
this is good very good open world explore
Elden Goat
It has so much to explore, and so much to do. You can spend dozens of hours playing without getting bored!

Its obviously a good game, but not better than the originals.
very good game
slow at the start but when you get into it, worth it.
Another one of FromSoftware's great pain souls-like but this time in an open world
best game ever
after 100% this game is a masterpiece. The bosses never gets too boring and still has the tension in the fights, the places look so beautiful and the underground areas are really colourful and vibrant. the weapons were great and had lot of variety of them so i can't wait  for the dlc to come out.
hell yeah
cool game
yup
Master piece

pretty good game
VEry NICE
10/10
Just beat it. Fantastic game. Can't wait for Shadow of the Erdtree.
I haven‚Äôt beaten the game, but this game is awful! I am 50 hours into the game, and everything keeps on killing me! I don‚Äôt even know how to upgrade my weapon! What do these stones even do?! Someone always tells me to level up vigour! But I don‚Äôt even know how to do that! I can‚Äôt even get my flasks back! The only way to do that is to die! Anyway 10/10 game would recommend
needs sex update
only a gamer david goggins can finish this
h8uhj9j
Makes me feel like shit
337 hours in and still want more, this game is amazing !
bring bloodborne to pc
Elder shit, best entry into ds but despise no life pvpers
The game is great just sucks that my tarnished is maidenless I was really hoping to start my own souls like harem but besides that i think the game is pretty good
what are u waiting for ? 
10/10
er easu and easy to understand plus the lore is simpl
It took me 140 amazing hours to beat the game.
I explored every corner of this well-crafted world , I've completed every dungeon in every area and every line of quests I've found. I even indulged in Frenzied Flame and then reversed the "curse" with Millicent Questline and Miquella's Needle. There is so many secrets and puzzles the world provide, the boss battles are fabolous       it's just incredible.
Elden ring is a must play !
Another great Soulsborne entry.
Qu√© decir de esta obra maestra que nos mete de lleno en un mundo oscuro y despiadado.
for the erd tree
if you want to buy this game buy iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit 10/10
When you play this game just play Aca Lukas (specifically By Pass by Aca Lukas) on Spotify and you'll finish this masterpiece in less than 5 hours.

This is the first souls-like game I've played and all the recommendations for those who are in doubt whether to play it.
I've played this game at least 5 times and it still doesn't tire me out.

Rise Tarnished.
i mean it's a ok game
Absolutely brilliant game with tons of replay-ability, totally worth the buy and can't wait till the new DLC.

too easy
Well what can i say, it's an amazing game.
This is one of my first souls-like game and i will have to say that it is one of the best games iv played.
The boss fights are all unique and have there own challenges to them but all are really enjoyable.
The story was rich and beautiful, so much to do with a open world map, the characters you meet along the way have there own story to tell and they are always great like Alexander The Great or Miriel Pastor of Vows
I am now starting Journey 3 to 100% the game ready for the new DLC.

10/10
The Horse Has A Giggidy Giggidy Gyat
yes
modern day self torture device

i love it
yes
nearly have a stroke trying to defeat a boss, quit the game, watch 2 hours of lore videos, boot the game up again, repeat.
10/10
Play Elden Ring. 

I was totally left speechless while playing this game for the first time on a ps4. (Yes I bought this game twice.) It took me roughly 150 hours to complete my first playthrough and it was a memorable experience with Lots of hardship against Margit, getting lost in Liurnia and getting sniped multiple times by a golem at Morne castle. 
I had to watch a video of who to kill to progress. It was Godrick at stormveil. 
Altus plateau and the capital is where Elden Ring really peaked in my opinion. Including the Ashen Capital. 
I can play this game over and over again. (500h total) There is so much variety for builds and so many secrets yet to be discovered. And to boot PvP and multiplayer. Even tho crossplay between ps, xbox and pc is not possible. The best game ever made. No doubt in my mind. 
Waiting for the DLC patiently. (i'm going insane.)

Play Elden Ring.
Worth the struggle
Only played for about 50 hours and I'm in love with this game. Don't recommend this to people who get angry easy, but just the challenge makes the game so fun. WORTH THE PRICE 100 PERCENT 11/10
hard
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.
good game hate it

yes
My game glitched and I got a TON of achievements peak game just for that!
It¬¥s a big love-hate relationship
best game ever, play it
‚Å£
Easily one of the best games of the last 20 years.
played game. good game. recommend game.
E
Good üëç
Best game of all time.
The game is so fun to play, though it may be hard, it's also super rewarding when you kill the boss you were fighting or the hoard of monsters that just kept swarming you.
your'e going to die a lot, but it's a rewarding game.
Stormvail is so bad so is the red dog have not even beaten them
It's just really damn good. If you're at all curious, please try it out. It might get difficult and you will face harsh roadblocks, but anything can be done with enough ambition.
.
I AM GOD OF ALL  RAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Literally the most fun in a solo game I've had in a while

only issues i had was the frame stutter with a high end PC, for some reason in after about 3 hours of play random FPS drops would start to happen and would require me to restart the game in order to play

GTX 4080, i9 12th gen, 64 GB DDR5

looked all over attempted multiple "fixes" in/out of the game, used a different pc still same issues (cbf listing specs)

worth the money, just remember to restart ur game if u think the stutters are to much for normal play
if u lyk watchin whiet chicks this game 4 u
yep
Much elden Much Ring

Most beautiful game i have ever played
Its Aight
might be my second favorite souls game after Bloodborne
In my opinion, the greatest game of all time. I wish I could experience this game for the first time, again. What a magical experience. (I have 500 hours on console, which is where I experienced the game for the first time.)
My friend bought it for me because I didn't like Souls games. I'm very glad he did. It's my new Skyrim. But better. LOTR meets GOT meets Miyazaki. It's definitely one of my favorite games. Highly recommend.
all the enemies just make you want to kys more as the game goes on
Best game souls like
lol, bonk
I liked just about everything.
underrated gem
Really great Fromsoft game. Probably their best work in terms of improving upon the souls formula. It does almost everything right. Things that were annoying to newcomers or in general are improved on such as fast travel on demand, really really frequent checkpoints, healing items are restored upon resting, simplified upgrade system and I can go on and on about the quality of life improvements. Lore and environment design is just top tier as always. Almost anything positive about previous games still applies to this one.

Though it suffers from some negatives that most open world games do but they tried their best to alleviate this. Open world activities such as the ruins, catacombs and caves all start to blend and feel really similar after a few and the similar designs of each don't help with this. Lots of recycled enemies as bosses which gets rather boring after some time.

With all that being said, I was hooked for a few weeks playing this nonstop. I definitely think it's worth playing or at least trying. They've made the game super accessible so no longer should you be worried about the difficulty. It's easily their most accessible game for everyone.
Its my first souls game for me, its superb amazing i like to explore around the map although always interrupt by some monsters and i like the story its fun to learn their past and lores and i like how to fight every bosses learning their moves and try to overcome it
was worth the 100%
*chef's kiss*
Ya good

Best investment a friend ever made for me 10/10 can't wait for dlc

Why is it always death?
Fun and hard

The game is pretty sick. One of my favorites of all time and thankfully one I can play with my girls. 

That said, if you get the bug where the game never loads you either need to verify your files or reinstall your operating system. Had a run in with it myself around 306 hours played. So hopefully you don't run into it.
i love fia
NO CURVEBALL, NO CHANGE-UP, NOTHING BUT F****** GASSSS
The greatest game ever made, I'm more hyped for a dlc than I have been for a standalone game in a LONG time
Great Souls game, a lot of the major bugs have been addressed. Love it Overall
Eleden ringu
I've played this game for 1000 hours. 

I've never done that with a game. 

enough said.
I gave my PS5 controller stick drift cause of this game. 10/10 my favorite game; DLC is coming up soon so I'd recommend giving it a try.

I could say so much more about this amazing game but I don't feel like it + I have to fix my controller.
after all these years i still have no maidens
One of the best games I've played in a long time and put too many hours into it and plan to put more into it
s'ok
GOAT
I recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge and story its a very great game I put this up their with Sekiro
Best game ever played , thanks fromsoftware for giving us such a route , you're the best out there <3
Perfect game 10/10
One of the greatest games of all time.

I may be 2 years late to the party, but ... the party is still still rockin!!

Amazing Game. Beautiful World Building. Endless Exploration. Unique Boss Fights. Engaging Combats and Build Diversity.

ITS A MEEE GODRRRIICKK
Prepare to DIE!
i got punted like a football by a cute amputee great game
great game
Honestly, I don't know what to think about Elden Ring anymore.
My first playthrough was amazing and I had a blast exploring every last bit of the world, but with every repeated playthrough it lost more and more of its initial magic, fun, and laid bare a lot of flaws.
I was just doing another playthrough to set myself up for the upcoming DLC, but I just couldn't deal with all the games bs anymore. 

[b]Positive ; [/b] 

-amazing world with lots to explore
-some very good and fun bosses
-the music is amazing
-combat is mostly good and there are a lot of fun builds you can come up with
-some very nice NPC's+Questlines (unless you miss them, which is most likely going to happen without a guide)
-a lot of Sites of Graces for fast travel, and very short runbacks to bosses if you end up dying.
-[strike]fun mods [/strike]
 
[b]Negative ; [/b]

-recycling of bosses and degrading them to random enemies is insane (and people complained about Dark Souls 2...)
-big bosses are janky as hell and you constantly fight the camera aswell
-almost every enemy, and especially bosses delay their attacks. Some more, some less. It just feels bad.
-input reading is so blatant that they didn't even try to hide it
-catacombs are the same terrible copy pasted mini-dungeons over and over again..and there are a LOT of them 
-gank squads + enemies behind pretty much every corner
-still very unbalanced
-Open World (yup, that one caused me to either be way too strong or way to weak all the time.)
-small delay / input buffer ; thanks, I hate it.


To wrap this up; Elden Ring is by no means a bad game, infact, it is a good one and 
I dont regret the money/hours spend on it.
I wouldn't be surprised if you'll have your fair share of fun with Elden Ring too.

As it stands now, however, I just cant look past it's issues and have to give it a no.
yes
Love  the game!
any game that isn't this game, needs to step its game up! this is the best game!
good
Greatest of All Time.
Don't see what people see in it, sure it looks nice but it's bad with mouse and keyboard and awful with a controller. wish I hadn't wasted a free game offer on it cos I can't even refund the crap
I mean it's ok
ive been playing this game with the seamless co-op mod recently and in my opinion is much funner than in the base game, im also really excited for the new dlc
The game has serious performance issues. Freezing and lagging constantly.
